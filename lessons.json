          "text": "Croatian alphabet is simpler than English and much more similar to German or\nSpanish.\nLetters b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, z are pronounced more or less as in English.\nThe letter g is pronounced always as in English go or get.\nThe following letters have a special pronunciation in Croatian:\nSpecific letters in Croatian\nc\nas tz in tzar\nč\nas ch in child\nć\nsimilar to č, a bit ‘softer’\nđ\nas j in joke\nj\nas y in you\nš\nas sh in ship\nž\nas s in pleasure\nSequences of letters dž, lj and nj are considered single letters in Croatian; they are\npronounced as follows:\nSpecific two-letter sequences\ndž\nsimilar to đ, a bit ‘harder’\nlj\nlike an l fused with a j\nas Italian gl (e.g. in figlia)\nor like English million\nnj\nlike an n fused with a j\nlike Spanish ñ (e.g. in señor)\nor Italian gn (e.g. in bagno)\nor like English onion\nThe 7 letters listed above (c to ž) and these two-letter sequences are Croatian-\nspecific letters and have a somewhat special role in grammar. (You can remember\nthem as consonants having ‘hooks’ on them, including j, having a ‘dot’ + letter c.)\nCroatian vowels are quite different than English vowels: they should be pronounced\nas Spanish or Italian vowels, as rather ‘flat’. Vowels can be either long or short\n(similar to English fit vs. feet) but in some cities (notably, Zagreb, Rijeka and Pula)\nthat distinction is lost.\nTherefore, I have decided not to mark long vowels, as it would be too complicated\nfor beginners: the rules are really complex and not respected in real life in many\n\nparts of Croatia anyway.\nAlso, most people in Croatia pronounce today ć the same as č, and dž the same as\nđ. This feature includes most cities.\nIn the Standard pronunciation of č and dž, the tip of tongue is pressed against the\npalate (top of the mouth) right above teeth, the teeth are separated, and there’s a\ngap between lips and teeth; it’s called apical pronunciation.\nThere’s a vowel ə (pronounced as e in English the) that’s never spelled; it appears in\nthe following situations:\n1. in seemingly impossible words like čvrst rigid, hard and krv blood: they can be\napproximately pronounced with the vowel ə (at least by some Croatian speakers)\nas čvərst and kərv. Actually, krv is pronounced a bit like English curve.\n2. the same goes for e.g. bicikl bicycle, which is rather pronounced as bi-ci-kəl (three\nsyllables).\n3. when talking about letters, Croatians often talk about the letter \"b\", and\npronounce its ‘name’ as bə.\nAlthough words should be pronounced as spelled, a great majority of Croatians\npronounce the sequence ije (when not at the end of the word) as just je, for\nexample:\nlijepo beautifully is usually pronounced as lje-po\nprije before is pronounced as written (pri-je), since the ije comes at the very end\nSome people pronounce lijepo as l-j-e-p-o (that is, l and j are separate sounds; this\nis regarded as standard), others as lj-e-p-o. To help you with the pronunciation, I’ve\nmarked such normally written, but not pronounced i’s like this: lijepo. In the words\nlike prije, where all vowels are normally pronounced, nothing is marked.\nThere are very few other situations where something is written but not pronounced\nin Croatian, they will be specially emphasized.\nCroatian spells the foreign names and places how they are originally spelled, if the\noriginal spelling uses the Latin script (e.g. New York, Chuck Norris), while in\nsometimes in Bosnian, and as the rule in Serbian, respelling according to an\napproximate pronunciation is used (Njujork, Čak Noris).\nStress (pronouncing one syllable a bit louder, as in English together) has quite\ncomplex rules and varies in colloquial speech in different parts of Croatia. Stress is\nnever indicated in writing (similar to the practice in English, but unlike Spanish or\nItalian), and you are simply supposed to know it.\nThere are two common ways (or schemes) of stressing words used in speech:\nThe standard stress is used in the Standard Croatian, and in cities of Split, Osijek,\nDubrovnik, and surrounding countryside; the area extends to Bosnia, and most of\n\nSerbia. This is what you hear on the Croatian Public Radio and TV (this is the\npronunciation you will find in language manuals and good dictionaries).\nFurthermore, the Standard Croatian has two kinds of stress (ways that one syllable\nin the word can be stressed): with the rising tone and the falling tone. It’s a bit\nsimilar to tones in Swedish or even Chinese. The stress in the Standard Croatian is\nvirtually identical to stress in the Standard Serbian or Bosnian, but many people in\nCroatia don’t use standard stress in everyday communication. Furthermore, rules\ngoverning standard stress are very complex (the stress changes in various forms of\none word) so I think it would be too complex to introduce tones in a course\nintended for beginners (this approach is followed by most language schools that\noffer Croatian; I will describe details later, in A9 Stress).\nTherefore, I decided just to mark what vowel is stressed, when the stress is not on\nthe first syllable (that’s the default place of stress). This map shows roughly (the\nshaded area) where the standard stress scheme (or something quite similar to it)\nprevails in Croatia and neighboring countries, at least in public settings:\nThe ‘western stress’ is used colloquially, very often heard in Zagreb, surrounding\nareas and some other cities, including Rijeka and Pula. You can hear it on local radio\nstations. This is the pronunciation I personally use in everyday life, at work, in\nschool, etc. (It’s sometimes, confusingly, called ‘urban stress’; you will find virtually\nnothing about it in textbooks.)\nThere are more stress schemes and ways to pronounce words in various dialects,\n\nbut they are more or less limited to small areas and villages. They will be briefly\ndescribed in the section on dialects.\nI won’t describe the stress schemes used in unshaded areas of Serbia and\nMontenegro. For some words, they are a very similar or identical to the ‘western’\nstress, for others, quite different.\nI will also mark the stressed vowel in the ‘western’ stress, when it’s different from\nthe standard stress position. For many words, there’s little or no difference, and for\nothers, there’s an obvious difference, as demonstrated with words ponekad\nsometimes and kolač cake (I have underlined the stressed vowels):\nword\nstandard\n‘western’\nponekad\nponekad\nponekad\nkolač\nkolač\nkolač\nAs you can see, some people pronounce the words ponekad and kolač with the\nstress on the first syllable, and some others with the stress on the second syllable.\nYou would never know it from the normal spelling, since stress is normally not\nmarked.\nTherefore, I marked the word ponekad and similar ones with two stress positions\n(that is, I have underlined two vowels). The first mark (from left) is always the\nstandard position and the second mark (if indicated) the ‘western’ stress position.\n  the first mark (if present):\n  standard stress\n\n  the second mark (if present):\n  ‘western’ stress\n\n\n\nponekad\nThe word kolač and many others are marked in the same way. (Such markings are\nmy invention. There are also standard stress symbols, but they are quite\ncomplicated and used only in specialized books. You can find more in Wikipedia and\nelsewhere.)\nBear in mind, if nothing is marked, the word is stressed on the first syllable. If there’s\nonly one mark, practically everyone pronounces the stress on the same syllable.\nThere are a few words where the standard stress is not on the first syllable, but the\n‘western’ stress is; one of them is the word for binoculars:\nstandard: dalekozor\n‘western’: dalekozor\n=   dalekozorʷ¹\nFor such words, I’ll underscore the standard stress position, and write in small\nsuperscript letters ‘W1’ after the word (i.e. ‘western’ stress on the 1st syllable), as\n\nshown above."

        "A suggestion. I have to admit, the standard stress scheme is quite complicated, even in my watered-down version. Try learning the standard stress scheme only if you want to speak roughly as news presenters on Croatian Public TV, or you really want to imitate speech from the shaded area. Otherwise, don’t bother with it, and go for the ‘western’ scheme. You’ll sound roughly like someone from the unshaded regions, which is not bad if your main goal is to communicate. Keep in mind, stress is not marked in normal writing at all. There are only couple of words that differ only by their stress, for example: frizer freezer frizer hairdresser (Again, pay attention that both marks, for stress, and for i’s usually not pronounced are just my inventions: nobody uses them in writing.)"

Such sentences\nare in the present tense and in the 3rd person.\nTo make them in Croatian, you need the 3rd person present tense form or the verb\n(I’ll call it pres-3 for short).\n(Verbs are words that mean an action or state, like listen, wait, eat, sit.)\nVerbs are normally listed in Croatian dictionaries in the so-called infinitive form (inf\nfor short).

For example, these two sentences in English have three words\neach and differ in only one word:\nI am cooking.\nI like cooking.\nHowever, the matching sentences in Croatian have 1 word and 2 words\nrespectively – and no words in common. Croatian, generally, uses less words than\nEnglish in an average sentence.\nIf you’re now asking why the verb čitati has the first vowel underlined, if the default\nstress is on the first syllable anyway (e.g. voziti is stressed on the first syllable\nwithout any special mark), be patient: you will get the answer in the following\nchapters.\nThere are few verbs where you need to change the last vowel in the present tense,\nfrom a to i.

I will not mark all such words. In most cases,\nif you want to obtain them, just replace -ije- or -je- in Croatian with -e-. Exceptions\nwill be marked: one of them are present forms of the verb piti, which are pijem, pije\nalso in Serbia. You can find more about “Ekavian” in A9 Bosnian, Serbian and\nMontenegrin.\nIn most coastal areas of Croatia, but not in the very south (i.e. Dubrovnik area) most\nwords that have -ije- or -je- in Standard Croatian, have -i- instead, e.g. instead of\npjevati, the verb is pivati. That’s called “Ikavian pronunciation”. You will find it in\ncasual writing, some novels, movies and pop songs.\nInstead of kuhati, the form kuvati is used in Serbia, and in parts of Bosnia and\nCroatia (however, it’s not standard in Croatian).\nIn Serbia, meaning dance is usually expressed with the verb igrati which has other\nmeanings (play) in both Croatia and Serbia."

It means that words change a bit\nwhen used in sentences. For instance, when you express what you are reading or\neven whom you’re waiting for – that’s called object. This ‘role’ requires a form of a\nnoun that’s usually called accusative case or sometimes the object case. Since\naccusative is a long word, it’s often shortened to just A.\n(Nouns are words standing for a more or less specific object, person or idea,\nsomething that can perform an action, e.g. sister, cat, or can be an object of an\naction, e.g. you can eat a pizza).\nNot all nouns change in accusative in the same way. Some don’t change at all. A\nlarge group of nouns in Croatian end in -a; they all change that ending to -u in\naccusative.

But the stress in\nбрат doesn’t shift: you have to learn by heart which nouns shift the stress... so\nCroatian is not that bad after all.\nOf course, this Russian stress shift corresponds to a change of tone in the Standard\nCroatian word for horse (falling in N, rising in A), but we can ignore tones in\nCroatian.\n• Examples\nPutujem I’m traveling, a pop song from Yammat – a Croatian band, despite its name\n– uses a really simple grammar in most verses:\nSvaka priča ima kraj\nEvery story has an end\nSvaki kamen zavičaj\nEvery stone a homeland\nMore ili planina\nA sea or a mountain\n(Saša Ljiljak)\nThe words svaka and svaki are different forms of the adjective svaki every, each.\nAdjectives are quite adaptive in Croatian; they will be introduced in 10 Gender.\nThe word zavičaj (which roughly translates as homeland, but the meaning is more\n\nputovati\nlocal) is in A, which is equal to N for it, according to the rules above. The following\nverse has a negation:\nPutujem i ne mislim\nI’m travelling and I’m not thinking\n  na tebe\n  about you\nThe construction na tebe is the preposition na on + pronoun in A; we literally say\n‘think on something-in-A’. Use of pronouns with prepositions will be introduced\nlater, in 34 Stressed Pronouns.\nYou can listen to it on YouTube™."

If you know some French, Italian or Spanish, such sentences should be\nvery familiar to you:\n(French)\nIl s’appelle Goran.\n\nlit.\n‘He calls himself Goran.’\n(Italian)\nLui si chiama Goran.\n(Spanish) Él se llama Goran.\nOn se zove Goran.\nIn all four languages, the verbs themselves mean call, but the meaning shifts when\nthey’re used with the so-called ‘reflexive’ pronoun (underlined in the examples\nabove). (Also, Spanish has the verb divertir that’s very similar to zabavljati.)\nUnfortunately, English doesn’t use this pattern at all.\nWe can list these meanings in a nice table:\nverb\nused with\nmeaning\nčitati\n(A)\nread\nprati (pere)\nA\nwash\nzabavljati\nA\nentertain\nse²\nhave fun\nzvati (zove) A\ncall\nse² + N\n... name is ...\nThe first verb has a non-mandatory object; the second one mandatory, and the last\ntwo shift meaning.\nActually, if you consider again the verb return, there was also a small change in\nmeaning: it’s not the same to return something and to come back! There are more\nsuch verbs where the meaning changes when they are used without an object.\nConsider the following:\nGoran opens the window.\nThe window opens.\n\npeći\nWhile in the first sentence, Goran does something to the window, in the second\nsentence, the meaning is completely shifted, as if the window is a subject that ‘does’\nsomething.

When these sentences are\ntranslated to Croatian, the se² is mandatory:\nAna kuha juhu. ®\nJuha se kuha, meso se peče.\n(After a comma in Croatian, word-counting restarts: both se²’s are in the second\nposition.)\nThis use of se² is common when the action described in a sentence is not performed\nby the subject (e.g. juha above) but by someone else, or just happens \"on its own\"\n(e.g. somebody just left the soup to cook). (Also, this explains why se² is used when\nsomeone wakes up on their own.)\nThis can be summed up as a simple rule: if in English meaning of a verb shifts\nwhen used without an object, when you use the verb without an object in\nCroatian, you have to use a se².\nIf you know any Spanish, everything so far most likely sounded very familiar to you.\nThere are three important differences, though: while in Spanish the ‘reflexive’\npronoun can be either me, te or se, in Croatian it’s always se².\nThe second difference is that se² must go to a fixed place in a sentence in Croatian.\nThe third difference is that in Spanish, the ‘reflexive’ pronoun is often spelled with\nthe verb when it appears after it (e.g. lavarse = ‘wash themselves’), the same holds\nin Italian (e.g. lavarsi) and some other languages. However, the se² is always a\nseparate word in Croatian.\nThese are the basics of se². I’ll explain details a bit later, in 64 The Door Opens: Fun\nwith se².\nFinally, there’s a rather strange verb that must use an object or a se²:"

I’m not using\nthat term, since it’s not a property of the verb, it just has the ‘reflexive’ particle with\nit. More precisely, the whole construction could be called ‘reflexive’. However, in\nmany languages, there are uses of such particle (or pronoun) that are not ‘reflexive’\nat all. You can check examples in Wikipedia (Reflexive verb) and you’ll see how\nCroatian examples nicely correspond to Spanish, French, Italian, German and\nsometimes Danish ones. Unfortunately (for learners) English grammar is quite\ndifferent in this aspect.\nWords behaving like se² – fixed to the second place in the sentence – are called\nsecond position clitics. Besides Slavic languages, they appear in a number of Iranian,\nNative American, Native Australian languages, and some others. Some older\nlanguages also had them, including Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and Hittite.\nLanguages with second position clitics are typically quite flexible and have no articles\n\ndizati\nsmijati se\n(words like the), as observed by linguist Željko Bošković.\n• Examples\nSmijem se I laugh is a pop song by Jinx, a pop band from Zagreb (note a very non-\nCroatian name). The song uses a lot of grammar we haven’t covered yet, but these\nlines are simple:\nI kada letim, kada sanjam\nAnd when I fly, when I dream\nKad se dižem, kada padam\nWhen I get up, when I fall\nThe verb dizati (diže) means lift, raise (something), but when you lift, raise yourself,\ni.e. get up, you have to use a se², like in the last line. The word kad(a) when has an\noptional vowel, and both versions are used in the verses above. We’ll learn more\nabout this word in the next chapter.\nThe chorus has some grammar which will be covered later, but it’s not too\ncomplicated to understand:\nSamo smijem se i smiješ se\nI just laugh and you laugh\ni sve je isto kao prije\nand everything is the same as before\nzamišljam [da ničega se\nI imagine [I don’t\nviše ne sjećam]\nremember anything anymore]\n(Gordan Muratović)\nWe see again se², but in the first line we have actually two statements joined by i¨\nand, so two second positions. In the third line, the da and everything after it is a kind\nof sentence-within-a-sentence, so-called clause, and the word da holds the 1st\nposition in it; the word se² would normally come right after, but here the word\nničega is put to the 2nd position, likely for rhythmic reasons. I have put the clause\ninto square brackets. Clauses will be explained in later chapters.\nThe word ničega is nothing, but in a case we haven’t explained yet: while most verbs\nuse objects in A, some, like sjećati se² remember want objects in other cases – this\nverb demands the so-called genitive case, which will be introduced later.\nNote the više + negation: not anymore.\nYou can find various performances on YouTube™. Check the performance on the\nCroatian public TV show A strana A Side and the original clip by Jinx.\nNote that the song uses the Standard stress."

          "text": "In many languages, including Croatian, each noun is assigned a gender. This is a\nslightly misleading term – it simply means what forms of other words you must use\nwhenever you refer to a noun.\nFor example, in English, when referring to a noun, you must use either he, she or it,\ndepending on the noun, but there’s no difference for most other words.\nIn German, you must use not only different pronouns, but also different articles (der,\ndie, das) and you have to adapt adjectives (kleiner, kleine, kleines) in some\nsituations.\nIn Spanish, you have to use different pronouns, different articles (el, la) and different\nforms of adjectives (rojo, roja).\nSince there are three different forms of pronouns in English, and three different\nforms of articles in German, we can say that English and German have three genders\n(in singular, there’s no difference in plural). There are two different forms of articles\nand adjectives in Spanish, therefore Spanish has two genders.\nThere are four genders in Croatian, but the difference between two of them is very\nsmall (and there’s no difference in plural). The gender in Croatian is similar to gender\nin Spanish: it’s usually assigned according to the last letter of a noun. For instance,\nkuća house is ‘feminine’ (since it ends in -a) in the same way as Spanish casa!\nIf you are familiar only with genders in English, this might be a bit surprising.\nConsider genders simply the way nouns are grouped. Houses are not feminine in real\nworld. The gender that kuća house and sestra sister belong to is called ‘feminine’\nsimply because a lot of words for really feminine beings (e.g. for woman, sister,\ndaughter) happen to belong to it.\nIt’s straightforward to tell gender of a noun for almost all nouns in Croatian. The\nrules are:\nnoun ends in\ngender\nsome exceptions\n-a\nfeminine (f)\ne.g. riba fish\ntata m Dad\nLuka m (name)\n-o or -e\nneuter (n)\ne.g. pivo beer\nauto m car ®\nMarko m (name)\nconsonant\nmasculine (m)\ne.g. stol table ®\nkost f bone"

It will be important a bit later.\n(In case you’re surprised that one gender is called neuter – that’s a fairly standard\n\nf\nm\nname for a gender that’s neither male nor female.)\nThere are exceptions – e.g. names Luka and Marko look as if feminine and neuter;\nin fact, both are masculine, and frequent male names. All personal names (for\npeople and animals) are either masculine or feminine (names ending in -o are\ntypically masculine).\nAnother exception – the noun tata – is actually masculine, it means Dad.\nIt’s actually only important to remember (and indicate) gender for exceptional\nnouns, and there are only 50-100 such nouns used in everyday life. For example:\nmost bridge — masculine as expected, no need to indicate gender\nkost f bone  — feminine, contrary to the common rules, so we must indicate its\ngender (f)\nThe biggest group of nouns that have unexpected gender are feminine nouns not\nending in -a. Almost all of them end in a consonant. Common ones are:\nbol f pain ®\nbolest f disease\njesen f fall, autumn\nkost f bone\nkrv f blood\nljubav f love"

          "text": "Some people think everything in a language serves some purpose. There has to be\nsome benefit from gender, from case marked by endings, and so on.\nHowever, I don’t think so. There was maybe a purpose once for many features, but\nnow we are just left with relics. For instance, why would the word noć night be\nfeminine? We know it’s inherited from very ancient times, since many related\nlanguages have a similar word, and it’s usually feminine: German Nacht, Latin nox,\nGreek νύξ nýx, Albanian natë, Lithuanian naktis etc. Therefore, the matching word\nwas almost certainly also feminine in the common ancestor of all these languages.\nBut we have no idea why it was feminine at all. Many things in languages are just so,\nand we don’t know why.\nIn a case you will read a grammar published in Croatia, names of genders in Croatian\nare muški rod (masc.), ženski rod (fem.) and srednji rod (neut.); for some unknown\nreason, they are always listed in that order. Unfortunately, Croatian textbooks and\ngrammars written for general population always mention only three genders...\nIt’s interesting that some Croatian style/grammar manuals (i.e. books and websites\nsuggesting what is “correct”) suggest that bol, when meaning physical pain, must be\nmasculine. This advice is ignored by virtually everyone, including government\nwebsites, textbooks, newspapers, scientific papers, etc. This is just in case you find\nsuch an advice somewhere: just ignore it.\nA small remark: Croatian nouns ending in -a, regardless of gender, are also called a-\nnouns; feminine nouns not ending in -a are also called i-nouns.\n\n• Examples\nThis list of side dishes from a small restaurant in Zagreb contains a number of\nadjectives:\nAs you can see, all items are translated to English. Interesting ones are:\nzelena salata literally means green salad – we don’t have a special noun for lettuce,\nthis phrase is used instead. Since salata is feminine (it ends in -a) the adjective zelen\ngreen must go to the feminine form.\nljuta mljevena paprika – again, paprika is feminine by the usual rule, so both\nadjectives before it get an -a. It’s interesting that the adjective ljut means both\nangry and hot (spice). We don’t use words related to heat to describe how spicy\nsomething is!\nsvježi kupus is literally fresh cabbage; the adjective is usually used to distinguish it\nfrom the fermented cabbage, i.e. sauerkraut (kiseli kupus). The adjective svjež fresh\nhere got at -i before a masculine noun, which is, strictly speaking, not mandatory,\nbut extremely common.\nkiseli krastavci is literally sour cucumbers, the noun is here in plural, which will be\ndescribed later (however, this noun simply gets an -i, as the adjective before it).\nurnebes (ljuti/blagi) is likely a specialty of the restaurant. The noun means roughy\nmayhem, pandemonium; the adjectives after it are still attached to the noun, so\nboth – the second one means mild – get that -i. Although adjectives normally\nprecede nouns, you will see them after nouns once a while, especially in menus.\najvar is a condiment made of baked red peppers, common in Balkan cuisine. Also,\nkajmak is not simply cream, but something specific for Turkish-influenced regions,\nall the way to Central Asia and Mongolia (check the Wikipedia entry)."

        "Warning. Some books give a rough rule that -a- is always lost, whenever anything is added. This is true for most adjectives with more than one syllable – but not for all. Also, it’s not the complete rule, as you can see from additional consonant changes that sometimes apply. Let’s put the adjectives above to use: Ivana je žedna. Ivana is thirsty. Ivan je žedan. Ivan is thirsty. As I have already explained, adjectives usually get an -i before masculine nouns, especially colloquially; but it doesn’t happen with all adjectives, e.g. dobar (dobr-) good is almost always used without -i: On je dobar prijatelj. He’s a good friend. Compare this with: On je stari prijatelj. He’s an old friend. Other adjectives with a specific case-base are often used without -i before masculine nouns as well. The following adjectives are used a bit differently than in English: debeo (debel-) thick lagan light(weight), ‘easy’ kratak (kratk-) short mastan (masn-) fat nizak (nisk-) low težak (tešk-) heavy, ‘hard’ Croatian uses težak heavy and lagan light in the literal sense: Kamen je težak. The stone is heavy. Kutija je lagana. The box is light. Croatian also uses these two adverbs to indicate difficulty, in a quite different fashion than in English (the word dosta is here just to practice adverbs a bit): Knjiga je dosta teška. The book is quite ‘heavy’. (= hard) Problem je lagan. The problem is ‘light’. (= easy) Next, the adjective nizak (nisk-) low is used to specify low height of things in Croatian:"

Therefore, you can immediately conclude\nthat adjectives in the feminine gender have the same form in nominative plural and\naccusative plural.\nAdjectives follow the pattern (but not the endings) of the majority of nouns in a\ngiven gender. For instance, feminine nouns in a consonant (e.g. noć f night, sol f salt)\nhave some cases identical (e.g. N and A singular), but it has absolutely no effect on\nthe pattern of adjectives, since such nouns are really a minority.\n(You’ll often see that in textbooks only three genders are mentioned and the\ndifference in the accusative case is not called gender. The division to four genders is\nthe simplest explanation, in my opinion at least.)\nFinally, you’ll see sometimes, in writing, that certain adjectives in A have endings like\nnouns, e.g. vidim crna konja. This is never used in everyday life and casual writing.\nSuch indefinite adjectives will be briefly described in 99 Aorist Tense and Other"

          "text": "The word rak means both crab and cancer, but when it refers to an animal, it’s\ntreated as masculine animate, and when it refers to the disease, it’s masculine\ninanimate.\nHowever, the name of a football club from Split, Hajduk, is usually treated as\nmasculine animate, even when referring to the club: it means highwayman, outlaw.\nVery few Croatian grammars treat gender in Croatian in a consistent way, by having\n4 genders. It’s much more common in Czech grammars (Czech is a close cousin to\nCroatian, with essentially the same system). However, Russian (which has essentially\nthe same system as well) is always described with three genders. There are even\npeople who claim that there have to be three genders, since it’s ‘natural’, and ‘this is\nwhat we were taught in schools’.\nIf we want to be precise, we can say there are basically 6 types of nouns in Croatian,\nbased on how they change (i.e. what endings they get) and what forms of adjectives\nand pronouns they require:\n\npron.\nadjectives\nnouns\nnoun endings\nona\nN -a, A -u\n‘feminine’\nnoć night\npattern α\n(‘i-nouns’)\nvoda water\npattern β\n(‘a-nouns’)\non\nN (-i), A -og\n‘masc. animate’\ntata dad\nkonj horse\npattern γ\nN = A (-i)\n‘“masc.” inanimate’ zid wall\npattern δ\nono, to\nN = A -o, -e\n‘neuter’\njezero lake\npattern ε\nForms of adjectives are called ‘genders’ by tradition (the problem is, many people\nusually consider only forms in N, so they see only 3 genders), and patterns of noun\nendings are called ‘declension classes’. While everyone heard about gender, very\nfew people are aware of declension classes. They are much less clear-cut than\ngenders: for instance, nouns like konj horse and sin son seem to belong to the same\nclass, but we’ll see they form plural a bit differently. Should we split them to two\nclasses? It depends on your viewpoint.\n(I’ve invented the names of patterns in the table above, I’m quite sure nobody ever\nused Greek letters for these patterns. You’ll find various names in various books:\nthey are ultimately unimportant. However, i-nouns and a-nouns are worth\nremembering.)\n• Examples\nCrno-bijeli svijet Black-and-White World is one of the most popular songs by Prljavo\nkazalište Dirty Theater, a rock band from Zagreb. The song opens with the famous\nline:\nMoje ime je Davorin Bogović\nMy name is Davorin Bogović\na ovo sve oko mene\nand all this around me\nto je crno-bijeli svijet...\nit’s a black-and-white world...\nCrno-bijeli televizori\nBlack-and-white TV’s\nrijetki noćni tramvaji\nrare night trams\nmoja bijela djevojka\nmy white girlfriend\nuvozni ekskluzivni program\nimported exclusive shows\nmama, tata, pas i kravata...\nMom, Dad, a dog and a tie...\n(Jasenko Houra)\nSee how mojN my and other adjectives adapt to the gender of nouns after them. All\nthe forms are in N, just different genders.\nThe second line has ovo sve, lit. these all; such forms will be explained later. It also\n\nuses oko mene, where the form mene will be explained later (it’s in the so-called\ngenitive case).\nThe fourth and the fifth line use plural forms, which are not yet explained, but for\nmasculine adjectives and many masculine nouns, it’s simply -i in N plural.\nThe sixth line has no racist implications whatsoever: everything around the guy is\nblack and white, no colors – and colors are perceived as good, i.e. color TV’s were\nnew and better than old black-and-white ones – and the girlfriend is just a part of\nthe black-and-white world, i.e. she isn’t anything extraordinary. The seventh line\nuses program which can mean many things; my translation as (TV) show is only one\npossibility.\nYou can find various performances on YouTube™.

However, keep in mind that German cases are\nreally not identical to Croatian cases!)\nThe DL case is used in thanking, which is useful when you get something. The phrase\nis:\nhvala na¨ + DL thanks for\nCroatian za¨ usually corresponds to English for, but not in this phrase. For example,\nyou could say:\nHvala na... Thanks for the...\n    ... čestitciDL. ...greeting card.\n    ... poruciDL. ...message.\n    ... poklonuDL. ...gift.\n    ... pomoćiDL. ...help.\nHere we’ve used another feminine noun that doesn’t end in -a: pomoć f help,\nassistance.\nThe DL case is also involved with possession, especially with body parts and related\npeople (e.g. family or friends). I already explained how in Croatian, words like my\n\nprati\nprati\nare less often used and possession is implied:\nAnaN pere kosuA. ‘Ana is washing hair.’ (= her hair)\nHowever, if she’s washing someone else’s hair, a common way – very common in\nspeech – to express it, is to add the person in the DL case:\nAnaN pere GoranuDL kosuA. Ana is washing hair ‘to Goran’. (= Goran’s hair)\nThis is the preferred word order in such sentences – it’s, of course, possible to\nrearrange words if you want to stress something. This is the same structure as with\nthe verb send or write – Goran will ‘get’ his hair washed, in the same way as he will\nget a message, letter or gift.\nPay attention that in the sentence above, kosu is in A – it is the object, after all –\nwhile Goranu is in DL. These two words are not attached to each other, don’t\ndepend on each other: this is just the most common word order in such\nsentences.\nCroatian has possessive adjectives – I’ve already shown moj my, others will be\nshown a bit later – but with body parts, this is the preferred way. If you are familiar\nwith German, you’ll notice it uses the same system: the sentence above would\ntranslate exactly as Ana wäscht Goran die Haare. Dutch and Romance languages do\nit in the same way.\nIn fact, English is famous for using a lot of possessive adjectives, while a great\nmajority of European languages use them much less often. In most languages,\npossession of body parts and many other things is simply implied – it’s expressed\nonly if something belongs to someone else, often by dative or something equivalent.\nIf your brain is spinning now failing to comprehend how DL can mean possession\nof a body part, here’s another way to look at the sentence above: Ana is washing\nthe hair, and doing it to Goran.\nThe accusative case of neuter nouns is equal to their default, nominative form. It’s\nnot so for the DL case, and it becomes important that some neuter nouns have\nspecific case-base as well, not shortened (like masculine ones) but lengthened:\ndijete (djetet-) child\npile (pilet-) chicken\nPay attention how ije in dijete changes to je in its case-base (such alternations are a\ncause of misspellings for many native speakers).\nThe next two verbs have a obligatory se² always with them (as explained already, it\nmust be the second word, if possible):"

(= belongs to Ana)\nI’ve already explained that possession of body parts is usually expressed with the DL\ncase. Is there any difference in meaning when possessive adjectives are used?\nUsually, there’s no difference, and DL is preferred with such nouns. However, here’s\na difference in some circumstances: DL implies a kind of close possession, while\npossessive adjectives don’t. Compare these sentences:\n(1) AnaN pere GoranuDL kosuA. Ana is washing Goran’s hair. (lit. ‘washing the\nhair to Goran’)\n(2) AnaN pere Goranovu kosuA. (lit. ‘washing Goran’s hair’ – the same\nmeaning?)\nThey don’t mean exactly the same. The sentence #1 implies that the hair is growing\nfrom Goran’s head, while the sentence #2 could also apply to cut hair being washed\nfor whatever reason.\nThis is a very fine distinction not important in most circumstances. (The ‘close\npossession’ is sometimes called ‘inalienable’, but the name is not precise – the hair\ncan be cut.)\nPay attention: in the DL possession, used for body parts, the noun for person is\nsimply in DL (Goran → Goranu). When you use a possessive adjective – which\nyou have to do to express possession of a ball, dog, house etc. – you have first to\nturn the person into a possessive (Goran → Goranov) and then add the right\nending for case and gender to it (e.g. Goranov → Goranovu for feminine A).\nWith relatives, it’s normal to use poss. adjectives, as above (check the sentence\nabout Ana’s sister). I’ll explain later when it’s more common to use DL for relatives\nas well.\nPossessives in Croatian are often used in street names, for example Branimir street\n– one of major streets in Zagreb – is actually Branimirova ulica Branimir’s street.\nThe word ulica street is often dropped when it’s obvious what we’re talking about.\n(With specific streets, you should use the preposition u¨):"

In some other languages (e.g.\nGerman) the genitive case is mainly associated with possession. In Croatian,\nexpressing possession is just one of many uses of the genitive case, and it’s not its\nmain use!\nNouns get the following endings in genitive:\nnoun type (N)\nG\nnouns in -a (≈ fem.)\n-a → -e\nneuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) -o or -e → -a\nmasc. nouns not in -a\nadd -a\nfem. not in -a (e.g. noć)\nadd -i\nAs for the DL case, the endings of most masc. nouns and or neuter nouns are the\nsame, and there’s no distinction for people and animals.\nWe can put it immediately to use. First, it’s used when English uses something-of-\nsomething, e.g.:\nkraj filma end of the movie\nThe second word is always in G, regardless of the role the whole phrase gets. If you\nuse the phrase when e.g. the DL case is required, only the first word changes:\nToN je na krajuDL filmaG. That’s at the end of the movie.\nThis construction is frequently used when something ‘belongs’ to something, but it’s\nnot possession:\nbroj telefona phone number\nvlasnik bicikla bicycle owner"

In fact, they can be considered stressed forms – you use\nthem only if you want to emphasize the subject (or sometimes, you have to use\nthem, e.g. in constructions like ja sam Amerikanac I’m American).\nHere are the forms for plural:\npronouns in plural\nperson\nN\nA, G\nDL\n1st\n(mi) nas²\nnam²\n2nd\n(vi)\nvas²\nvam²\nAgain, the DL forms have just a different final consonant.\nBear in mind that A, G and DL forms of pronouns must be placed in the second\nposition:"

        "® “Ekavian” forms, which dominate in Serbia, apply to the verb razumjeti (razumije)\nunderstand: its “Ekavian” form is razumeti, and the verb is fully regular.\nInstead of shvaćati, a slightly different form of the verb, shvatati, is used in Serbia\nand most of Bosnia.\n• Examples\nThe song U svakom slučaju te volim In any case, I love you, performed by Ibrica\nJusić (a masculine name, despite ending in -a) is, without any doubt, among the very\nbest love songs from Croatia in the last 100 years:\nVolim teA uvijek\nI always love you\nI kad se budiš\nEven when you’re waking up\nI kad na licuDL šminkeG nemaš\nEven when you don’t wear any makeup\nI kad si ljutaN\nEven when you’re angry\nI kad se čudiš\nEven when you’re wondering\n(Luko Paljetak)\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\npisati | 1\n2\nThe first two verses use grammar and words I’ve already explained. Almost each\nverse starts with i kad, literally and when. The third verse translates literally as and\nwhen you don’t have any makeup on your face: it uses G instead of A (i.e. šminke\ninstead of šminku) – it’s a way to express any, i.e. indefinite quantity. Such use will\nbe described in 45 Quantities and Existence.\nUvijek teA volim\nAlways I love you\nhoću da znaš\nI want you to know\nVolim teA\nI love you\nne znam kako da odolim\nI’m unable to resist\nU svakom slučajuDL teA volim\nIn any case, I love you\nThe construction hoću da znaš I want you to know uses a so-called desire clause.\nSuch things will be described in 56 Desires and Demands. (It uses the verb htjeti\nwant, which has irregular pres-1).\nThe part ne znam kako da odolim literally translates as I don’t know how to resist.\nSuch expressions will be also described later.\nCheck how in the verse u svakom slučaju te volim the word te² is actually the\nfourth word – the first three words count as one, they form a closed phrase. The\nword slučaj case is one of few nouns that can shift stress in DL – to the second\nsyllable from the end – when used with a preposition. The adjective svaki means\nactually each, every, but often corresponds to English all or any.\nPutting the word uvijek to the first place is emphasizing it.\nThe next verses contain the DL form mi²:\nVolim teA uvijek\nI always love you\nI kada sanjaš\nEven when you’re dreaming\nKad ne pišeš miDL\nWhen you don’t write to me\nKad teG nema\nWhen you’re not here\nThe word mi² is here in an unusual place (there’s a lot of liberty in poetry). In speech,\nyou will only hear kad mi ne pišeš.\nBoth kad and kada are used in this song for rhythmic reasons – there’s no difference\nin meaning.\nThe last verse uses the negative existential construction, explained above.\nYou can listen to it on YouTube™."

If\nsomething like that happens, je² always comes after any pronouns.\nSuch words with fixed second-place position always come in a ‘block’ and cannot be\nrearranged:\nČesto miDL je hladno. ‘It’s often cold to me.’ = I’m often cold.\nGramatically, the sentence is still impersonal: there’s no subject anywhere. The\n‘experiencer’ is in the 1st person, but the verb is the 3rd person, singular. The verb\nje² doesn’t change, regardless of who feels cold:\nHladno namDL je. ‘It’s cold to us.’ = We’re cold.\nThis use of impersonal je² with DL is frequently seen with the following adverbs:"

You\nwill hear such forms, and see them spelled sometimes with an apostrophe (i.e.\nček’o, iš’o).\nIn many regions, especially in smaller towns and villages, there are other forms of\npast-m, e.g. ending in just -l; for more information, check A8 Dialects.\nInstead of jučer, a slightly shortened juče is used in Serbia and Bosnia. Instead of\nkino, the word for cinema used in Serbia and Bosnia is bioskop.\n“Ekavian” forms, which dominate in Serbia, are much simpler for verbs in -jeti: from\ne.g. videti, past forms are video, videla, from razumeti – razumeo, razumela, etc.\nIn parts of Croatia and Bosnia, you often hear (and sometimes read) generalized\n“Ikavian” forms, where such verbs have all past endings in -i-, e.g. vidio, vidila, vidili,\netc.\nThe aorist tense is much more common in Bosnia and Serbia.\n• Examples\nImala je lijepu rupicu na bradi She had a nice little hole on her chin is a popular song\nfrom 1980’s performed by late Oliver Dragojević, a very popular Croatian pop\nsinger. Most songs he performed were in various “Ikavian” dialects, but this basically\nstandard.\nObserve how the name of the song implies she from using the past-f form imala.\nThe song is basically all in the past tense. The first verse contains osobit particular\ntransformed into an adverb osobito particularly. The second verse contains druge,\nwhich is the feminine plural form of drugi other, another, here used as a pronoun\n(like other ones) but feminine, which cannot be exactly translated to English: it can\nbe understood as other women, other girls, basically other female ones (recall 18\nThis and That). Plural forms will be explained in the next chapter.\nNije bila osobito lijepaN\nShe wasn’t particularly beautiful\nali nije bila kao drugeN\nbut she wasn’t like other women\npa je ljubavN, kao uvijek slijepaN\nso love, blind as always\nzbog njeG razneA prelazila prugeA\ncrossed various tracks because of her\nThe third verse literally has ‘like always blind’. The fourth verse has razne pruge\nvarious tracks split by the verb! This is not common in speech, but not\nungrammatical; it’s here for rhythmic reasons. You know the adjective refers to the\nnoun since they match in gender (feminine), number (plural) and case (A). The word\n\npruge means stripe, but also track (e.g. railroad). This verse has also zbog nje\nbecause of her, where a stressed form of the pronoun is used. Stressed pronouns\nwill be explained in the following chapters.\nIn the chorus, the word rupica means small hole (while rupa is just hole): Croatian\nhas many words for small versions of things. They will be described in 85 Small and\nCute: Diminutives.\nImala je lijepu rupicuA na bradiDL\nShe had a nice little hole on her chin\nznala je da grebe, znala je da gladi\nshe used to scratch, she used to stroke\nimala je lijepu rupicuA na bradiDL\nshe had a nice little hole on her chin\ndrhtali smo složno, smeteniN i mladiN\nwe shivered in unison, confused and young\n(Momčilo Popadić)\nThe phrase znala je da grebe is a bit ambiguous; it would be more common to say\nznala je grebati, which is still ambiguous; the intended meaning is likely she used to\nscratch; this will be explained in 32 Love and Like.\nYou can find various performances on YouTube™."

Birds are singing.\nMany verbs that end in -a in pres-3 have – in the Standard scheme – the stress in the\npres-3pl on the same syllable as in the inf, regardless of stress in other present\nforms. This is a rather small detail, and even if you’re trying to learn the Standard\nstress, you might just ignore it.\nIf we want to express what more than one subject is doing (or their state) we can\nlink them with the following word:\ni¨ and\nFor example:\nAnaN i GoranN pjevaju. Ana and Goran are singing.\nIvanN i DamirN jedu. Ivan and Damir are eating.\nThere’s a common way to express mutual action, corresponding to English each\nother – just use se²:\nAnaN i IvanN se vole. Ana and Ivan love each other.\nAs you can see, here se² is actually the fourth word, since the words Ana i Ivan are\ntreated as one ‘unit’.\nThis use explains farewells like vidimo se and čujemo se – they mean we see each\nother (later, again) and so on. If you know a Scandinavian language, e.g. Swedish,\nyou’ll notice it has exactly the same construction:\n(Swedish, Danish, Norwegian) Vi ses! = Vidimo se!\nThis literally translates as we see-s, where the appended -s means each other. A\n\ndifference is that Croatian uses a separate word se², and of course, Swedish, Danish\nand Norwegian have (like English) mandatory pronouns with verbs.\nWe can also say (we use oni for an all-male or mixed group):\nOniN se vole. They love each other.\nThere’s another way to express the mutuality, by a small phrase jedan drugog (all\nmale/mixed) or jedna drugu (all-female). Both literally mean one another:\nAnaN i IvanN vole jedan drugog. Ana and Ivan love one another.\nWe would use the plural form one only for all-female groups.\nThis is maybe the right place to describe ‘impersonal plurals’ – like in the English\nsentence they’re building a new road. This is exactly the same in Croatian, but you\nhave to leave the pronoun out:\nGrade novu cestuA. They’re building a new road.

For most terms, the default gender is\nmasculine. You simply use the masculine noun in plural, but the meaning is rather\ngeneric or mixed.\nHowever, for some animals, the default gender is feminine. Such animals are:\nfeminine\nmasculine\ncow\nkrava\nbik bull\nvol ox\nfox\nlisica\nlisac (lisc-)\ncat\nmačka\nmačak (mačk-)\nduck\npatka\npatak (patk-)\n(There are more.)

Not so\nin Croatian: the singular is bakterija and the plural is only the expected form\nbakterije.\n• Examples\nMirno teku rijeke Rivers flow peacefully is a song from 1959. It starts with simple,\nbut poetic verses:\nMirno teku rijekeN\nRivers flow peacefully\nmirno žitaN šume\nwheat hisses peacefully\nsvjetloN njiše misliA\nthe light sways thoughts\nmisliN njišu šumeA\nthoughts sway forests\nThe verb teći (teče, tekao, tekla) flow is one of few verbs having pres-3 in -ku,\nalready mentioned above. The verb šumiti means boom, but the English likes hiss\n\nprštati\ntaknuti\nwith sounds of grain and tall grass. Using žito corn, grain in plural is unusual: it’s here\nforced to make the corresponding verb plural, so it can rhyme with the plural of\nšuma forest.\nThe noun misao (misl-) f thought is one of feminine nouns not ending in -a, and\nmaybe the only one ending in -o. Note the verb misliti think is clearly related to this\nnoun. The verb njihati (njiše) means rock, sway.\nIn the last verse, both nouns (misli and šume) could be in either N or A – these forms\ncoincide in plural. So it falls back to the word order (the same as in English) to\nunderstand what sways what.\nThe following verses have some weird features which are rare in speech. The form\nptica is genitive plural – it looks the same as N in writing for this noun – a case which\nwill be introduced later: normally, it would be let ptica flight of birds, but the word\norder noun-noun-in-G is inverted here, which is almost never done in speech and\nnormal writing:\nPticaG letN šara svodA\nFlight of birds scrawls the vault\npršti pjevN u jasni vedri danA\nsinging frizzles on a bright clear day\njasni danN, vedri smijehN\nclear day, cheerful laughter\nvedar čovjekN nikad nije samN\na cheerful man is never alone\nThe verbs šarati scribble, scrawl and prštati (pršti) sputter; fizzle, sizzle are not really\ncommon. The construction u jasni vedri dan uses u¨ + A because it’s about time\n(recall u srijedu etc.). The adjective jasan (jasn-) is precisely clear (and then\nobvious), while vedar (vedr-) means without clouds (and then cheerful), but this word\nplay is impossible to translate to English.\nThe following verses start with maštom – it’s the word mašta imagination in a case\nwhich is yet not introduced (the instrumental case):\nMaštomI takneš\nWith imagination, you touch\n  svaku travkuA, cvijetA\n  each blade of grass, each flower\ntu si velikN tiN, i tvojN je svijetN\nyou’re big here, and the world is yours\nOnda mirN, samo mirN\nThen peace, only peace\nrijekaN, šumaN, plavi svodN i tiN\nthe river, the forest, the blue vault and you\n(Drago Britvić)\nObserve the inversions velik... ti and tvoj... svijet, to make it rhyme with cvijet\nflower.\nThe verb taknuti (takne) touch is essentially a perfective verb, but it’s nevertheless\nused here in the present tense (poetry...).\nYou can find various performances on YouTube™; check this performance on A\nstrana.\nThis song launched the career of Vice Vukov, one of the most important Croatian\n\nsingers – whose life story is worth reading."

Was he afraid?\nI used the abbreviation (colloq.) to remind you that these are colloquial sentences in\nCroatian ®. It’s very often seen and heard, e.g. on the wall in a (fancy) bakery:\nThis translates as Have you ever tasted a fresher sandwich? – the word kad, in\nyes/no questions, can mean ever as well (this will be explained in more detail in 41\nSomewhere, Nobody, Everything...).\nYou will sometimes hear and read questions with these two words contracted to\ndal, or spelled together as dali.\nAnother option is to use the standard way, but without li:\nJesi gledala filmA? (colloq.) Did you watch the movie?\nYet another quite colloquial option is to put je li to the front, frequently contracted\nto just jel (also spelled as je l, je l’):\nJel ideš u školuA? (colloq.) Are you going to the school?\nJel ste gladniN? (colloq.) Are you hungry?\nJel si gledala filmA? (colloq.) Did you watch the movie?\n\nići\nJel se bojao? (colloq.) Was he afraid?\nAlso, colloquially, it’s possible to turn normal sentences into a question just by\nchanging their intonation – sentences end on a higher tone, and are spoken faster –\nno rearrangement of any kind is needed:\nIdeš u školuA? (colloq.)\nGledala si filmA? (colloq.)\nBojao se? (colloq.)\nHowever, with just the present forms of biti (je² +), there are questions like this\noften heard:\nJeste gladniN? (colloq.)\nAll the ways of making questions described above are used in real life, unlike some\nformal terms that actually nobody uses (e.g. formal hladnjak vs. colloq. frižider\nfridge). For example, here are some statistics (by Google™ search) from the\nCroatian discussion site, forum.hr:\nform\n  hits\njesi li gledala\n3280\nda li si gledala\n1420\njesi gledala\n11800\nThere’s another, special type of questions, asking for advice or an opinion.

Something (a body part,\nshirt...) always does something (itches, ‘hurts’) to someone. In Croatian, the first\nsentence translates as:\nSvrbi meA nogaN. ‘The leg is itching me.’ = My leg itches.\nOne who gets affected is in accusative, and the body part or anything else that\ncauses feelings is the subject of the sentence, and therefore in nominative. What is\nthe source of feelings is often put to the end.\nThis, a bit unexpected use of cases, is sometimes called inverse assignment. What\nyou expect to be a subject actually isn’t, at least grammatically.\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\nf\nIf you use personal pronouns, they of course must be at the second place, but if you\nuse general nouns or names, they are usually put to the first place. They must be in\naccusative, since they are really objects: legs, shirts, etc. are itching them:\nAnuA svrbi nogaN. ‘The leg is itching Ana.’ = Ana’s leg itches.\nSuch placement is common in Croatian: if you express someone’s feelings or\nexperience, it’s normal to put him or her to the front, regardless of case. Recall this\nexample:\nAniDL je bilo dosadno. (DL) Ana was bored.\nPain is expressed in exactly the same way:\nBoli meA zubN. ‘The tooth is hurting me.’ = My tooth hurts.\nNote how in both sentences, the subject (a body part, here noga, zub) comes after\nthe verb. This is the default word order in such sentences; you can tweak it to\nemphasize the body part by putting it first.\nYou must bear in mind that leđa and usta are always in plural, despite everyone\nhaving just one. Since they are subjects, verbs must be put into plural as well:\nLeđaN meA bole. ‘The backs are hurting me.’ = My back hurts.\nUstaN meA svrbe. ‘The mouths are itching me.’ = My mouth itches.\nWe haven’t learned plural of masculine nouns yet, but for both prst and zub, it’s\nsimply made by adding an -i:\nGoranaA bole zubiN.

Ivan was driving (Ivan N)\nTkoN je vozio? Who was driving?\nFor the accusative case (contrasted with the question about the subject in N):\nGoranN čeka AnuA. Goran is waiting for Ana. (Anu A)\nKogaA GoranN čeka? Who is Goran waiting for? (A)\nTkoN čeka AnuA? Who is waiting for Ana? (N)\nEnglish questions could also be written with whom (whom is Goran... ) – that’s\nrecommended by many use guides, but increasingly rare in real life. You could think\nabout whom as an almost extinct object case form of who, corresponding to\nCroatian A and DL.\nExamples for the DL case:\nAnaN je pisala IvanuDL. Ana was writing to Ivan. (Ivanu = DL)\nKomeDL je AnaN pisala? Who was Ana writing to?\nKnjigaN pripada AniDL. The book belongs to Ana. (Ani = DL)\nKomeDL pripada knjigaN?

It historically\nhad specific endings, but today its endings – for nouns – look like G endings.\nHowever, if we were paying attention to vowel length, we’d see that the G ending\nfor nouns ending in -a, e.g. kod žene is a long vowel e, while the ending in e.g. dvije\nžene is a short e.

          "text": "We have just learned how to count things – at least up to 4 things. But there’s\nanother way of counting, with words first, second etc. They are usually called\nordinals or ordinal numbers, and behave as adjectives in Croatian. Their forms are:\n1 prvi first\n2 drugi second\n3 treći third\n4 četvrti fourth\n5 peti fifth\n6 šesti sixth\n7 sedmi seventh\n8 osmi eighth\nOf course, the adjective drugi also means other.\nFor higher numbers, you should just add -i to them, if they consist of only one word:\n17 sedamnaest → sedamnaesti\n40 četrdeset → četrdeseti\nIf a number consists of more than one word, just change the last word into the\nordinal form; if a number is in a compact form (without the i) just change the last\npart:\n31 trideset i jedan → trideset i prvi\n31 tridesetjedan → tridesetprvi\nPay attention that all ordinals are adjectives, i.e. they change case, gender and\nnumber when needed:\n17th sedamnaesti (masc. N)\n        sedamnaestom (masc. DL)\n        sedamnaestu (fem. A) etc.\nOne thing the ordinal numbers are used for in Croatian is for dates. In Croatian, e.g.\nthe year 1932 is understood as the ‘1932nd year’ or just the ‘thirty-second’ year.\nIn Croatian, when you want to say that something happened (or happens, or will\nhappen) on a given day, month or year (expressed as a date), you should put the\ndate in the genitive case.\nBilo je toN trideset i drugeG (godineG). lit. ‘It was in the 32nd (year).’ = It was in\nthirty-two.\nAlso, days in a month are referred to as the first, the second (the same is in English,\nbut in the genitive case), and Croatian treats months in the same way: the first\nmonth (in a year), the second... ®. Normally people would just say:\nRođenN sam petog osmogG. ‘I am born on the fifth of the eighth.’ = I am born on the\nfifth of August.\nOf course, both petog and osmog are genitives of ordinal adjectives peti and osmi\n(in masc.), since it’s just short for petog dana and osmog mjeseca – and both dan\n\nići\n(\n)\nj\np\ng\ng\nj\nand mjesec are masculine.\nIn the Croatian writing of numbers, ordinal numbers are abbreviated to just number\n+ a period, so it’s usually written:\nRođenN sam 5. 8.\nThis is the word used to describe a specific date:\ndatum date\nIf you want to talk about a date related to an event, you add the event in the\ngenitive case:\ndatum rođenja date of birth\nTo say that something happened/happens sometime in a given month, use u¨ + DL:"

        "® In Serbia, ordinal numbers are usually not used for months (except when reading\ndates written as numbers); specific names – different than Croatian – are used even\nin the colloquial speech:\n1 januar January\n2 februar February\n3 mart March\n4 april April\n5 maj May\n6 jun / juni June\n7 jul / juli July\n8 avgust August\n9 septembar (septembr-) September\n10 oktobar (oktobr-) October\n11 novembar (novembr-) November\n12 decembar (decembr-) December\n\n3pl\nmirisati\nf\nAs you can see, these names are similar to the English names. Those names also\nprevail in Bosnia and Montenegro, and are sometimes used in Croatia too. Ordinal\nnumbers for months are infrequent in Bosnia and sometimes used in Montenegro.\nThe following words are less often used in Serbia and Bosnia (words more common\nthere are listed on the right side of arrows):\nkat → sprat\nkupaonica → kupatilo\nured → kancelarija\n• Examples\nThese banners on the Museum of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb advertise an exhibition\nabout the sixties:\nYou can also see how the dates of the exhibition are written on the banners.\nThe song Moja prva ljubav My First Love, also known as Djevojke u ljetnim\nhaljinama volim Girls in Summer Dresses I like was a hit by Haustor, a band from\nZagreb. The song has very short lyrics:\nDjevojkeA u ljetnim haljinamaDL volim\nGirls in summer dresses I like\nLjubim ihA u leđaA\nI kiss them in their back\nmirišu na smoluA\nthey smell of resin\nmojN je gradN večeras dobio lukuA\nmy town got a port this evening\nUljeN je na vodiDL\nThere’s oil on the water\ntoN je, toN je...\nthat’s, that’s...\nmoja prva ljubavN\nmy first love\n(Srđan Sacher)\nThe first verse contains a case yet unexplained: DL in plural. The verb mirisati\n\n(miriše) can mean either pleasant or unpleasant smell, and what something smells of\nis expressed with na¨ + A. If you’re puzzled by imagery in this song, it’s from a\nperspective of someone living inland and imagining his town became a seaside town\nfor a while, with the smell of resin from pine trees and oil from boats in the port.\nNote how the verb ljubiti kiss uses a destination.\nThe song has unusual word order in some verses: normally, you would put the verb\nfirst in the first verse. The fourth verse has moj grad my town (or my city) split by\nstrict placement of the verb je².\nThe verb dobiti (dobije) get is another perfective verb.\nYou can listen to the song on YouTube™, but there aren’t many videos for copyright\nreasons. Check a great performance by young singers on the Croatian public TV\nshow A strana A Side, which are joined by the original singer (Darko Rundek)."

For those who can choose when they want to use these days, there’s a whole\nart of creating mini-vacations, by merging weekends with public holidays.\nThe adjective čajni is also used in čajna kobasica, literally tea sausage. This is often\nshortened to just čajna, since the feminine form of the adjective is seldom used in\nany other expression. However, it originally had nothing to do with tea; it seems it’s\na corruption of China.\n\n• Examples\nThis sign shows directions to a dog beach, which is literally beach for dogs in\nCroatian:\nThe construction with na¨ + A is, a bit paradoxically, used to express ways of\nentering or leaving – which door to use – e.g. on this notice (I found it on a bakery)\nthat the entrance is through the other door:\nThis is a bit unexpected if you consider it a location.

Conversely, forms like pariski are very rare in\nCroatia.\nInstead of proljetni, a more regular adjective proljećni is used in Serbia and\nMontenegro, and sometimes in Bosnia; instead of osoba → osobni, lice → lični\ncovers that meaning in Serbia and Bosnia.\nThe noun stol table has the form sto (stol-) in Serbia and most of Bosnia, and the\nderived adjective is a bit unexpected stoni.\nThe noun večer f evening has the form veče (večer- f) in Serbia and most of Bosnia,\nbut the derived adjective is the same, večernji.\nAdjectives ending in -ji (e.g. dječji) have alternative forms ending in -iji (e.g. dječiji)\nthat actually prevail in Serbia and Bosnia and are accepted in standard there. They\nare sometimes seen in Croatia as well.\nInstead of šalica, the words šolja and šoljica are used in Serbia and parts of Bosnia.\nInstead of naočale, words naočare and naočari are more common in Serbia and\nmost of Bosnia.\nIt appears that -ski is a bit more favored in Bosnia and Serbia: for example, from the\nnoun autobusʷ¹ there’s autobuski there, while there’s autobusniʷ¹ in Croatia.\nSpellings such as naprimjer are not standard in Serbia, and are partially accepted in\nBosnia and Montenegro."

Also, note that Damir Urban uses the Standard stress, or something very\nclose to it.\nThe questions ima li te and ima li tu mjesta use the verb imati have in existential\nphrases; for more details, see 45 Quantities and Existence.\nThe verb ušuljati («) se² means sneak in.

However, for almost all verbs, it will never be\non a prefix in the ‘western’ pronunciation: it will stay on the same syllable as in the\nunprefixed verb.\nSome verbs make their perfective verbs by prefixing na-:\ncrtati ~ na- draw, sketch\npuniti ~ na- fill\nslikati ~ na- paint (image)\nhraniti ~ na- («) feed\npisati (piše) ~ na- («) write\nučiti ~ na- («) learn\nThe stress in nahraniti, napisati and naučiti doesn’t move to the prefix in the\ninfinitive, but (only in the Standard pronunciation!) it does move in the present tense:\ntherefore, their present tense forms are nahrani, napiše and nauči. I will, as usual,\nindicate such shift in the present tense with just a («).\nOthers use o- or pro-:\nbrijati (brije) ~ o- shave\nprati (pere) ~ o- (») wash\nbuditi ~ pro- («) waken\ngutati ~ pro- swallow\nThe stress – both Standard and ‘western’ – in oprati moves one syllable to the right\nin the present tense: opere; I will abbreviate such stress shift with a (»), as above.\nOther pairs have more complicated ‘relationships’. Here are the main types of pairs\n(besides prefixing pairs). A common type involves a change of verb ending:\nbacati ~ baciti throw\nprimati ~ primiti receive\nWithin this scheme, most pairs always change the final consonant before the\nending:\nplaćati ~ platiti pay\nprihvaćati ~ prihvatiti accept ®\nvraćati ~ vratiti return\n(It’s worth remembering that, in such pairs, the impf. verb most often has a\nCroatian-specific consonant, while the perf. verb has an ordinary consonant.)\nMany verbs in this scheme also change the vowel before the final consonant, always\na vs. o:\nodgađati («) ~ odgoditi («) postpone\notvarati («) ~ otvoriti («) open\nAnother scheme, used by many pairs, is that impf. verbs have -ava-, and the perf.\nverbs just -i- or -a- (some pairs have change of consonant as well):\npokušavati («) ~ pokušati try\nukrašavati ~ ukrasiti («) decorate\nFinally, there’s a very common scheme – likely, including the highest number of verb\n\nnapisati | poslati | 3m/n"

There’s no simple rule how to make a perfective verb – the pairs must be\nlearned, but most of them fall into the small number of schemes above.\nWhen should you use perf. verbs?\nPerfective verbs are almost never used in the true present tense, for an ongoing\naction. However, it is possible to use perf. verbs in the present tense – if we use the\npresent tense to describe things that happened in the past and will happen in the\nfuture, especially when adverbs često often and ponekad sometimes are used:\nPonekad napišem pismoA i ne pošaljem gaA. Sometimes I\nwrite a letter and don’t send it.\nWhy have I used perf. verbs, e.g. poslati (pošalje)? Because sending is not something\nwhere any progress matters (e.g. even reading a few pages from a book can\nmatter). Sending is normally done in one go, not split into parts. So it’s only\nimportant that the action was not completed. The first sentence talks about\naccomplishments. Letters are completed, but not sent.\nFor most verb pairs, in the past tense, perf. verbs are usually used, unless the action\nwas interrupted, you describe what you were doing at some moment, or it’s not\nclear what the outcome was. Also, you can tell how long something was happening\nonly if you use an imperfective verb, e.g. these adverbs of time can be used only\nwith imperfective verbs:\ndugo for a long time\nkratko for a short time\nFor example:"

Unfortunately, this doesn’t apply to all verbs with an ‘underline’: the verb\nčitati moves stress neither to ne¨ nor to a prefix.\nDid I say the standard stress is quite complicated, even in my watered-down form?\n• Examples\nThis pop song from the 1990’s, S dlana Boga pala si, performed by En face – a\nCroatian band from Rijeka, despite its name – featuring Damir Urban, was a major\nhit.\nIn the following verses, there are both perfective verbs (highlighted) and\nimperfective verbs:\nS dlanaG BogaG pala si\nFrom the palm of God you fell\nI anđeluDL si krala mirA\nAnd were stealing peace from an angel\nKao kišaN rasula kapi sveA\nLike rain, you scattered all the drops\nU peharA skupljam tvoje riječiA\nInto a chalice I’m collecting your words\n  i pogledA i tvoj prahA\n  and look and your dust\n(Vlado Simcich Vava)\nThe two perf. verbs are:\npasti (padne, pao) perf. fall\nrasuti (raspe) perf. scatter, spill around\nThe second verb has a quite unexpected present tense form. They represent events\nin the past which are done, completed, no need to go into details. But there’s also\nan impf. verb in the past tense in the verses:\n\nkrasti (krade, krao) impf. steal\nHere the focus is on the process, and not on the completion. If the song had ukrala,\nwhich is the past form of perf. steal, it would mean the angel lost the peace. I tried\nto translate this difference with the English Past Continuous Tense. Pay attention\nhow the angel is in DL: literally, ‘stealing the peace to an angel’.\nBesides, this song contains a number of poetic constructions which are very rare in\nnormal speech. For example, instead of expected sve kapi all drops, the order\nadjective-noun is inverted; then, check the position of si² in the first verse, and so\non...\nYou can listen to it on YouTube™."

(colloq.!) We intend to go to the beach.\nThere’s nothing special about the past tense, just use the verb in the past instead of\npresent, the other verb stays in inf:\nŽeljela sam jesti jabukuA. I wanted to eat an apple. (I = female)\nMorao sam jesti jabukuA. I had to eat an apple.

If you would mistakenly translate the last sentence word-for-word, you would get: (wrong translation!) I want you to see. This is an example where the word order in Croatian is completely different than in English, and it simply doesn’t carry the meaning English order does. (How to express I want you to see will be explained in 56 Desires and Demands. If you’re impatient, it’s želim da vidiš.) Check also the past tense: Željela teA je vidjeti. She wanted to see you. (!) You’ll sometimes see another construction, which uses verb + da + verb in the present tense, both verbs in the same person. In such a construction, the word da restarts word-counting and holds the first position: Želim da jedem jabukuA. I want to eat an apple. Želim da teA vidim. I want to see you.

        "® In Serbia, infinitives are less often used: in speech, the form da + present prevails\nalmost completely. For instance, the first sentence in Serbia would rather be\nbasically always Želim da jedem jabuku. You will sometimes hear such\nconstructions in Croatia and Bosnia as well.\nFurthermore, Standard Serbian insists that the verb trebati cannot be used\npersonally at all with another verb, so instead of e.g. Trebam jesti jabuke, the only\nstandard option is:\nTreba° da jedem jabukeA.\nThe past-m form htjeo is frequent in Bosnia.\nInstead of kava, a slightly different word kafa is common in most parts of Bosnia\nand Serbia. In Bosnia, the form kahva is used as well, especially in parts where\nBosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) live.\nIn Serbia, the verb smjeti (smije, smio, smjela) be allowed to is used in the “Ekavian”\nform, which is just smeti; the verb is fully regular, but like “Ekavian” razumeti\nunderstand, its pres-3 is smeju. Besides, it has an additional meaning dare.\nIn Serbia, it’s common to use the verb probati in the present tense as well, unlike in\nBosnia or Croatia.\n\nmoći pres-1\nmoći pres-1\nmoći pres-1\nmoći pres-1\n• Examples\nThis web page I took screenshot of says I want to work in the Post — it recruits new\nemployees for Croatian Post.

Prajo & A. Kunštek)\nThe adjective neki is here used as an indicator of indefiniteness. There’s no\npossessive adjective in Croatian verses for srce heart; it’s obvious whom it belongs\n(but it could have been expressed as well).\nThe verb reći say is another perfective verb. It’s also quite irregular, and it will be\nexplained in later chapters.\nYou can listen to it on YouTube™."

The verb (bude) is kind of\nperfective; however, it’s not normally used in past or future tense, unlike other\nperfective verbs, but it can be used in the present tense when we talk about things\nthat happen any time:\nČesto bude hladno ujutro. It’s often cold in the morning. (or It often gets cold...)\nTherefore, Croatian has two forms of the present tense of verb biti: the irregular je²\nstanding for real states and events, and the regular bude used only in special cases\nwhere it stands for potential, possible or desired states.®\nUsing this special verb, we can simply replace the forms of auxiliary je² in the past\ntense with the forms of bude and create another tense – the potential future tense:\npast tense\nsam², si², je²...\n+ past form\npotential future\nbudem, budeš, bude...\n+ past form\nIn the Standard Croatian, you cannot simply use the potential future tense or the\nverb (bude): it can be used only in specific constructions."

I don’t like (TV) series, but I like\nthe Westworld.\n(Note how Croatian uses different verbs here; you could use voljeti (...) in both parts\ntoo.)\nAnother example is a complete correction vs something just unexpected or\nuncommon:\nJanetN nije iz HrvatskeG, nego iz KanadeG. Janet isn’t from Croatia, but from Canada.\nJanetN nije iz HrvatskeG, ali zna hrvatskiA. Janet isn’t from Croatia, but she ‘knows’\nCroatian. (i.e. speaks)\nIf you’re unsure about ali vs nego, there’s a simple test: if you can rephrase the\nsentence with instead (e.g. we went to a restaurant instead) or with rather, you\nshould use nego instead of ali.\nThere’s a simple way to emphasize that all\nsubjects/actions/objects/places/whatever are involved, like in English both... and....\nIn Croatian, simply an i¨ is placed before each emphasized item:\nI IvanN i AnaN rade. Both Ivan and Ana are working.\nSobeN su i u prizemljuDL i na katuDL.

          "text": "It’s finally the time to learn the genitive case in plural! Unfortunately, it’s not a\nsimple form to create. For start, nouns get the following endings:\nnoun type\nG-pl\nnouns in -a (≈ fem.)\n-a → -a* (or -i)\nneuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) -o, -e → -a*\nmasc. nouns not in -a\nN-pl -i → -a*\nfem. not in -a (e.g. noć)\nadd -i\nFor example:\nGoranN se boji mravaG. Goran is afraid of ants.\nAs this form coincides with G singular, the sentence could also mean Goran is afraid\nof an ant.\nIn the beginning, I wrote I will disregard vowel length, i.e. differences between long\nand short vowels, since many people in Croatia don’t have that difference in their\nspeech. However, those that keep the difference, and Standard Croatian, have the -\na in G-pl always long – while -a in other case endings is always short – so forms\nmrava (G) and mrava (G-pl) are not really pronounced the same. That specific length\nin G-pl is sometimes indicated in writing by putting a circumflex sign over the long\nvowel: mravâ. It’s by no means mandatory, you will see it from time to time. (A\nrecent Croatian orthography manual recommends using a macron – a line over\nvowel – instead, e.g. mravā; it’s still very rare.)\nThere are no twists for nouns ending in -a, -o or -e preceded by only one consonant:\nnouns just get -a in G-pl.\nOther nouns can get a kind of ‘lengthening’ (I indicated it by an asterisk).\nHow does it work? If a neuter or feminine noun would have two consecutive\nconsonants just before the genitive plural -a, an additional a gets inserted between\nthose consonants:\npjesma song → pjesama\nsestra sister → sestara\nzemlja ground, country → zemalja\ncarstvo empire → carstava"

Also, pay attention that lj, nj and dž are single\n\nconsonants.\nThis insertion never happens if those last two consonants are either st, št, šć, zd, žd\nor žđ (so-called non-splittable sequences):\nzvijezda star → zvijezda\nmjesto place → mjesta\nMasculine nouns that get short plural endings, and end in a consonant, get the -a\nalways attached to their nominative form, even if they have a specific case-base:"

It has not too complicated grammar. The form potraži is\nnot yet explained – it’s called imperative, and it’s used to form commands:\nPotraži meA u predgrađuDL\nLook for me in the suburbia\nNa uliciDL, na raskršćuDL\nOn the street, in the intersection\nGdje tiDL je jorgovanN rasuo perleA\nWhere the lilac scattered your beads\nGdje namDL je proljećeN dotaklo usneA\nWhere the spring touched our lips\n  i pobjeglo\n  and ran away\nThe third and fourth line contain possessive DL, one time for perle beads (not\npearls), another time for usne lips. In the last three verses, perfective verbs from\nthese difficult pairs are used:\nrasipati ~ rasuti (raspe, rasuo) scatter\ndoticati (dotiče) ~ dotaći (dotakne, dotakao, dotakla) touch\nbježati (bježi) ~ pobjeći (pobjegne, pobjegao, pobjegla) run away\n(You probably see now the case endings are not the most complex feature in\nCroatian.)\nNote that suburbia – especially at the time the song was written – was the poorer\nouter part of cities in Croatia, with narrow, sometimes unpaved streets, and small\nhouses.\nPotraži meA u predgrađuDL\nLook for me in the suburbia\nKraj vlakovaG što prolaze\nBeside the passing trains\nBit ćemo samiN u svitanjeDL danaG\nWe’ll be alone in the dawn of the day\nBit ćemo samiN u pjesmamaDL pticaG\nWe’ll be alone in songs of the birds\n  ko nekada\n  like long ago\nThe word kraj means beside when used with a noun in G; the same can be expressed\nwith pokraj. The construction vlakovi što prolaze means passing trains, literally\ntrains that are passing. The third and fourth line is of course the future tense. The\nword ko is a colloquially shortened form of kao like, as.\nThe first line uses nouns rublje clothes, underwear and cvijeće flowers: they are so-\ncalled collective nouns – they stand for a whole heap of things, but are in singular\n(they will be explained in #47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Counting Children):\nDrijemaju jedraN od rubljaG i cvijećaG\nSails of cloth and flowers nap\nČekaju vjetarA da nekuda plove\nThey wait for the wind to sail somewhere\nČuješ li, našeN nasA predgrađeN zove\nDo you hear, our suburbia is calling us\nTraže teA kućeDL i ulice stareN\nOld houses and streets are looking for you\n\n(Drago Britvić)\nThe second line contains a so-called purpose clause – the part after da, explaining\nintentions – which will be explained later. In the third line, naše predgrađe is split by\nA nas²; this is kind of strict placement. The last line has an adjective after the noun,\nwhich is not uncommon in poetry.\nThis song has been popular for five decades so far, and there are many\nperformances on YouTube™. Check a performance on A strana, a cover from\n1980’s, and performances from 1960’s by Lado Leskovar and Đorđe Marjanović\n(which is partially “Ekavized”).\nThe song was composed by – at the time – a little known 21-year-old student of\nelectrical engineering from Split, a math lover and self-taught composer: Zdenko\nRunjić. Over the following 40 years, he composed about 700 tunes, many of them\nbecoming major hits, today considered classics of Croatian popular music."

In Croatian, ‘leave’ is a motion, going somewhere else. It\nwon’t take two days (or a week) to get there, you will rather go somewhere, spend\n\nsome time there, and then you’ll return, and the whole thing will take two days (or a\nweek).\nIn Croatian, if you want to express duration of the whole ‘round-trip’, that is, going\nsomewhere – staying there – going back, where going back is implied, you have to\nuse the preposition na¨ + A:\n(1) Odlazim na dva dana24.\n(2) Otići ću na tjedanA danaG.\nIf you construct the sentence #1 without the na¨, it will sound extremely weird, as if\nyou spent two days trying to leave, but you haven’t left yet.

(Colloquially, you will also hear and\nsometimes read zato jer in such sentences.)\nAll such sentences express reasons that caused something: it rained and it made the\ngrass wet. However, it’s possible that somebody is doing something because he or\nshe wants something to happen later (or, not to happen). In English, such sentences\nlook like these:\n(1) I took an umbrella [so (that) I don’t get wet].\n(2) I need ten kunas [to buy a sandwich].\n(3) I’m learning Croatian [so (that) I can talk to Ana].\n(4) I’ll buy you a new phone [so (that) you can call me].\nThe sentences above contain clauses in square brackets known as purpose clauses.\nEnglish here uses a variety of conjunctions (to, in order to, so that, so). Croatian is\nway simpler – it just uses one word: da. These four sentences translate as:\n(1) Uzeo sam kišobranA da se ne smočim.\n(2) Trebam deset kunaG da kupim sendvičA.\n(3) Učim hrvatskiA da mogu razgovarati s AnomI.\n(4) Kupit ću tiDL novi telefonA da meA možeš zvati.\nWe have here used the perfective member of the verb pair (because we want\nsomething done and accomplished, not just going to shops and checking stuff):\nkupovati (kupuje) ~ kupiti buy\nNow, there’s a special rule: verbs after da should be in the present tense only.\nPerfective verbs are often used (e.g. in sentences #1 and #2). The verb smočiti is a\nperfective verb that can be used with an object (in A) meaning make wet, but with\nse² it means get wet. (There are many verbs like that.)\nAs with jer and zato što, any fixed-position words come right after da, e.g. check the\nsentence #4:\nKupit¹ ću² tiDL² novi telefonA [da¹ meA² možeš zvati].\nThere’s another special rule: instead of the verb biti (je² +), the potential verb (bude)\nmust be used in purpose clauses:\nTrebaš kaputA [da tiDL ne bude hladno]. You need a coat so that you don’t get\ncold.\nIn such sentences, the potential verb (bude) is often translated as English get or\nbecome.

        "® In Serbia and Bosnia, instead of hlače f pl. pants, trousers, pantalone f pl. is used.\n• Examples\nHaustor (meaning entryway, doorway, in inland parts of Croatia, from German),\nfronted by Darko Rundek, was a very popular band from Zagreb, still very popular in\nmany former parts of Yugoslavia. This song, Bi mogo da mogu Could if I could (a\nconstruction yet unexplained) is from 1988:\nUvijek s malo, premalo paraG\nAlways with little, too little cash\nKad upale se svjetlaN, ode dimN\nWhen lights turn on, smoke leaves\nA mirisN noćiG\nAnd the smell of night\nopet postaje stvaranN\nis becoming real again\n(Darko Rundek, Srđan Gulić)\n\nThe noun pare f pl. is a colloquial word for money. The verb upaliti («) is a perfective\nverb meaning ignite, turn on. Here nobody has turned on the lights, they ignited,\nturned on, so a se² must be used.\nThe word a¨ in the third line will be explained in the following chapters: it’s another\nword for and. We have the verb postajati (postaje) become in that line, and, as\nexpected, what it becomes is again in N (stvaran real, which agrees with miris, a\nmasculine inanimate noun).\nKo mnogo putaG do sada\nLike many times before\nOnN sanja\nHe’s dreaming\nKako beskrajno pada...\nOf falling endlessly...\nThe word ko is a colloquial form of kao as, like.\nThe lines on sanja kako beskrajno pada contain a content clause, which will be\nexplained in 59 Knowing and Telling: Content and Noun Clauses. It literally means\nhe’s dreaming that he’s endlessly falling.\nBilo je rano jutroN tada\nIt was early morning then\nkad je ostavio sveA\nwhen he left everything\nČulo se samo kako pticeN pjevaju\nOnly birds singing could be heard\nOnda je stajao još dugo\nThen he was standing for a long time\ns druge straneG uliceG\non the other side of the street\nThe verb pair ostavljati ~ ostaviti leave (e.g. keys) was introduced in previous\nchapters. It’s, of course, also used to leave everything. Compare it with the second\nline, where otići (ode, otišao, otišla) leave, depart is used, because the smoke goes\naway, departs.\nThe line čulo se samo kako ptice pjevaju will be explained later, in 80 Present\nAdverbs and Adjectives. It contains also a content clause and a se²-passive, which\nwill be explained in the following chapters.\nThe construction s druge strane ulice means literally ‘from the other side of the\nstreet’, but the meaning is on (such use will be explained in 76 Inner, Outer, Step by\nStep: More on Space and Time).\nYou can listen to it on YouTube™. Note that Darko Rundek mostly uses the\nstandard stress here, despite being from Zagreb."

You will\nsometimes see and hear it shortened to nek.\nWhat about impf. and perf. verbs in negative imperatives? In many cases, perf.\nverbs make no sense in negative imperative. Consider this:\nNemoj pročitati knjiguA. Don’t read the book. (perf. = the whole book)\nIt would mean: you can read the book, just don’t read the whole book. Makes no\nsense. However, it makes sense with some other verbs and objects:\nNemoj jesti kolačeA. Don’t eat the cakes. (impf. = not even a tiny bit)\nNemoj pojesti kolačeA. Don’t eat up the cakes. (perf. = not all of them)\nThe first sentence means don’t even start eating them, while the second one means\ndon’t finish the cakes, i.e. leave something. This example is also interesting:\nNemoj bacati knjigeA u smećeA. Don’t throw books into the trash. (impf. = any book,\nanytime)\nNemoj baciti knjiguA u smećeA. Don’t throw the book into the trash. (perf. = a\nspecific instance/book)\n(I’ve used nemoj to negate impf. imperatives, but I could have used ne bacaj and ne\njedi in the previous example instead).\nThe first sentence is about throwing any books, or an unspecified group: you can\nthrow one today, another the next day, etc. It forbids any throwing. The second one\nis about throwing a specific book, which can be thrown only once, and then it’s gone.\nIn other circumstances, we would use bacati even for a specific object – you can\nthrow a specific ball many times against a wall.\nThe rule is: when we do something to a specific object – something irreversible, so it\ncan be done only once – we use perf. verbs in negative imperative.\nFor example, we don’t want somebody open a window. Since windows can be open,\nand then easily closed, and open again, and we don’t want any of it, we would use\nan impf. verb:\nNemoj otvarati prozorA. Don’t open the window. (impf.)\nBut, for breaking a specific window, we would use a perf. verb, since it’s an\nirreversible action (true, windows can be repaired, but it cannot be done\nimmediately):\nNemoj razbiti prozorA. Don’t break the window. (perf.)\nContrary, if we would speak in general, not about a specific window, or a specific set\nof them, we would use an impf. verb:\nNemoj razbijati prozoreA. Don’t break windows. (impf.)\n\n1\nSo, this is a way Croatian expresses indefiniteness of objects: by using imperfective\nverbs for irreversible actions.\nThere is another “special verb” – hajde – also having only imperative forms, that is\nused to encourage (like c’mon!):"

        "® In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, which completely prevails in Serbia, there’s an\nexception in speech from this rule for the “Ekavian” verb razumeti understand: its\n\nf\nimper-2 a bit unexpected razumi, and so on. However, Standard Serbian insists on\nthe imper-2 form razumej – according to the above rules – which is followed by very\nfew people in real life, and a source of endless debates on the Internet about what\nis ‘right’. Even very educated public figures in Serbia vowed they will stick with\nrazumi, regardless of what the official Serbian grammar says.\nStandard Serbian insists on the imper-2 forms boj and broj, which are rare in speech,\nwhile Croatian allows boji and broji.\nUsing impf. verb in imperatives to say that we want somebody to start immediately\ndoing something seems (to me) less common in Croatia, and more common in\nBosnia and Serbia.\n• Examples\nThe song Sanjaj me Dream of me, was the breakthrough hit by Novi fosili in 1977;\nthey soon became the most popular Croatian pop group.\nThe song contains just two parts, both are sung twice. The first part has a\ncharacteristic melody:\nUgasnut će jednom ljubav našaN\nOur love will die out once\nNegdje drugdje gnijezdaA ćemo sviti\nWe’ll weave nests somewhere else\nUspomeneA odnijet će vrijemeN\nTime will carry away memories\nU albumuDL ni slikeG neće biti\nThere won’t be a single picture in the album\nNote how the word order is unusual, subject coming last, emphasizing words that\ncome first, adjectives coming after nouns. The phrase negdje drugdje somewhere\nelse (lit. ‘somewhere elsewhere’) is very common. The verb sviti (svije) perf. bend,\nweave is seldom used, mostly with gnijezdo nest as the object. The verb odnijeti\nperf. carry away is irregular; it will be explained in 65 Carry, Bring, Drive: Transport\nVerbs.\nThe rare verb ugasnuti (ugasne) perf. go out, die out was also used in the song used\nas an example in 43 And, Or, But: Basic Conjunctions – both are written by the same\nperson.\nThe last verse uses ni + G to enhance negation, meaning not even a; such\nconstructions will be explained in 67 Only, Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion.\nThe second part, the chorus, has a simple melody. The form sanjaj is an imperative.\nThe Croatian verb sanjati dream can be used both with A and o¨ + DL, and using just\nA if quite common.\nThe second verse is a time clause (they will be explained in the next chapter). Within\nit, there’s za me for me i.e. preposition + short form of pronoun, which is archaic in\nspeech in most regions (za mene is normally used) but found in poetry. That verse\ncontain a negative existential phrase with two things in G, linked by ni¨.\n\n1 | 1\n1\n1\n2 | ući | f\nSanjaj meA, sanjaj meA noćas\nDream of me, dream of me tonight\n[Kad za meA nema\n[When, for me, there’s\nspokojaG ni snovaG]\nno tranquillity nor dreams]\nNoćas meA sanjaj\nDream of me tonight\njer možda već sutra\nbecause maybe already tomorrow\nU snoveA tiDL uđe ljubav novaN\nA new love will enter your dreams\n(Dea Volarić)\nThe last verse has possessive DL for dreams. Note how again the adjective comes\nafter ljubav f love. The verse has also present tense of the perfective verb ući (uđe,\nušao, ušla) come in, enter used to express future, which is not standard, but\ncommon in speech in Zagreb and the region around it.\nNote how each verse has a pronoun, three have me², the fourth one ti².\nRajko Dujmić, a member of Novi fosili, heard a short poem by Dea Volarić on the\nradio and decided to compose a tune. Then a young poet, Volarić wrote this poem\nwith some others in her notebook as a teenager. A number of them became hits for\nNovi fosili.\nYou can listen to it on YouTube™; check many covers.\n\nprestati\notići past-mpl\nići"

(colloq., sometimes) When\nthe lunch time comes, I’m not really hungry.\n(The baš i is here a way to say really. There’s no comma: in colloquial writing,\ncommas are often left out.)\nSecond, the mandatory negation after dok + perf. verb to express until is... not\n100% mandatory. It can be (rarely) left out. It’s not really clear if there’s a small\ndifference in meaning or not; I don’t think there is.\nThese two weird things collide.

You have to express a subject even when it\ndoes not make any sense (e.g. it rains). When you express desires, you basically\nexpress wishes about someone or something (don’t worry, it will get really clear\nsoon). Croatian is quite verb-oriented – subjects are usually omitted, they cannot be\nexpressed when they would make no sense; when you express wishes, you express\nthat you want something to happen.\nThis sounds really abstract, but an example will make it perfectly clear:\nX = onaN she\nY = (onaN) pleše she dances\nNow, how to express that you want X and then Y in English? The sentence I want X\njust takes an object you wish (X), and if it’s a pronoun, it goes to the object case (the\nequivalent of the accusative case in Croatian):\nI want X = I want her.\nHowever, if you want Y, you have to rephrase the action, you still want her, but to\ndo something:\nI want Y = I want her to dance.\nFrom she dances we arrived to her to dance, quite a transformation in English.\nSpanish is verb-oriented, like Croatian, but it requires a special form of verb\n(subjunctive) after que in desired or imagined events...

There are other\nclauses that start with da and are of indicative-type, as you’ll see soon.\nAlso, there are clauses that don’t fall into any of types above, e.g. time clauses with\nkad – they have special rules.\nThere are four more common verbs (actually, two of them are verb pairs) that use\nan object and a clause of atemporal-type:\nmoliti (+ A) (+ DC) kindly ask\npozivati («) ~ pozvati (pozove) (+ A) (+ DC) call, invite\nslati (šalje) ~ po- (+ A) (+ DC) send\nzahtijevati («) (+ od G) (+ DC) demand\nThe DC stands, of course, for a ‘desire clause’.

        "® There’s a preference in Serbia (actually, the preference is stronger more you go to\nsoutheast) to use atemporal clauses starting with da instead of infinitive clauses:\nŽelim [da pijem čajA]. I want to drink tea. (Serbia, esp. southeast)\nSince da bude is then used instead of biti (due to the the rule in atemporal clauses)\nmany Serbian grammars consider bude as the pres-3 form of the verb biti be, which\nis just absurd, especially from the Croatian standpoint.\n\nf\n1 | kazati\nIn Bosnia, instead of kruh, hljeb is mostly used; in Serbia, it’s “Ekavian” hleb.\nIn Bosnia and Serbia, mobile phone is called mobilni (changes as an adjective).\nIn Serbia, there seem to be no difference in volio bih da... vs volio bih + inf, and\ninfinitives are rare in speech there anyway.\n• Examples\nThe song Korak od sna A step away from dream, is a pop song by Prljavo kazalište\nDirty Theater, a pop-rock band from Zagreb, from 1983. It has fairly simple lyrics:\nJedan tako običan danN\nOne so ordinary day\njedna djevojkaN\none girl\nkojuA jedva da znam\nwho I barely know\nI jedan prazan stanN\nand an empty apartment\ndovoljan razlogN\na sufficient reason\nza još jednu lažA\nfor one more lie\nThe construction koju jedva da znam is a relative clause: they will be covered in the\nfollowing chapters. The noun laž f lie is another feminine noun not in -a to\nremember.\nThe next verses are simple, note that Croatian never switches case in constructions\nlike you and me: only ‘you and I’ is possible when in position requiring the N case:\nTiN i jaN\nYou and me\nmiN smo korakA sad od snaG\nwe are now a step away from dream\nIn the expression korak od sna, korak is actually a quantity, and therefore in A\n(which is equal to N for this noun). If we would take e.g. sekunda second, the\nmatching expression would be sekundu od sna.\nAnd then we have a desire clause in the following verses:\nNe želim [da miDL kažeš\nI don’t want [you to tell me\no sebiDL sveA]\nall about yourself]\njer ovoN nije vrijemeN\nbecause this is not a time\nRomeaG i JulijeG\nof Romeo and Juliet\nmoje namjereN nisu lošeN\nmy intentions aren’t bad\no ne, jaN ne ostavljam\noh no, I don’t leave\nnikakve tragoveA\nany tracks\n(Jasenko Houra)\nThe preposition o¨ about requires DL, and consequently reflexive DL sebi is used.\nThe normal word order would be ... sve o sebi, but it’s tweaked here to make it\nrhyme.\nYou can listen to it on YouTube™. Check the performance on A strana and the\noriginal version.\n\ng"

However, marenda or\npomidor are very common.\nThere are also triplets where all three terms are common in real life:\n\nStandard\ninland\ncoast\nscrew (noun)\nvijak (vijk-) šaraf\nvida\nslice (of cake, bread) kriška\nšnita\nfeta\nYou can find more about features of language colloquially used in most coastal\nregions in 78 Dijete vs. Dite. (Note that colloquial use in Croatia includes also many\nnovels, poetry and popular songs.)\nYet other colloquial words are restricted to just one age group, usually teenagers\nand young adults, e.g. frend friend (feminine version: frendica). It’s used at many\nplaces, but not by many grandmothers.\nEnglish has many word pairs, where one word is an inherited Germanic word, and\nanother came from French or Latin (e.g. freedom/liberty, stay/remain, etc.).\nCroatian has similar pairs, where one word is inherited from Slavic, while another is\nTurkic or Greek:\n\nSlavic\nTurkic/Greek\nbed\npostelja\nkrevet\nwell\nzdenac (zdenc-) bunar\nkerchief\nrubac (rupc-)\nmarama\nBoth words are used, and interestingly, often Turkic or Greek words prevail in\nstandard use, even in actual speech, while Slavic prevail in some (western and\ncoastal) regions, which were less influenced by Turks, and are found in poetry.\nBesides colloquial words, there are colloquial ways of expressing various things. One\n\nsuch thing is telling time in 12-hour manner, and in quarters and halves. It has two\nvariants, inland and coastal:\ntime\ninland\ncoast\n14:00\ndva\ndva\n14:15\nfrtalj tri\ndva i kvarat\n14:30\npol(a) tri ®\ndva i po(l)\n14:45\ntri frtalj tri\ntri frtalja tri\ntri manje kvarat\ndva i trikvarat\n15:00\ntri\ntri\nObserve that inland, number of quarters is relative the last full hour, but expressions\nuse the next hour! This is a quite non-obvious way to express time. This is similar to\nways in Southern Germany and Austria (and frtalj (frtalj-) comes from German\n‘viertel’, meaning quarter). The same non-obvious scheme is common in Hungarian.\nThis is only a very shallow outline of the real language diversity in Croatia. If we\nwould add neighboring countries (i.e. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia)\nwe would have more variation, especially in terms related to home and cooking,\nnames of various tools, etc. Terms in Serbia sometimes are more common with\ncolloquial terms in inland Croatia, due to the common German influence, so\nparadajz is spoken in both Zagreb and Belgrade; however, there are also many\nterms used in Serbia which are almost unknown in Croatia. A very brief overview of\nsuch terms is given in A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin."

However, it is often replaced in\ncolloquial speech in Dalmatia. Of course, when što starts a real question (što\nmisliš...?) it’s normally replaced by šta.\n• Examples\nThe song Sve je u redu Everything is OK by Flyer, a pop-group from Zagreb, contains\na number of desire and content clauses.\nThe first verse uses the verb skrivati hide and, as usual, it’s just lice face – the\npossession is implied:\nNe skrivam osmijehA s licaG\nI’m not hiding the smile from my face\nŽelim [da znaš\nI want [you to know\n[Da sveN je u reduDL\n[Everything is OK\novaj danA]]\non this day]]\n(Mirko Kovač)\nThe second verse has a desire clause that contains a content clause (in the third\nverse). The word je² is the third word in the clause, likely due to rhythmic reasons\n(but also you can treat sve je u redu as a kind of phrase).\nThe following lines have a content clause in a content clause, but the inner clause\nstarts with kako (it could have started with da without any difference):\nMislim [da ne misliš\nI think [you don’t think\n[kako svemuDL je krajN]]\n[everything is over]]\nAl sveN je u reduDL\nBut everything is OK\novaj danA\non this day\nThe line svemu je kraj is the construction:\nbiti (je² +) kraj + DL\nIt means something (expressed in DL) is over.

The first one is derived from the verb pair:\nstavljati ~ staviti put, place\nThese verbs are simple to use – just use A for what you put, and a destination (unlike\nin English!) for where you put something:\nStavio sam pivoA u frižiderA. (colloq.) I’ve put the beer in the fridge.\n\n3m/n\n(I marked this as colloquial, but the Standard Croatian noun hladnjak is very rare in\nreal life.) Of course, you can also specify the location of the destination, i.e. where\nthe fridge is (e.g. u frižider u kuhinji).\nThe verbs are derived from this pair in the same way as with the stand pair: the\nsame prefix is attached to both verbs and we get a new pair with a different\nmeaning than the original one. Two pairs we have already encountered:\nostavljati ~ ostaviti leave (a thing)\npretpostavljati ~ pretpostaviti suppose, assume\nThe verb pair ostavljati ~ ostaviti is frequently used with a metaphoric location na\nmiru in peace, in meaning leave alone, that is, not interfere:"

There are frequent discussions in Serbia which one of these\ntwo verbs is ‘right’ (or ‘better’). A number of Serbian ‘linguists’ have been opposed to\nspasiti for decades, but it appears to be more common in Serbia than spasti (...)!\nHowever, you will occasionally encounter spasti (...) in Croatia as well.\n“Ekavian” forms, which completely dominate in Serbia, have e instead of je or ije in\nalmost all places, but this replacement doesn’t apply to suffixes forming passive\nadjectives! While the “Ekavian” form of voljeti love is voleti, the “Ekavian” pass.\nadjective is voljen. The same applies to all other pass. adjectives formed with -jen.\nIn Serbia, few pass. adjectives have the regular šć where they don’t in Croatia: one\nof them is korišćen. However, forms with šć are also used colloquially in parts of\nCroatia, including pass. adjectives that have št in Standard Serbian, so you’ll\noccasionally hear pušćen and others."

          "text": "There’s usually a whole theory in textbooks about various types of so-called\nconditional sentences – sentences like if I..., I’d... (add your ideas here).\nActually, it’s quite simple. There are two types of such sentences: the first one is\nwhat could be (or could had been) but it’s not (e.g. if I were rich, I’d...). So it’s a kind\nof missed opportunity, a wish that’s not fulfilled, and you say why.\nIn such sentences in Croatian, what was not, but could have been, is expressed in\nconditional, and the reason (or obstacle) is expressed simply in the past tense or the\npresent tense, starting with the magic word da. Such clauses behave like normal\nclauses, perf. verbs cannot be used in the present tense. They simply refer to\nimagined actions or conditions that were necessary for the other part (in conditional)\nto happen. For example:\nDa je bilo toplo, otišli bismo na plažuA. If it had been warm, we\nwould have gone to the beach. (past)\nDa je toplo, otišli bismo na plažuA. If it were warm, we would go to\nthe beach. (present)\nThe Croatian sentences are simpler than English, since there’s no special usage of\ntenses. If some obstacle holds now, it’s expressed in the present tense. If it\nhappened in the past, the obstacle is in the past tense. The other part is in\nconditional.\nThere’s an exception to this pattern: if you express what could have happened with\nthe verb moći (...) can + another verb in infinitive, you should use just the past tense\ninstead of the conditional; it works for the past only:\nDa je bilo toplo, mogli smo otići na plažuA. If it had been warm, we\ncould have gone to the beach. (past)\nEnglish has also mixed conditional sentences, where the condition and unrealized\noutcome are in different tenses, e.g. if we had won the lottery, we would be rich.\nSince Croatian unrealized outcomes are in the conditional form, which doesn’t show\ntense, Croatian sentences really don’t tell when the outcome could have happened.\nYou can express a different moment with adverbs of time, e.g. the present moment\nwith sad(a) now:\nDa smo osvojili lutrijuA, sad bismo bili bogatiN. If we had won the lottery, we would\nbe rich. (past-present)\nAnother way to express ‘present’ (rather, present-indefinite future) unrealized\noutcomes is with kad(a). Now both parts are in conditional:\nKad bih imao puno novacaG, kupio bih dobar autoA. If I had a lot of money, I’d\nbuy a good car. (present)\n\nići\n1\n3f | nazvati\nFinally, recall that in colloquial speech and writing, conditional is usually expressed\nwith just bi² for all persons: you will mostly hear sad bi bili bogati instead of the\nformal sentence above, and so on (try Google™).\nThat much about such sentences.\nThe second type of conditional sentences is completely different. Now we simply\nsay what is going to happen if something gets fulfilled.\nIn English, such sentences look like if I get rich, I’ll... (add more ideas). They are\nsimilar to the first type since both use the word if. Not so in Croatian: first, another\nword is used – ako:\nAko je toplo, idemo na plažuA. If it’s warm, we go to the beach. (now, near\nfuture)\nAko bude toplo, ići ćemo na plažuA. If it’s warm, we’ll go to the beach. (future)\nAs you see, the structure is completely different now: the action is expressed in the\npresent or future tense, and the part after ako uses the same rules as near future or\nfuture sentences that use kad: bude instead of usual forms of the verb biti, the\npotential future tense (again not strictly respected in speech), etc.:"

          "type": "explanation",
          "text": "(future)\nActually, if you search the Internet, ako ćemo... is more common than ako\nbudemo... (or ako budem vs. ako ću, etc.). Try it yourself. Still, use of the common\nfuture tense after ako and kad is considered a mistake in formal writing.\nIn literature, you will sometimes find that in such clauses, instead of ako + forms of\n(bude), verb fronting + li² is used:\nBude li toplo, ići ćemo na plažuA.\nBudemo li igrali loše, sigurno ćemo izgubiti.\nThis is extremely rare in speech. There’s no difference in meaning; it’s mostly used\nwhen the verb (bude) is used.\nOf course, the conjunction ako holds the first position in the clause, and all second-\nposition words come right after it.\nAs you can see, ako-clauses are very similar to kad-clauses, but there’s more\nfreedom in ako-clauses: since the condition (if it’s warm) and the action (we’ll go to\nthe beach) are not necessarily close in time, the condition can be expressed in the\npast tense, and the action in any tense:\nAko se vratila, nazvat će meA. If she has come back, she’ll call me. (past, future)\nOf course, it’s possible to use imperative or even conditional in the main (action)\npart – everything, except the past tense:\nAko se vratila, odmah jeA nazovi. If she has come back, call her"

          "text": "3f A\nimmediately. (past, imperative)\nThere’s another type of sentences, not frequently discussed, kind of opposite of\nwhat I have just described. The reasons in the conditional sentences were important\n– they are precisely why something was not done or isn’t done. However, it’s easy to\nturn such sentences upside down: something happened (or didn’t) regardless of a\ncondition. This is what I mean:\nEven if it had been cold, we would have gone to the beach.\nIt wasn’t cold, but even if it were, the second part would happen, regardless of the\ncondition. In Croatian, surprisingly, you just add an i¨ before da and the whole\nsentence changes its meaning completely:\nI da je bilo hladno, otišli bismo na plažuA. Even if it had been cold,\nwe would have gone to the beach.\nAs usual, the word i¨ is ‘glued’ and it’s not counted: all second-position words come\nafter the da.\nAdding another word – čak – before i da further emphasizes irrelevance of the\ncondition. Such expression really translates as even if; only i da is more it doesn’t\nmatter:\nČak i da je bilo hladno, otišli bismo na plažuA. (emphasis)\nAnother option is that it was cold, but we still did it. The grammar is then of the\nsecond type (ako....). Then you would add i¨ to ako, but then they get fused to a\nsingle word iako:\nIako je bilo hladno, otišli smo na plažuA. Although it was cold, we\nwent to the beach.\nThe combined word iako is used like i da – only in the past and present tenses.

While English\nlanguage picture books can be about Mr. Bear, Mr. Tiger and so on, you will never\nsee it in Croatian: such books will be adapted as Big Bear, My Dear Tiger, etc. Even\nwhen adults talk to children about other adults, they won't usually use words like\ngospodin.\nChildren do use specific words addressing grown-ups outside of their family:\nTitles used by children\nteta\n'madam'\nstriček (NW, including Zagreb)\nbarba (coast, except Dubrovnik)\ndundo (Dubrovnik)\nčiko (A -u) (elsewhere)\nstriko (A -u) (elsewhere)\n'mister'\nThe words are the same as words for relatives in family, and words vary by region.\nChildren will usually use the title + first name, e.g. they will call their kindergarten\nteacher teta Ana; adults will refer to her in the same way, when talking to their\nchildren.\nMost familiar terms of relatives nowadays don't have special vocative forms and\nuse nominatives:\nmama Mom\ntata Dad\nteta aunt\nbaka grandmother\nThe following terms have vocative forms:\notac (oc-) father → oče\nmajka mother → majko\nFinally, it's custom to end a letter or mail message with one of:\nS poštovanjem,\nPozdrav,\nLijep pozdrav,\nFollowed by the full name (and function) of the sender. The line Lijep pozdrav is\ngetting increasingly common, and colloquially abbreviated as lp or LP."

          "text": "The English has a similar thing, but only colloquially: ‘on me’.\nAgain, in the accidental construction, what is broken is the subject (observe how the\npast form is in feminine).\nThe DL case is a common way to add who’s affected – always a person/animal or a\ngroup – to anything. Consider:\nGrijanjeN ne radi. The heating doesn’t work.\nThe sentence above lacks context: what heating. If it’s not working in your house,\nyou would add a possessive in English: our heating. It can be also done in Croatian,\nbut the preferred way in speech is to add DL:\nGrijanjeN namDL ne radi. Our heating doesn’t work. (lit. ‘doesn’t work to us’)\nAgain, if you know some Spanish, this will all be very familiar to you. This usage is so\ncommon that some people call it possessive dative.\nThe accidental construction is really just the ‘mediopassive’ – that is, using se² to\nexpress that we don’t know or don’t want to say who caused it – with a person in DL\nwho was somehow \"affected\" or \"involved\". This is an elegant way to say that what\nhas happened was not intention of that person.\nAs you hopefully remember, there’s another construction that uses the\n‘mediopassive’ and the DL case: the \"feel-like\". However, it’s easy to distinguish\nthem, since the \"feel-like\" uses impf. verbs (usually, but not always, related to\nfulfilling needs, like drink, eat, sleep, smoke). Taking the \"feel-like\" to the extreme,\nwe could say that somebody felt like breaking glasses, but there would be still a\ndifference:\n(1) Razbile su miDL se čašeN. The glasses have broken. (‘on me’)\n(2) Razbijale su miDL se čašeN. also: I felt like breaking glasses.\nYou can see clearly how the sentence #1 uses an perf. verb, while the sentence #2\nuses and impf. counterpart. However, the sentence #2 is ambiguous: it could also\nmean, depending on the context, that glasses were breaking (e.g. you worked in a\n\n2\n2pl\n1\nbar, and glasses were constantly breaking, but it was not your fault, the dishwasher\ndid it, etc.) This is really an extreme, stretched example, which would be very rare in\nreal life.\nSince persons/animals or groups added in DL are just affected by the event, this use\nof DL is also called dative of interest. Its use extends – mostly colloquially – to\nsentences where we want somebody to get interested, or when we just emphasize\nwho is/should be interested. So, in colloquial communication, among friends, it’s\ncommon to add the DL ti² to many sentences when you say something about\nyourself or someone else, similar to colloquial English you know:\nJaN tiDL sutra ne radim. I don’t work tomorrow. (you know)\nOf course, if you’re talking to a group, you would use another pronoun:\nJaN vamDL sutra ne radim.\nOn the other side, when you ask a question, the DL mi² is sometimes added to\nemphasize that you’re interested:\nKako si miDL? How are you doing? (I’d like to know)\nAll these DL’s to express interest are used only colloquially, among close friends and\nfamily.\nAnother way used in colloquial communication is literally the same as in English,\nadding znaš you know to the beginning:"

In writing, it’s\ncommon to use pored... i in this meaning as well.\nThe next thing is using da-clauses to express how something is done. Such clauses\nare then appended to tako so, in such way, so effectively we have tako da:\nOdgovorite na pitanjaA tako da zaokružite brojA ispred odgovoraG. Answer the\nquestions ‘in such a way that’ you circle the number before the answer. (i.e. by\ncircling a number)\nThere are two more constructions that use da-clauses. The first one corresponds to\nEnglish construction too... to..., for example:\nGoranN je premladN [da vozi autoA]. Goran is too young [to drive a car].\nWhile English has too as a separate word, Croatian pre- is glued to the adjective (you\nwill see it spelled separately from time to time, but it’s non-standard spelling).\nWhile English uses a to-construction, Croatian sentences are of the desire type, i.e.\nonly present tense (or conditional) but perfective verbs are allowed (one is used in\nthe example below). Note that the Croatian construction is much more flexible,\nsince anything can be a subject in the clause, while English is stuck with the infinitive,\nwhich cannot have a subject; therefore, English must use for when the subjects\ndiffer:\nSendvičN je prevelikN [da gaA pojedem]. The sandwich is too big [for me] [to\neat (it completely)].\nLiterally, the Croatian sentence says:\nThe sandwich is too big da I completely-eat it.\nIt’t interesting that in such sentences, conditional is used more often than the\npresent tense; sometimes you’ll see the verb moći (može +, mogao, mogla) can also\nadded to the clause, with not much difference in meaning:\nSendvičN je prevelikN [da bih gaA pojeo].\nSendvičN je prevelikN [da bih gaA mogao pojesti].\nAs with other atemporal clauses, instead of biti (je² +) be, the verb (bude) should be\nused, but conditional prevails with that verb almost completely in this construction.\nThis construction easily translates English phrases like too good to be true i.e.\npredobro da bi bilo istina – and similar – but they are not that common in Croatian\nand somehow always feel like translation of English phrases.\n\n3f\n3pl | moći pres-1\nAnother construction corresponds to English so... that... While the English\nconstruction looks quite different from the previous one, Croatian simply uses\ntako... da..., but the da-clause is of indicative-type (i.e. any tense, but no perfective\nverbs in present):\nKnjigaN je tako debelaN [da ću jeA čitati danimaI]. The book is so thick [that I’ll\nbe reading it for days].\nBesides tako so, you can use toliko so many (don’t forget it’s a quantity adverb,\ntherefore, uncountable nouns have to be in G after it, and countable ones in G-pl):\nVidim toliko vrabacaG [da ihA ne mogu izbrojati]. I see so many\nsparrows [that I can’t count them].\nSometimes toliko is used with adjectives, so you’ll encounter toliko skupa... da...\nand similar expressions:\nPizzaN je bila toliko ljutaN [da sam popio litruA vodeG]. The pizza was so hot [that I\ndrank a liter of water].\n(Croatian has one word for both angry and hot because of spices.) Besides these\nwords, you can see takav (takv-) such, usually before nouns (but it can be used on its\nown, since it’s an adjective):\nMaglaN je takva [da sviN voze polako]. The fog is ‘such’ [that everyone is driving\nslowly].\n(The last type, without a noun, must be slightly rephrased in English.)\nThis type of clause is sometimes called result clause; bear in mind that they require\ntwo things: a word like tako, toliko or takav (takv-) and an indicative da-clause.\nIn both English and Croatian, there’s also a third type, where the main verb is\nnegated; in English not... such... to...:\nNisam takav idiotN [da platim 1000 euraG za toA]. I’m not such an idiot [to pay 1000\neuros for that].\nNow the part after da is not going to happen, so both English and Croatian switch to\nan atemporal construction.

The chorus\ncontains a number of as if constructions. Note that the Croatian lyrics have\n\n1\n1\n1\nf\neverything in the present tense, but English have the subjunctive shift to the past:\nI kao [da meG nema tu]\nAnd as [if I weren’t here]\njaN tonem sve do dnaG\nI’m sinking all the way to the bottom\nI kao [da miDL nestaje\nAnd as [if\ntloN pod nogamaI]\nthe ground under my feet were disappearing]\nThe second verse has sve do¨, where sve doesn’t mean all, but all the way, i.e. it\nstrengthens the preposition do¨. The third and fourth verse are one sentence, the\nverb is in the third verse, and the pronoun mi² refers to noge feet/legs which is the\nsubject; the fourth verse also illustrates pod¨ + I. I guess the pronoun ja in the\nsecond verse is there just to add one syllable.\nThe rest of the chorus has a similar structure, again the DL mi² marks the possession\nof tijelo body. (You see again and again how DL is common with body parts.)\nI kao [da miDL tijeloN gori]\nAnd as [if my body were burning]\njaN zovem upomoć\nI’m calling for help\nA ponovo bi dala sveA\nAnd I’d give everything again\nza jednu jedinu noćA\nfor a single night\n(Ante Pecotić)\nThe word bi is, of course, just the colloquial form of bih, the 1st person of the\nconditional verb.

One of the main differences is that Split area consistently uses the Standard\nstress system, with all shifts, etc. while in Rijeka, the 'western' stress prevails.\nUse of Ikavian is very widespread in Split and surrounding areas in everyday\ncommunication. A lot of local musicians produce music with Ikavian words. There\nare even novels and newspaper columns written in Ikavian. There are movies and\n‘telenovelas’ with a lot of Ikavian forms. Since such songs and ‘telenovelas’ are quite\npopular in countries of former Yugoslavia, everyone understands a bit of Ikavian,\ndespite it having no official status anywhere. (There's a small population in Northern\nSerbia, called Bunjevci, which is – controversially – sometimes considered a separate\nethnic group in Serbia, and their language is Ikavian. They have primary schools in\nIkavian.)\nThe difference Ikavian vs. Standard Croatian is similar to e.g. difference between\nStandard Serbian and Standard Croatian. However, bear in mind that there are\ndialects in Croatia that much more divergent, to the point of being barely\nunderstandable, having specific sounds, case forms, and so on! They will be\ndescribed in A8 Dialects.\nFinally, Ikavian is far from homogeneous. What is spoken on islands would be very\ndifferent than what is spoken inland. Generally, on islands and smaller towns, you'll\nsee larger difference from the Standard and more specific forms.\nThere's one more difference that is completely independent of Ikavian, but some\nIkavian dialects, including Dalmatian hinterland, have it: loss of h. It was replaced by\neither v or j, depending on the surrounding sounds, or simply lost, e.g. in the\nbeginning of the word (I have listed only nominatives):\nStandard word\nh-less\nkruh bread\nkruv\nhladan adj. cold\nladan\nsnaha son's wife\nsnaja\nsuh adj. dry\nsuv\nToday, most people in Split – especially when they speak privately – don't have h in\nmost words. This produces, with other differences described above, e.g. past forms\ntija and tila, corresponding to Standard htio and htjela.\nThis loss also happened in large parts of Bosnia and whole Serbia (however,\nStandard Serbian has restored h at the beginning of words, so it's hladan and suv in\nStandard Serbian.)\nThere are also Ekavian dialects, where all changes are similar to ones described\nabove, but have e instead of i (lep, etc.). They prevail in Serbia, and the Standard\nSerbian in Serbia is Ekavian. You can find more about Ekavian in A9 Bosnian, Serbian\nand Montenegrin.\n\n2\n1\nf\nf\nf\n1\nThis overview of Ikavian was intentionally brief and light; there are whole books\nwritten about various dialects, mostly dictionaries of local speech for some town or\nregion. Unfortunately, little is available online.\nPlease don't think ‘Ikavian’ equals ‘Dalmatian’. For example, Dubrovnik is a city in\nDalmatia, but the dialect spoken there is very different from one spoken in Split, and\nby no means Ikavian.\n• Examples\nThere are so many popular Croatian songs in Ikavian, that it's hard to give just a few\nexamples!\nThis hit performed by Goran Karan – Lipa si, lipa – is not about a tree (Std. lipa lime\ntree, tilia), but about a woman (beautiful, of course).\nZa tobomI noćas\nFor you tonight"

Any song performed by them is worth listening;\ntheir works touch a wide range of themes, including love, everyday life, drugs, urban\ndecay, politics.\nThis is a kind of love song, Fantastična Fantastic (f) – about a friend who becomes a\ndrug addict and hallucinates having a girlfriend, literally a fantasy:\nMaraN nije ima mobitelA\nMara had no cellphone\n  nikad nije bia doma\n  he was never at home\nI onda jednog jutraA\nAnd then one morning\n  sam gaA srea isprid liftaG\n  I met him in front of the elevator\na MaraN je bia sritanN\nand Mara was happy\n  ka nikad\n  like never (before)\nI sta je pričat:\nAnd he started to talk:\n  upozna sam\n  I've met\n  ljubavA svog životaG\n  the love of my life\n  prije misecA danaG\n  a month ago\nKad sam se spustia\nWhen I went down\n  do dućanaG\n  to the store\nPo kruvA i mlikoA\nTo get bread and milk\n  u onoj plastičnoj bociDL\n  in that plastic bottle\nNa blagajniDL ugleda te očiA\nI saw those eyes at the checkout\n(Aleksandar Antić)\nOne form is worth explaining: in parts of Dalmatia, the verb stati (stane) perf. come\nto stand also means start, begin.\nThe language in their songs is how younger people in Split actually speak, there is a\nlot of influence from Standard Croatian (here srea instead of Ikavian sria, prije\ninstead of Ikavian pri, later you can hear tjedan week, a word which is traditionally\nnot used in Dalmatia, etc.), a lot of local slang, words offensive to some (older\npeople) etc. Check the live performance on YouTube™.\n\n1\n1"

This phrase is often used in negative, clearing\nsomeone of responsibility, often additionally expressing someone’s claim is wrong,\nthat it’s actually the responsibility of the one who claims!

          "text": "Croatian often uses patterns of verb derivation where meanings are derived by\nsimply adding prefixes. For instance, let’s take the following verb pair:\npadati ~ pasti (padne, pao) fall\nFrom it, you can derive e.g. the following verb pairs with specific meanings:\nispadati ~ ispasti (ispadne, ispao) fall out\nraspadati ~ raspasti (raspadne, raspao) se² fall apart\nupadati ~ upasti (upadne, upao) fall into\nAll such pairs are of the same kind like the base pair: there’s a process (involving a\nkind of ‘falling’ that can be completed). But what about if we add pri- to the base\npair:\npripadati ~ pripasti (pripadne, pripao) ?\nThe verb pripadati of course means belong, but what should the perfective verb\nmean? Belonging is a state; how can you complete it?\nIt turns out that the perfective verb is used, but in the meaning begin to belong, start\nto belong. For verbs that indicate lasting states, associated perfective verbs often\nmean entering the state.\nSuch verbs are often hard to translate into English. The verb pripasti (...) will be\nusually translated as given, assigned and so on, or the sentence would be rephrased.\nSuch perfective verbs that don’t mean completion or accomplishment are\nsometimes called inchoative verbs (abbreviated as inch.).\nTo emphasize that the perfective verb has not the usual meaning of ‘completion’, but\n‘getting into a state’, I'll use a double tilde (~~). The prefix za- is often used to make\nsuch verbs:\nmrziti ~~ za- («) hate ®\npamtiti ~~ za- memorize\nvoljeti (voli, volio, voljela) ~~ za- («) love/like\nFor example:"

Goran quickly fell asleep.\n(Historically, the pair meaning sleep was also derived with just za-; however, the\nverb spati (spi) sleep is now archaic in most of Croatia; it has been replaced by a\nmore regular spavati, but the older verb is still used in some dialects.)\nMany inchoative verbs can be rephrased using phase verbs, e.g.:"

For such verbs, I will list both perfective verbs:\nperfective\nimpf.\n↓\ndone\n↓\nbegin\n↓\nplivati ~ ot- ~ za- swim\nSuch groups of verbs can be called aspect triplets. Such common triplets are:\nigrati ~ od- («) ~ za- («) play (game)\npjevati ~ ot- ~ za- sing\nsvirati ~ od- («) ~ za- («) play (music)\nAs you can see, the stress behaves the same in both perf. verbs. It really depends on\nthe base verb.\n(Some textbooks use the term inchoative only for verbs which mean entering a\nstate, and call the start-of-action verbs ingressive. I’ll use one name for both kinds.)\nWhile English often uses get + adjective to express entering a state, Croatian has\n\nspecific verbs:\nogladniti («) perf. get hungry\nozdraviti perf. recover, get healthy\nrazboljeti (razboli, ...) se² perf. get sick\nFor some meanings, you can either make someone something, or get something; the\nsecond meaning requires a se² in Croatian, i.e. it’s another example of mediopassive\nse², when the subject changes ‘on its own’:\nperf. verb\n+ A\n+ se²"

Such verbs sometimes\ndon’t have impf. pairs at all.\nFor some meanings in Croatian, there’s a full verb pair that indicates getting into a\nstate; the impf. verb sees entering a state as a process (e.g. it can take a while to\nbecome sick, it can take a while to get old, etc.):\npokretati (pokreće) ~ pokrenuti (pokrene) get moving\nstarjeti/stariti ~ o- grow/get old\nTherefore, there are verb triplets with two verbs for entering the state: one impf.\nand another perf. A parallel in English would be:\nI was getting hungry. = enter-impf.\nI got hungry. = enter-perf.\nI am hungry. = state (impf.)\nThere are three such triplets for body position verbs, one of them I’ve introduced in\n52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease; we can also list verbs be and become as a kind of\ntriplet:\n\nenter-impf.\nenter-perf.\nstate (impf.)\nlie\nlijegati\n(liježe)\nleći\n(legne, legao, legla)\nležati\n(leži)\nsit\nsjedati\nsjesti\n(sjedne, sjeo)\nsjediti\nstand\nstajati\n(staje)\nstati\n(stane)\nstajati\n(stoji)\nbe\npostajati\n(postaje)\npostati\n(postane)\nbiti\n(je² +)\nIt’s interesting how all verbs in the last row can have same arguments, i.e. nouns or\nadjectives in N:\nGoranN postaje gladanN. Goran is getting hungry.\nGoranN je postao gladanN. Goran got hungry.\nGoranN je gladanN. Goran is hungry.\nIf we look further, we can find more inchoative triplets, for example:\nenter-impf.\nenter-perf.\nstate (impf.)\nučiti\nlearn, study\nnaučiti («)\nlearn\nznati\nknow\ndoznavati (doznaje)\nfind out,\nget to know\ndoznati\nfind out,\nget to know\nupoznavati (upoznaje)\nget acquainted with\nupoznati\nget acq. with\npoznavati (poznaje)\nknow (person, city),\nbe acquainted with\nThe pair doznavati (doznaje) ~ doznati is for simple facts, with little effort, while\nučiti ~ na- («) is for complex topics (driving a car, Croatian, calculus, etc.). The last\ntriplet is mostly for ‘knowing’ people and cities.\nThere is one more type of perfective verbs, where action consists of bits – one\nexample is sneezing: it’s a sequence of individual sneezes.

I will classify them as kind-of semelfactive, with the\nsame mark (~¹), but you should be aware of the small difference. Three most\ncommon pairs like that are:\nmisliti ~¹ po- think"

          "text": "osjećati ~¹ osjetiti feel\nThe perf. verbs above mean think for a short time and hope for a short time, or have\na thought. They are often used in negative, to emphasize that somebody didn’t think\neven for a moment.\nDon’t forget that there’s a substantial difference in meaning between verbs like\nzavoljeti (...) and pomisliti. The former verbs indicate entering a state which can last\nany amount of time – we don’t say how long, and if we want to express when the\nstate ended, we have to use another verb. The latter ones are ‘atomic’, or small\n‘pulses’, indicating that action or state lasted for a small amount of time:\n‘inchoative’\n(start-of-state)\n‘semelfactive’\n(atomic / brief)\nzaspati (zaspi)\n  fall asleep\nzavoljeti (zavoli,...)\n  start to love\nkihnuti (kihne)\n  sneeze (once)\npomisliti\n  think for a moment\nHowever, there are perf. verbs where the two meanings are mixed. Two common\nones are:\nzaželjeti (zaželi,...)\npoželjeti (poželi,...)\n   ‘perf.’ wish\nFrom what I’ve explained above, you would expect that poželjeti (...) means wish for\na moment, and that zaželjeti (...) start to wish, but it’s not so – both have meaning\n\nsomewhere in between, and are used interchangeably.\nThere are also secondary, ‘iterative’ impf. verbs derived from semelfactive verbs. For\nexample:\npomisliti smlf. think for a moment → pomišljati («)\nThe relation of these two verbs is like kihnuti (...) vs. kihati (...) – the impf. verb\nstands for a series of individual short thoughts, with unspecified time between the\nthoughts (it could be hours, or days, or weeks, or more):\nmisliti impf. think\npomisliti smlf. think for a moment, once\npomišljati («) impf. think once a while\nAll three verbs are sometimes translated as think, which unfortunately hides various\nshades of meaning.\nFinally, there are verb pairs that can be understood either as normal impf.-perf.\npairs, or as iterative-semelfactive, depending on the context. Common pairs are:\nbacati ~/~¹ baciti throw\npokazivati (-uje «) ~/~¹ pokazati (pokaže) show\nIn fact, most perf. verbs also can be used in this way, for short events, while most\nimpf. verbs can be also used for series of short events."

Therefore, the past\nforms and pres-1 were and still are fully regular (mog-la, mog-u). (I’m here\nsimplifying things a bit: in the distant past, the past and present endings were a bit\ndifferent; also, the o in mog- wasn’t really an o.)\nBut then, for unknown reasons, sequences kti and gti changed their pronunciations\ninto ći (the sound wasn’t of today ć, but an early version of it, a kind of softened t).\n\n1\n1\n(\ny\ny\n)\nLater, short i’s were dropped from ends of words (as from most other positions as\nwell). So, we are now left with t vs. ć.\nAlso, note the similarity of mog-tī with English may, might and German mögen, mag.\nIf we would go back in time, we would find many more similarities.\n• Examples\nThere’s a song from Massimo, a Croatian pop singer — Tišina Silence:\nDo tebeG meA nosi tišinaN\nTo you silence is carrying me\nNa krilimaDL vremenaG\nOn wings of time\nMjestaG još uvijek ima\nThere’s still some room\n\n\nKad zastanem pitat ću zvijezdeA\nWhen I stop, I’ll ask stars\nKoliko meA dijeli do tebeG\nHow far I’m from you\nI tvojih visinaG\nAnd your heights\n(S.

Those words are often\napplied to babies, children, and parts of them, and therefore stand for ‘cute’ and\n‘dear’ things as well.\nFor instance, in Croatian you can say that a baby has a glava head, but people prefer\nto call it glavica little head. Such words are called diminutives and usually have a\ndifferent emotional content.\nDiminutives are words that are derived through a process that’s only partially\nregular. Not all nouns have a diminutive, and there are various endings to derive\nthem – they are like relational adjectives in that manner.\nFor nouns ending in -a, the main way to form diminutives is by replacing -a with -ica.\nThe result is another noun, again ending in -a:\nglava head → glavica\nkrava cow → kravica"

Again, for babies and small children, people prefer to call their body\nparts prstić, nosić and so on.\nFor a few words (there’s no rule, as far as I can tell) -čić is added instead:\nkamen stone → kamenčić\nprozor window → prozorčić\nFor some nouns, consonants are shifted before -ić or -čić (e.g. c, k → č, h → š etc.):\nlanac (lanc-) chain → lančić\nkrug circle → kružić\nrak crab → račić\nzec rabbit, bunny → zečić\nThe word lančić is always used for fine chains worn around the neck, while lanac is a\nheavy thing used to close gates, to lift loads etc.\nLike for feminine nouns, certain diminutives have developed specific meanings:\nbrat brother → bratić cousin\nnovac (novc-) money → novčić coin\nHistorically, bratić meant something like ‘brother’s small (boy)’, and this was\nextended to name people after their fathers by diminutives:\nIvo → Ivić\nJure → Jurić\nMate → Matić\nTomo → Tomić\nThese were later used as last names – so you now understand why there are so\nmany last names in Croatia and neighboring countries ending in -ić.\nSometimes, you’ll see diminutives from neuter nouns, derived with -ce, with many\nirregularities:\ndrvo tree → drvce\njezero lake → jezerce\nsunce sun → sunašce\n\nIt’s interesting that the very word sunce is likely originally a diminutive as well.\nHowever, in Kajkavian areas – generally the area around Zagreb, and north and\nnortheast from Zagreb – another suffix to create masculine and neuter diminutives\nprevails: -ek (-eko for neuters). Since Zagreb is Kajkavian-influenced, you will find\nsuch words in Zagreb as well, usually:\nmedo teddy bear → medek\nsrce heart → srčeko\n   (NW Croatia)\nThese words are common when people talk to small children. In NW Croatia,\ndiminutives are generallly much more used than in other regions of Croatia: people\nwill tell children to eat juhica and meseko which basically has no meaning except to\nsweeten the words juha soup and meso meat.\nSimilar to diminutives, but distinct, are hypocorisms, also known as pet names or\nnicknames. They are alternative words for things and people used within family,\nespecially by children. One hypocorism is already mentioned above: medo for the\nusual medvjed bear.\nWords mama Mom and tata m Dad are also, historically, a kind of hypocorisms.\nHypocorisms for personal names are mostly fixed in language; as in English, they\nusually involve shortening of names (in Croatian, to two syllables) and simplifying\nthem:\nBranimir → Branko\nIvan → Ivo / Ive\nJuraj → Jure / Jura\nKatarina → Kata\nPetar (Petr-) → Pero ®\nTomislav → Tomo ®\nVladimir → Vlado ®\nZvonimir → Zvonko / Zvone\nSome nicknames have two forms; ones with -e are characteristic for Dalmatia, while\nones with -o or -a are characteristic for inland Croatia. In Kajkavian regions, you\nwould also hear forms ending in -ek:\nIvan → Ivek (NW Croatia)\nCompare this to English names William → Bill or Robert → Bob. Many such nickames\nare used as real names as well.\nDiminutive-making mechanism is also applied to names and nicknames that end in -a\nor behave so, to make diminutive names:\nBranka → Brankica\nKata → Katica\nRuža → Ružica\nIvo → Ivica m\nJure → Jurica m\nPero → Perica m\nThis is similar to English Bill → Billy, Rose → Rosie and Bob → Bobby.\nInterestingly, a couple of verbs in Croatian have diminutive versions too! They are\nusually formed by inserting -k- before the verb ending. The process is not regular,\n\nand only a limited number of verbs have diminutives:"

          "text": "I’ll explain several useful verbs and verb families here, and also introduce a couple of\nadvanced topics.\nThe first verb family is derived in this pattern:\ntvoriti\no-tvarati («) ~ o-tvoriti («)\nThe base verb, tvoriti, is quite rare. The derived pairs are not:\nprefix\nused with\nmeaning\no-\nA\nopen\npri-\nA\nleave ajar (‘almost close’)\nza-\nA\nclose\npre-\nA (u¨ A)\ntransform\ns-\nA\ncreate\nse²\nshow up (colloq.)\nThere’s not much to say about the first three verbs: they express open and close –\neither literal (window, shop), or metaphoric (discussion, person).\nThe last two verbs have specific meanings. The pre- verb is similar to transport verbs\nderived by pre-: it uses destinations (expressed by u¨ + A) and optionally also origins\n(expressed by iz¨ + G, matching the destination). The verb is used with either an\nobject in A, or a se² (mediopassively, if something transforms ‘on its own’):\nMali problemN se pretvorio u velikiA. A small problem has transformed into a big\none.\nThe verb pair otvarati («) ~ otvoriti («) open can illustrate a fine point when\nperfective verbs are used and where not. If you opened a window, and then closed\nit – and it’s a bit cold now in the room – and you want to express with a single verb\nwhat you did, you would use the imperfective verb:\nOtvarao sam prozorA. I opened the window. (It’s maybe closed now.)\nIf you use the impf. verb, it doesn’t imply that the window is open now, or that it\nremained open for some time – but such things would be implied if you would use\nthe perf. verb:\nOtvorio sam prozorA. I’ve opened the window. (And it’s open now.)\nThis is the ‘standing outcome’ principle. This is because perf. verbs focus on the\noutcome, but the outcome – state of the window – is not relevant here (or not\nexpected). It’s important that you touched it. An obvious way to say it’s not open\n\n3m/n\n3m/n\nanymore is this:\nOtvorio sam prozorA i poslije gaA zatvorio. I’ve opened the window and\nclosed it later.\nSo, the second verb ‘undoes’ the first. It’s actually more general: only the last\nperfective verb in the sequence counts. That is, if you say:"
        },
        {
          "type": "explanation",
          "text": "It would imply only it’s washed now, not whether it’s open or closed. This is a very\nsubtle, but important principle: only the last outcome in a sequence ‘stands’. We\ncould paraphrase it as the last outcome standing! This likely sounds extremely\ncomplicated, but an example will make it (hopefully) clear (‘standing outcomes’ are\nin red):\nexample\nimplies\nIšla sam u trgovinuA.\nI was going/went to the shop.\nimperfective!\nno implications whatsoever\nOtišla sam u trgovinuA.\nI have gone to the shop.\n(I’m in the shop)\nOtišla sam u trgovinuA i kupila pivoA.\nI went to the shop and bought beer.\n(I have some beer)\nOtišla sam u trgovinuA, kupila pivoA i popila gaA.\nI went to the shop, bought beer and drank it.\n(no beer; I might be drunk)\nPala sam.\nI fell.\ninvoluntary event!\nno implications\nHowever, the ‘standing outcome’ doesn’t apply to all perf. verbs – only to voluntary\nones. Check the last row: pala sam doesn’t imply I’m still on the floor: it’s not\nsomething I did voluntary. It just happened.\nNote that the impf. verb doesn’t really say we got to the shop at all. It just says we\nwere going there, there was some action. But if we don’t say there were some\nproblems on the way there, it’s enough. So the default, shortest way of saying\nsomething with a ‘standing outcome’ – if the ‘standing outcome’ doesn’t hold\nanymore – would be actually using the impf. verb.\nTherefore, perf. involuntary verbs are used much more often than voluntary ones.\nIn real life, this rule is not completely clear-cut: you will hear both just išla sam u\ntrgovinu and otišla sam u trgovinu for completed actions in the past and for\nspeaker being obviously not in the shop anyomore.\nThe important thing is that you will hear impf. verbs where you would naively – due\nto completion – expect perf. ones. Always keep in mind that perf. verbs are not just\n\nabout completed actions, but also about the outcomes, especially for voluntary\nactions – and the outcome of going somewhere is being there.\nThere’s another way to distance yourself from a past action expressed by a\nvoluntary perfective verb – by using another tense, not yet described: the so-called\nplusquamperfect tense (in English, the name is often simplified to pluperfect tense).\nIt roughly corresponds to he had opened and like.\nThe tense is formed like the common past tense, but there’s an extra past form of\nthe verb biti (je² +), in the same gender and number as the other past form:\nGledala sam filmA. I was watching the movie. (fem. speaking)\nBila sam gledala filmA. (pluperfect)\nYou can visualize it as putting the verb in the past twice:\npresent\ngledam I’m watching\n  ↓\n  ...put the verb gledati into the past\npast\ngledala sam I was watching\n  ↓\n  ...put the verb biti (je² +) into the past\npluperfect\nbila sam gledala I had been watching\nUsing this tense, we can put a distance from the action – there’s no ‘standing\noutcome’:\nBio sam otvorio prozorA. I had opened the window. (But it was maybe closed later.)\nIt also serves to emphasize actions and states, like I was really doing it, I really did it,\nit has really happened:"

There are actually even more\ntenses you’ll see sometimes in writing; they will be described in 99 Aorist Tense and\nOther Marginal Features.\nLet’s go back to verbs. The next family is weird – there’s no base verb (or pair) – all\nverbs have prefixes.

The last noun is a\nproper noun, i.e. a name (e.g. California), and a common noun before it describes its\ntitle (e.g. king) or kind (e.g. hotel).\nCroatian uses such expressions more often than English, e.g. in names of rivers,\nlakes, cities and countries:\nrijeka Sava the Sava river (lit. ‘river Sava’)\njezero Jarun the Jarun lake (lit. ‘lake Jarun’)\nGrad Zagreb the City of Zagreb (lit. ‘City Zagreb’)\nRepublika Hrvatska the Republic of Croatia\nNow, in some of these expressions, both nouns change case, and in others, the last\nword (the name) is ‘frozen’ in N.\nIf nouns stand for a person (or an animal, as Croatian almost always treats humans\nas a kind of animal), both nouns always change (examples show the accusative\ncase):\n\nmoj prijatelj Igor my friend Igor → mog prijatelja Igora\nteta Ana aunt Ana → tetu Anu ®\nThis also applies to the following nouns:\ngrad city\nrijeka river\nFor example (u¨ + DL):\ngrad Rijeka the City of Rijeka → u gradu Rijeci\ngrad Split the City of Split → u gradu Splitu\nrijeka Drava the Drava river → u rijeci Dravi\nSince a great majority of rivers have feminine names in Croatian, use of rijeka river\nwith masculine names of rivers is avoided. (Croatian so strongly prefers feminine\nriver names, that even names like the Thames and the Rhine are adapted as\nfeminine Temza and Rajna). You will mostly see ‘frozen’ masc. names of rivers, e.g.\nu rijeci Dunav:\nrijeka Dunav the Danube river → (?) u rijeci Dunavu\nAfter most other nouns, only feminine names can change, but it’s optional – names\nare usually not changed.

You don't\nneed them in everyday life, but some people use them, and you'll see them in\nliterature (but they are rare even in books).\nFirst, there are several rarely used verb tenses.\nThe aorist tense is traditionally a past tense, but today it's usually used for events\nthat have happened moments ago, or are about to happen right now. It's usually\nformed for perfective verbs, but it can be used with impf. verbs as well.\nThe aorist tense is a single word, usually formed from the infinitive. For verbs ending\nin -ti, the ending is replaced with the following personal endings:\nperson\nsing.\nplur.\n1st\n-h\n-smo\n2nd\n-\n-ste\n3rd\n-\n-še\nI'll use abbreviations like aor-1, aor-3pl for various aorist forms, in the same way as\nfor the present tense forms. Here are forms for several verbs (pres-3 and past forms\nare not shown, as they're not important for forming the aorist if verbs have -ti in\ninf):\nnaučiti perf. learn → aor-1 naučih\npozvati perf. call, invite → aor-1 pozvah\nuzeti perf. take → aor-1 uzeh"

So far, I've explained only so-called definite adjectives, which\nare usually used.\nHowever, most adjectives also had indefinite forms. They could have different stress\nand case endings.

They should be used\nwith indefinite nouns, i.e. when you would use the indefinite article in English:\nVidim crna konja. A see a black horse. (very rare in use)\nThen, some adjectives, according to Standard Croatian, have only indefinite forms,\nregardless of definiteness, and that includes all possessives in -ov or -ev, including\nnjegov his:\n\nVidim njegova brata. I see his brother. (Standard, but very rare)\nVidim njegovog brata. (this is almost always used)\nHowever, you'll see forms like above in some newspapers, on TV news, and in\npoetry.\nThen, Standard Croatian insists that numbers 2-4 change according to case. You will\nsometimes see in writing DLI forms for numbers 2 and both in feminine gender and\nfor 3:\nnumber\nDLI\nobje f both\nobjema\ndvije f two\ndvjema\ntri three\ntrima\nIf numbers change, nouns also change, into DLI-pl.

Another very important form is the 3rd\npers. present singular (pres-3), the form to derive all other present forms from\n(except for three irregular verbs).\nBased on their endings in infinitive and pres-3, verb are divided into verb classes.\nVarious textbooks use different divisions. The division presented here is useful for\nsomeone learning Croatian as a foreign language.\nPresent tense forms\nAll forms of the present tense have always the same endings (except for three\nirregular verbs) – only the pres-3pl depends on the vowel pres-3 ends in:\npres-1\n-a-m\n-i-m\n-e-m\npres-2\n-a-š\n-i-š\n-e-š\npres-3\n-a\n-i\n-e\npres-1pl\n-a-mo\n-i-mo\n-e-mo\npres-2pl\n-a-te\n-i-te\n-e-te\npres-3pl\n-aju\n-e\n-u\nTwo verbs have (fully regular) present forms only:\n(bude) perf. be, get, become\n(veli) say\nWhile (bude) is one of most important verbs in Croatian, the verb (veli) is often used\nonly in certain regions.\nAorist forms\nThe aorist tense is not frequently used. It's a past tense, sometimes used for events\nthat are about to happen right now. Usually it's formed for perfective verbs, but it\ncan be used with imperfective verbs as well. Its forms are:\naor-1\n-h\n-o-h\naor-23\n-\n-e\naor-1pl\n-smo\n-o-smo\naor-2pl\n-ste\n-o-ste\naor-3pl\n-še\n-o-še\n\nThe endings with a vowel (-o-h, etc.) are used only with verbs that have infinitives\nending in -sti or -ći. For all other verbs, the aorist forms are simply formed from the\ninfinitive by discarding -ti and adding aorist endings:\ninf\naor-1\nnaučiti perf. learn\nnaučih\nuzeti perf. take\nuzeh\npojesti perf. eat\npojedoh\nFor more information about forming the aorist tense for verbs in -sti or -ći, check\nWith possible sound shifts in infinitive and present below.\nSimple verb classes\nThese are the easiest verb classes:\n  inf\npres-3\npast-m\na\n-a-ti\n-a\n-a-o\ni\n-i-ti\n-i\n-i-o\nn\n-nu-ti\n-n-e\n-nu-o\nova/uje\n-ova-ti\n-uj-e\n-ova-o\nTwo out of four classes are completely determined by their infinitive form: all verbs\nwith infinitives in -nuti belong to the n-verbs, and all verbs with infinitives in -ovati\nbelong to ova/uje-verbs.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't hold for verbs ending in -ati or -iti: they are not all a-verbs\nor i-verbs.\nA great majority of verbs belong to these four verb classes. Past forms are simply\nobtained from the infinitive. Unprefixed a-verbs are more or less all imperfective, as\nalmost all ova/uje-verbs. Virtually all n-verbs are perfective, except for the following\nverbs:\n\nThe a-verbs are the default class of verbs: all new verbs that are adapted into\nCroatian (mostly colloquially) are adapted as a-verbs:\n\n(It seems that in Serbia ova/uje is the default verb class.)\nUnpredictable classes, without shifts\nA bit more difficult classes are unpredictable, without sound shifts. You basically\nhave to remember both infinitive and pres-3 form; however, there are no sound\nshifts. There are 7 classes in this group, divided into 2 subgroups. The first four are:\n  inf\npres-3\npast-m\nava/aje\n-ava-ti\n-aj-e\n-ava-o\neva/uje\n-eva-ti\n-uj-e\n-eva-o\niva/uje\n-iva-ti\n-uj-e\n-iva-o\nuva/uje\n-uva-ti\n-uj-e\n-uva-o\nThey all have -ati in the infinitive and are overall similar to a-verbs, except for the\npresent forms. Three classes (ava/aje, eva/uje, uva/uje) out of the 4 above contain\nonly a handful of of verbs. Common ones are:\n\n-znavati (-znaje)\n\nAll verbs listed are imperfective. Of course, verbs derived by prefixing those listed\nabove belong to the same class, but some are perfective. Often used are ones\nderived from davati (daje), e.g. do-davati (do-daje). The \"verb\" -znavati (-znaje) is\nnot used on its own, only verbs derived from it by prefixing are used, e.g. po-znavati\n(po-znaje).\nUnfortunately, verbs ending in -ivati can be either a-verbs – e.g. plivati, pozivati – or\niva/uje-verbs – e.g. dokazivati (dokazuje), etc. There are many iva/uje-verbs – too\nmuch to list here.\nThe next three classes are a bit more complicated, as two of them have a\n(predictable) alternation in the past forms. It's interesting that for some of them,\nStandard forms are different from forms used in speech and casual writing most of\nthe time:\n  inf\npres-3\npast-m\npast-f\na/i\n-a-ti\n-i\n-a-o\n-a-la\nje/i\n-je-ti\n-i\n-i-o\n-je-la\nje/ije\n-je-ti\n-ij-e\n-i-o\n-je-la\n\nOnly a limited number of verbs belong to the a/i-verbs. Some of them have general,\nquite basic meanings:\n\n-stojati\n\n(Only infinitives are listed, pres-3 forms end in -i!) The verb stajati (stoji) stand is\nirregular. This does not apply to verb derived from it, which have regular forms from\n-stojati. The verb spati (spi) sleep is quite archaic, but still used in some regions\n(however, verbs derived from it are common). Besides it, all a/i-verb feature\nCroatian-specific consonants.\nThe rest of a/i-verbs in common use stand for various sounds (again, I list only\ninfinitives):\n\nAll a/i-verbs listed here are imperfective, and verbs derived from by prefixing are\nalso a/i-verbs, but perfective, e.g. dotrčati (dotrči), zaspati (zaspi)...\nAs a rule, a/i-verbs have the stress fixed on the first syllable in the present tense, i.e.\nthe stress doesn't shift to negation in the standard stress scheme:\n\n. . .\n\n. . .\nThe only exception is the verb spati (spi) sleep.\nFour a/i-verbs above are marked with an asterisk (*). They also exist as plain i-verbs,\nin fact, Standard Croatian insists on them being just plain i-verbs, although a/i\nversions prevail in use:\n\nmostly used\nStd. Cro.\nbojati (boji)\nbojiti\nbrojati (broji)\nbrojiti\n\nzujati (zuji)\nzujiti\n(Google™ search of the .hr domain will show you the a/i-verb forms of these four\nverbs are 3-4 times more common than the i-verb forms.)\nAll verbs that end in infinitive in -jeti belong to the je/i-verbs, except for the\nfollowing common verbs, which belong to the je/ije-verbs:\ndospjeti (dospije, dospio, dospjela) perf. end up\n\nuspjeti (uspije, uspio, uspjela) perf. succeed\nHowever, many verbs that in Standard Croatian belong to the je/i-verbs are\nreshaped as plain i-verbs in colloquial communication, even in newspapers. This\ndoes not affect their present forms, only the infinitive and past forms. The following\nverbs are seldom seen with -je- in infinitive and past, -i- forms prevail even in\nnewspapers (only infinitives are listed for sake of brevity, you can work out other\nforms):\n\n(For example, Google™ gives 1250 hits for hlapiti on the .hr domain, but just 87 for\nhlapjeti.) Therefore, don't be surprised that Standard Croatian dictionaries list only\nforms starjeti, starjeli, but you hear are read just stariti and starili all the time. Of\ncourse, this applies to all verbs derived by prefixing from the verbs above, e.g.\ninstead of ostarjeti you will mostly see just ostariti.\nFor the following common verbs, i-forms prevail in casual communication, while\nje/i-forms prevail in written communication, newspapers, etc. (again, only infinitives\nare listed):\n\nWith a possible sound shift in present\n\nThis is a class (or two classes, if you like it) that contains a lot of verbs. Its\ncharacteristic is -ati in the infinitive, and e in the pres-3, with a possible sound shift.\nThe shift does not happen if the consonants before -ati are Croatian-specific\n(usually j) or r:\n  inf\npres-3\npast-m\na/*e\n-ja-ti\n-j-e\n-ja-o\n-sa-ti\netc.\n-š-e\netc.\n-sa-o\netc.\nCommon verbs that fall into this class without a sound shift are:\n\nThere are many common verbs with a sound shift. Here are verbs with the shift k or\nc → č, e.g. skakati (skače) – only infinitives are listed for brevity:\n\n-ricati\n\nThe following verbs have change h or s → š, e.g. pisati (piše):\n\nThe following verbs have change g or z → ž, e.g. rezati (reže):\n\n(to be expanded)\nVowel-root\nThis class is the simplest one historically, there's just -ti in infinitive and -je in pres-3:\n  inf\npres-3\npast-m\nvowel-root\n-ti\n-j-e\n-o\nOnly a limited number of verbs fall into this class:\n\nThe verb biti (bije) is rare in Croatia nowadays, but verbs derived from it – e.g. ubiti\n(ubije) perf. kill – are common. The same holds for viti (vije). One more verb – šiti\n(šije) – is archaic, šivati is much more frequent in meaning sew – but verbs derived\nfrom it are not.\nAdditionally, two perfective verbs also fall into this class:\nobuti (obuje) perf. put on (shoes)\numiti (umije) perf. wash (face)\nWith possible sound shifts in infinitive and present\nThis set of classes is basically the same as vowel-root, but they historically didn't\nhave a vowel before -ti in infinitive, so all kinds of sound assimilations happened in\nthe infinitive as well as in the present! Verbs belonging to this class often have\ndifferent consonants in all three main forms (infinitive, present, past). Most verbs in\nthis group have -ao in past-m.\nIt's possible to group verbs based on their (historic) final consonants. Following\nclasses don't have major alternations; they characteristically have -sti in the\ninfinitive, and their historic final consonant is revealed in present forms:\n  inf\npres-3\npast-m\npast-f\ns-root\n-s-ti\n-s-e\n-s-a-o\n-s-la\nst-root\n-s-ti\n-st-e\n-st-a-o\n-s-la\nb-root\n-ps-ti\n-b-e\n-b-a-o\n-b-la\nz-root\n-s-ti\n-z-e\n-z-a-o\n-z-la\nd/t-root\n-s-ti\n-d-e\n-o\n-la\n-s-ti\n-t-e\n-o\n-la\n\nExcept for d/t-root verbs, only a handful of verbs fall into these classes. They are:\n\n-vesti (-veze, -vezao, -vezla)\nThe second -vesti (etc.) is a base many verbs are derived from, with the basic\nmeaning drive, e.g. odvesti (etc.) drive away. The verb grepsti (etc.) is rare, more\ncommon is variant grebati (grebe). Of course, verbs are derived from the other\nverbs listed above too, e.g. odrasti (etc.).\nThe following verbs belong to the d/t-root verbs:\n\n-vesti (-vede, -veo, -vela)\n\nAgain, many verbs are derived from them, and the base -vesti (etc.) is used only to\nderive verbs from, with the basic meaning lead.\nThe following class has major alternations:\n  inf\npres-3\npast-m\npast-f\nk/g-root\n-ći\n-č-e\n-k-a-o\n-k-la\nThis class is called k/g-root for historical reasons – there are no g-root verbs in\ncommon use today. All alternations in various forms are shown here, with vući pull\nas an example (again, the original k is seen in past-m and pres-3pl):\n\ninf\nvu-ći\npres-3\nvu-če\npres-3pl\nvu-ku\npast-m\nvu-kao\npast-f\nvu-kla\nimper-2\nvu-ci\npass. adj.\nvu-čen\nSuch verbs are (only infinitives are listed for brevity):\nobući perf. wear (clothes)\n\nreći perf. say\n\nOf course, there are also verbs derived from them. The verb sjeći has ije instead of\nje in present forms.\nVerbs in all these classes, from s-root to k/g-root have a rightward stress shift in the\npresent tense (in the Standard scheme) if they have at least three syllables:\nodrasti (odraste)\nispeći (ispeče)\nobući (obuče)\nAll these classes have the aor-1 in -oh, with their historic final consonants:\n  inf\n\naor-1\nd/t-root\npojesti\npres-3 pojede\npojed-oh\nk/g-root\nreći\npast-m rekao\nrek-oh\nIn aor-23, the consonant before the ending -e changes like in pres forms:\nrekoh aor-1 → reče aor-23\nWith vowel alternation\nThese classes have their pres-3 different from inf/past not by change of consonants,\nbut vowels. They are further divided into three subclasses. The first one has\ninfinitive on -ati; it contains the following common verbs:\n\nsrati (sere) shit (impolite!)\n\nAll these verbs are imperfective, verbs derived from them by prefixing are all\n\nperfective; both have have pass. adj. ending in -an (e.g. pozvan invited).\nThe next class has infinitives in -eti and -uti:\n\nnaduti (nadme) perf. bloat\noteti (otme) perf. hijack\nuzeti (uzme) perf. take\nThe following roots also fall into this class; they are used to derive several important\nverbs, all perfective:\n-četi (-čne):\n  početi (počne) perf. begin\n  začeti (začne) perf. conceive\n-peti (-pne):\n  napeti (napne) perf. wind up\n  popeti (popne) se² perf. climb\n  raspeti (raspne) perf. crucify\n  zapeti (zapne) perf. stumble\n-suti (-spe):\n  nasuti (naspe) perf. cover\n  rasuti (raspe) perf. dissipate\nThe verbs from this class have pass. adj. obtained just by removing -i from the\ninfinitive (e.g. počet, napet, rasut, otet). This all also holds for verbs derived from\nthem by prefixing.\nFinally, these two verbs are today quite archaic, but verbs derived from them are\ncommon:\n\nThe second verb has another possible infinitive form: strti. These verbs are\nimperfective; verbs derived from them by prefixing (e.g. u-mrijeti) are perfective,\nand still belong to this class. To get impf. pairs of the prefixed verbs, use verbs\nending on -irati (-ire), e.g. um-irati (um-ire).\nWith inserted n in present\nCertain verbs have present like n-verbs, but have infinitives without n, leading to all\npossible sound shifts in infinitive and past forms. All such verbs are perfective.\nThis is the only verb in this class without sound shifts (and all verbs derived from it,\nmost of them very frequent!):\nstati (stane) perf. stop\nThe following verbs behave as d/t-root in the past and infinitive:\n\npasti (padne, pao) perf. fall\nsjesti (sjedne, sjeo) perf. sit\nsresti (sretne, sreo) perf. encounter\nThe following verbs behave as k/g-root in the past and infinitive, and some of them\nalso appear as regular n-verbs:\n-bjeći (-bjegne, -bjegao, -bjegla):\n  izbjeći (izbjegne, izbjegao, izbjegla) perf. avoid\n  pobjeći (pobjegne, pobjegao, pobjegla) perf. run away\nleći (legne, legao, legla) perf. lie (down)\npomoći (pomogne, pomogao, pomogla) perf. help\nstići (stigne, stigao, stigla) perf. arrive (on time)\ndići (digne, digao, digla) perf. raise\n  also dignuti (digne)\nnići (nikne, nikao, nikla) perf. sprout\n  also niknuti (nikne)\npući (pukne, pukao, pukla) perf. break, burst\n  also puknuti (pukne)\ntaći (takne, takao, takla) perf. touch\n  also taknuti (takne)\nThe root -bjeći is not used on its own, it's used to derive verbs, listed above.\nOf course, all this applies also to verbs derived by prefixing from the above verbs,\ne.g. po-taknuti / po-taći.\nIrregular past\nThese verbs have past, inf and pres-3 quite different, but forms of the present tense\nare normally derived from their pres-3. They are:\n\notići (ode, otišao, otišla) perf. leave\n-ći (-đe, -šao, -šla)\n-nijeti (-nesem, -nio, -nijela)\nFrom the root -ći (etc.) perfective verbs of motion and naći (etc.) are derived; from -\nnijeti (etc.), perfective verbs derived from bring, e.g. od-nijeti (od-nesem, od-nio,\nod-nijela) perf. take away.\nIrregular present\nThere are three verbs with specific forms in the present tense, their inf and past\nforms are kind of expected. They are be, will and can:\n\ninf\nbiti\nhtjeti\nmoći\npast-m\nbio\nhtio\nmogao\npast-f\nbila\nhtjela\nmogla\npres-1\nsam²\nću²\nmogu\npres-1\nsi²\nćeš²\nmožeš\npres-3\nje²\nće²\nmože\npres-1pl\nsmo²\nćemo²\nmožemo\npres-2pl\nste²\nćete²\nmožete\npres-3pl\nsu²\nće²\nmogu\nimper-2\nbudi\n—\n—\nPresent tense forms of biti and htjeti also have stressed (longer) forms.",

      "content": "This chapter uses specific stress symbols,\ndifferent than in the rest of Easy Croatian.\nI will give you an overview of stress in Croatian, both Standard Croatian, non-\nstandard and in closely related languages. Everything that follows applies to\nStandard Croatian and Standard Bosnian and Standard Serbian unless otherwise is\nexplicitly stated.\nGeneral Issues\nFirst, in the Standard Croatian, each vowel can be either short or long. There can be\nmore than one long vowel in one word. I will mark the vowels as:\nVowel length\nshort vowel\na\nlong vowel\nā\nThis holds also for \"vocalic\" r: there's long r̄ ; however I will mark it as ŕ, since just a\nline over r is, unfortunately, not rendered right in some browsers and mobile\nphones.\nThe stress can be either falling or rising. The falling stress has a tone that's audibly\nfirst high and then falling and staying low. Since the stressed vowel can be either\nshort or long, there are 4 combinations – the 4 classic \"accents\" as described in the\n19th century:\n  short vowel\n  long vowel\nfalling\nstress\n          ri -   ba\n          sūn   -   ce\nrising\nstress\n          vo - da\n          rū     -     ka\nI have introduced here the following, special, non-standard markings:\nif only one vowel is underlined, it's the stressed vowel with the falling\nintonation;\nif two vowels are underlined, one after another, the first of them is the\n\nstressed vowel with the rising intonation;\nas a special case, if no vowels are underlined, the first vowel is stressed with\nthe falling intonation (you'll see the reason a bit later).\n(There are also standard stress markings in Croatian. However, these markings are\nnot really transparent, so in certain books and linguistic works, alternative marks are\noften used.)\nNow, most textbooks (including the schoolbooks in Croatia) mention two classic\nrules that restrict the place of stress:\n#1 the falling intonation can appear only on the first syllable;\n#2 the rising intonation cannot appear on the last syllable (therefore it cannot\nappear at all in one-syllable words).\nNow, the restriction #2 is actually obvious from my notation: you have to underline\ntwo vowels, therefore, you need a word with at least two vowels! There's no way to\nset a rising stress on the last vowel – only the first vowel you underlined will be\nstressed.\nHowever, the restriction #1 is not obvious, and it's actually not always respected in\nreal life, even in areas where people use stress very close to the standard at home\n(enter non-initial falling tones into Google™).\nThis all so far is only the introduction to real issues. The main feature of stress in\nStandard Croatian is that it changes in various forms of one word. Moreover, the\nvowel length changes in some forms! For example, the word lonac pot has all\npossible alternations (rising vs. falling, short vs. long vowel):\nsing.\nplur.\nN\nlonac\nlōnci\nG\nlōnca\nlonācā\nOn the other hand, there are words that have the same stress in all forms. To make\nit even more complex, stress sometimes shift to prepositions.\nNoun Stress\nHowever, there's an underlying system, bizarre but regular. Let's first visit the noun\nstress: nouns are basically divided into three groups. Let's first see how the a-nouns\n(nouns ending in -a in N) behave:\n\n\"A\"\n\"B\"\n\"C\"\nN\nriba\nžena\nvoda\nDL\nribi\nženi\nvodi\nG\nribē\nženē\nvodē\nA\nu-\nribu\nribu\nu-\nženu\nženu\nu-\nvodu\nvodu\nV\nribo\nženo\nvodo\nNA-pl\nribe\nžene\nvode\nWe see one thing all nouns have in common: the vocative case has the \"automatic\"\nfalling stress – no vowels are underlined. Another thing that's not obvious from the\nusual spelling – the case ending in G is a long e.\nThe nouns in the group \"B\" are boring: the stress stays on the same syllable and is\nsame in all forms (except in the vocative, but that's a special form anyway).\nThe group \"A\" gets interesting when an unstressed preposition (e.g. u) is placed\nbefore the noun: the stress \"spreads\" to it, i.e. moves one syllable to the left, but\ngets the rising intonation.\nThis stress shift we still see in such nouns is called Neoštokavian stress shift. It's the\norigin of the rising intonation in the Standard Croatian: whenever (well... almost\nwhenever) there was another syllable before the stressed syllable with the falling\nintonation, the stress moved left, and changed the intonation. It also happened\ncenturies ago to nouns like žena. There are still regions in Croatia where that noun\nkeeps the older stress, žena (we are sure that stress is older because such nouns in\nRussian have the stress at the \"old\" position as well).\nThis is why a rising stress cannot appear on the last syllable – there have to be one\nsyllable after it, one that had the original (falling) stress. We can simply show what\nhas happened and what still happens:\n\ncenturies ago\nžena → žena\nwe see today\npo + ribu → po-ribu\nSuch stresses are called 'new' (this is relative: they are centuries old), hence the neo-\nin Neoštokavian.\nThis shift happens only to falling stresses. They were transformed almost always\nwhen they were not on the first syllable – this is the reason for the classic rule #1.\nNow, we examine the nouns in the group \"C\". They are completely unlike \"A\" or \"B\"\nnouns: their stress varies according to noun case. In the accusative case, if there's\n\nan unstressed preposition before the noun, the stress again shifts to it, but it's still\nfalling. In fact, it shifts as leftward as it can:\nvodu\nu-vodu\ni-u-vodu\nSuch shift is the reason for my \"special case\" notation – when no vowels are\nunderlined, as in A and N-pl of \"C\" nouns – there's a falling intonation stress on the\nvery first syllable, including all unstressed words before the noun that are\npronounced together with it.\nThere's no way to tell which nouns are in the group \"C\" just by looking at them in the\nnominative – they must be remembered. Textbooks say there's about 60 such a-\nnouns. The common ones are:\ndaska plank\ngrāna branch\ngrēda wooden beam\nigla needle\nkosa hair (on scalp)\nmetla broom\novca sheep\n\npēta heel\nrosa dew\nsrijēda Wednesday\nstrijēla arrow\nsŕna fem. roe deer\nstijēna rock\nstrāna side\nvōjska army\nzora dawn\nzīma winter\nzvijēzda star\nThe nouns above have the strange \"automatic\" falling stress only in A. However, a\ncouple of common nouns can have such stress in DL as well:\ndūša soul\nglāva head\nnoga leg\nrūka arm/hand\nvoda water\nzemlja ground, country, Earth\n(The rest is coming soon...)",

      "content": "This chapter uses specific stress symbols,\ndifferent than in the rest of Easy Croatian.\n(This chapter is under construction.)\nI'll give a brief overview of dialects in Croatia and neighboring countries.\nCroatia belongs to the South Slavic language area, and to the wider Slavic area. Both\nthese areas are essentially dialect continua, that is, areas where any dialect is similar\nto the dialect next to it, which is similar to the one next to it, and so on: difference\nbetween dialects increases with distance, and there are very few sharp dialect\nborders.\nMany features of South Slavic dialects change roughly in the northwest-southeast\ndirection, represented by the arrow in this map:\n(The arrow should go, and does go further into Macedonia and Bulgaria, but I will\nconcentrate on dialects in Croatia and countries next to it.)\nGoing in the direction of the arrow (i.e. to the south-east), features change in this\nway:\n• There are fewer noun forms (that is, different case endings). In Slovenia, nouns\nhave singular, dual and plural forms, and 6 cases with different endings in plural. In\n\nthe area around Niš, Serbia, there is only singular and plural, and only two cases (N\nand A). In Macedonia, nouns have no cases! This doesn't apply to the vocative\ncase, though.\n• There are more verb tenses in use. In the western parts of Croatia, the aorist tense\nis very rarely used. It doesn't exist at all in Slovenia. In Serbia, it's used every day in\nspeech. When you reach Macedonia, there are 9 tenses.\n• Infinitives are less used and finally disappear in South of Serbia, where only da +\npresent is used.\n• Vocatives are more often used – in western parts of Croatia, vocatives are rare, N\nis used when calling someone. In Bosnia and Serbia, they are frequently used.\n• There are more Greek and Turkish loan words further you go to the south-east.\nThere are couple of forms that are specific for ‘west’ and ‘east’:\n\n‘west’\n‘east’\nyou can\nmoreš\nmožeš\nfour men/boys\nčetvero\nčetvoro\nEach feature splits the area at a different line. Standard Croatian has the ‘eastern’\nmožeš, but the ‘western’ četvero.\nFurthermore, there's something interesting: most dialectal variation is in the\nnorthwest. In the central and southeastern areas, there's less dialects on the same\nland area. (That's due to history.) It's obvious from this simplified and not-too-\naccurate dialect map, showing the dialects in villages in middle 20th century (click on\nthe image to enlarge):\n\nDialects are marked with the following two-letter abbreviations, here grouped into\ntraditional dialect groups (the usual term in Croatian is narječje):\n‘Slovene’: CR - Carinthian, ST - Styrian, PA - Pannonian, UC - Upper Carniolan, LC -\nLower Carniolan, RV - Rovte, LI - Littoral;\n‘Kajkavian’: ZM - Zagorje-Međimurje, TP - Turopolje-Posavina, KP - Križevci-\nPodravina, PR - Prigorje;\n‘Čakavian’: NČ - Northwestern Čakavian, CČ - Central Čakavian, SČ - Southeastern\nČakavian;\n‘Štokavian’: SL - Slavonian, WI - Western Ikavian, HK - Herzegovina-Krajina (East\nHerzegovinian), EB - East Bosnian, ŠV - Šumadija-Vojvodina, SM - Smederevo-Vršac,\nZS - Zeta-Sandžak, KR - Kosovo-Resava;\n‘Torlak’: PM - Prizren-South Morava, TL - Timok-Lužnica.\nThere are other ways to divide dialects: for example, the classification of ‘Čakavian’\ndialects shown here is after Dutch linguist Willem Vermeer; you'll find other ways to\nclassify them in many books. Some dialects shown here together are usually shown\nseparately – even if they are quite alike neighboring ones – for traditional (and\npolitical) reasons (e.g. Lower Carniolan dialects in Croatia are usually shown\nseparately as ‘goranski’, etc.\nThe grouping of dialects into ‘Kajkavian’, ‘Čakavian’ and ‘Štokavian’ is usually\n\npresented as something fundamental. However, it's not really so: for example,\nNorthwestern Čakavian dialects have a lot of similarities with the Littoral dialects in\nSlovenia; ‘Kajkavian’ Zagorje-Međimurje dialects have many similarities with\nPannonian dialects in Slovenia; ‘Torlak’ dialects are often grouped with ‘Štokavian’,\nbut they have many similarities with dialects in Macedonia and Bulgaria as well;\nthere's no sharp border between Southeastern Čakavian and ‘Štokavian’ Western\nIkavian; ‘Štokavian’ Slavonian dialects have similarities with ‘Čakavian’ dialects, etc.\nThe Origin of Dialects\nWestern South Slavic Dialects differ in many ways, one of them is development of\nold vowels. Western South Slavic, some 1000 years ago, had the following vowels\n(the situation was different in Eastern South Slavic, i.e. today Macedonia and\nBulgaria), and all of them could be either short or long:\ni                   u\ně     ə     ö\ne ë    o\na\n  l   r\nTo mark long vowels, in descriptions of old, reconstructed forms, and in brief\ndescriptions of various dialects, I’ll just write them double, e.g. aa or ee. For\ninstance sun was sllnce and hand was rööka.\nDevelopments of the old vowels ě and ə – often called yat and yer – are most\nobvious to the majority of speakers. Actually, ‘Ijekavian’, ‘Ikavian’ and ‘Ekavian’ are\njust different developments of the vowel ě (yat).\nThe vowels ë and ö were nasal, like in today French or Portuguese.\nThere were also two specific consonants, usually labelled as d' and t'. They were\npalatal (softened) d and t. The verb doći (dođe) was earlier dojti (dojde); in some\ndialects, jt and jd have later changed.\n(I'm using slightly specific symbols here; usually, in specialized literature, ę and ǫ are\nused instead of my ë and ö. Unfortunately, they are not displayed properly on some\nmobile phones and e-book readers. Also, ḷ and ṛ are usually used instead of l and r.\nNeither symbols are compatible with the IPA notation).\nThen, we need marks for various types of stress. I’ll use the following marks for\nstress and tones within one syllable:\na\nshort, stressed\naa\nlong stressed vowel with a falling tone\naa\nlong stressed vowel with a rising/flat tone\nThe tone I mark as aa is also called ‘neoacute’; it doesn’t exist in Standard Croatian.\n\nAnd finally, I’ll use the following marks for two-syllable tones, where the stressed\nsyllable has another syllable with the high tone that follows it:\na...a\nshort stressed\n+ a high tone following it\naa...a\nlong stressed\nThis can be summarized simply: the first underscored vowel is stressed, the\nunderscores mark high tones.\nIf you are going to read any dialectological works, you’ll see the standard ‘accent\nmarks’. Unfortunately, they are not rendered well on some mobile phones and e-\nbook readers, they are difficult to distinguish at small font sizes, and, finally, they are\nquite counter-intuitive. Here's how my marks translate to the standard ones (the\ndiacritics are also shown in brackets):\naa = ā (–)\na = ȁ (\\\\)\naa = ȃ (^)\naa = ã (~)\na...a = à...a (\\)\naa...a = á...a (/)\nTherefore, what I write as e.g. öö is in most linguistic works written as ǫ with-a-\ntilde-above.\nStress systems in various dialects have the origin in the old system, reconstructed for\nthe old West South Slavic, for the period od some 1000 years ago, where there were\nat least 2 tones on the syllables. The stress could have been on any syllable, and\nunstressed syllables could be also short or long. The reconstructed forms of some\nwords are:\nmlěěko milk\nrööka hand\nvětər wind\n\nsestra sister (G-pl sestəər)\n\n(It's possible to reconstruct even earlier forms – in many cases, thousands years\nearlier – but they aren't important here.)\n‘Kajkavian’ (Zagorje-Međimurje)\nAn example ‘Kajkavian’ dialect is the speech of Konjščina, with a detailed description\nby Vedrana Gudek, available online.\nThe first impression anyone has about ‘Kajkavian’ are specific vowels. While there\nare only 5 vowels in e.g. Zagreb, the traditional speech of Konjščina has many more:\n\nshort\n\nlong/diphtongs\ni\ne\n\nε\nu\n\no\na\n\nii\nie   ee\n\nεε\nuu\nuo   ou\noo\naa\nThe vowel ε – a kind of ‘open e’, like in English bad or German ä – is the\ncharacteristic vowel for ‘Kajkavian’. Unfortunately, it’s usually written just as e:\nthere's no proper orthography for it (dialectologists usually use ȩ, which is not visible\non all devices, or sometimes æ).\nVowels ie, uo, ou are diphtongs, similar to English ow in low, how, but the i's and u's\nin them are, unlike in English, pronounced very quickly, they are very short, so I could\nhave written them also as ie, uo, ou.\nUnfortunately, long vowels ii, εε are too usually written just with i and e. Here are a\ncouple of words with various vowels:\ndietε child (djete, usually spelled dijete)\nmεεse meat (meso)\nrouka hand (ruka)\nsuonce sun (sunce)\n(For comparison, forms spoken in Zagreb are given in brackets).\nIn ‘Kajkavian’ (and in dialects in Slovenia) there's one important constraint: normally,\nonly stressed vowels can be long, i.e. there are no unstressed long vowels, while\nstressed vowels can be either long or short. Since the vowel length and stress often\nchanges according to the word form (i.e. gender, case), this produces many\nalternations:\ndober (m) vs. duobra (f) good\nrouka (N) vs. rukami (I-pl) hand\nThese are specific developments of old vowels and consonants in this dialect (other\n‘Kajkavian’ dialects have very similar developments):\ne, ë\ně\nə\no\nö\nl\nshort\nε\ne\ne\no\n-e\nu\nou\nlong\nεε\nie\nie\naa\noo\nuo\nou\nou\nMany ‘Kajkavian’ dialects (but not all) have -e instead of -o in all neuter nouns and\nadjectives in neuter gender, i.e. sεεle village vs. std. selo.\nWhen compared with the forms reconstructed for the old language – some 1000\n\nyears ago – in most ‘Kajkavian’ dialects (but not all) the stress has shifted from the\nvery end of the word, becoming the ‘neoacute’ on the preceding syllable;\nsometimes, the syllable that gets the stress will be lenghtened:\nrööka → rouka hand\nžena → žεεna woman, wife\nviino → viino wine\nThe old jd and jt are mostly unchanged in ‘Kajkavian’, while t' changed into č, and in\nmost dialects d' into j.\nThere's no ć sound – only č, which is pronounced a bit ‘softer’ than in the Standard\nCroatian. Consonants at the end of words become ‘devoiced’, i.e. d is pronounced\nas t, b as p, g as k, z as s, etc. For instance, the z in mraz frost is actually pronounced\nas s, while the pronunciation of genitive mraza is as z, since the consonant is not\nfinal.\nThe present tense verb plural endings in this dialect are more regular than in\nStandard Croatian; the ending for the 1st pers. plural is quite specific:\nsing.\nplur\n1st\n-m\n-mε\n2nd\n-š\n-tε\n3rd\n-\n-ju\n(the rest is coming soon)",

      "content": "Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin are separate standard languages quite similar to\nthe Standard Croatian (some people consider them ‘variants’ of a single language). I\nwill summarize the most important differences.\nYou should keep in mind that there are regions in Croatia where some ‘Serbian’\nwords are used, and some ‘Croatian’ words can be found in Serbia as well. Of\ncourse, Bosnian and Montenegrin are somewhere in the middle. Furthermore, we\ncan talk about ‘Croatian’ and ‘Serbian’ only if we discuss the standardized languages.\nIf we take into the account how people actually speak, the situation is much more\ncomplex.\nSpelling\nThe major difference is that Serbian and Montenegrin use another alphabet –\nCyrillic. However, each letter of Croatian Latin corresponds to one letter of Serbian\nCyrillic.\nActually, in Serbia today the Cyrillic alphabet is mostly used in official and\nceremonial uses. Majority of newspapers are published in the ‘Serbian Latin’ script\n(identical to ‘Croatian Latin’). Web sites published in Cyrillic have usually a ‘LAT’\nbutton somewhere. For instance, Politika daily has pages both in Cyrillic and Latin\n(check CYR and LAT links on top), but B92 is in Latin only. Even the web site of\nSerbian government has links ћирилица Cyrillic and latinica Latin on the top (Cyrillic\nis chosen by default). Statistics show that about 1/6 of text on Serbian web sites is\nwritten in the Cyrillic script.\nIn Montenegro, the Cyrillic alphabet is even less used. The web site of Montenegrin\ngovernment has the two links on top, but the Latin script is displayed as default.\nMost web pages, even official ones, are in Latin script only.\nBesides using Cyrillic script sometimes, there are few differences in spelling (both in\n\nSerbian and Montenegrin usually respell them using approximated pronunciation:\noriginal\n  Serbian spelling\nNew York\nNjujork\nЊујорк\nGeorge Bush\nDžordž Buš\nЏорџ Буш\nChicago\nČikago\nЧикаго\nThe second difference is spelling of the future tense. When an infinitive in -t is\nimmediately followed by an auxiliary ću², ćeš²... it’s spelled together, and the\ninfinitive-final -t is discarded, with possible sound mutations:\n\nCroatian\n      Serbian\npisat ću\npisaću\nписаћу\njest ću\nješću\nјешћу\nreći ću\nreći ću\nрећи ћу\nThis is, however, merely a spelling convention: the words ću², ćeš² are second-\nposition words; therefore, Serbian words like pisaću are limited to the 1st position\nin a sentence! They are usually listed as separate verb forms in Serbian grammars.\nEkavian ‘Pronunciation’\nAs I have already mentioned, there are three common ‘pronunciations’: Ijekavian,\nIkavian and Ekavian (there are more in various dialects, but these three prevail in\npublic). The name is misleading, since the difference is visible in spelling as well. The\nbasic difference is: where Standard Croatian has Ijekavian mlijeko, Ikavian has\nmliko and Ekavian mleko for milk.\nPeople usually associate Ekavian (mleko, pesma) and not Ijekavian (mlijeko,\npjesma) with Serbian, but it’s not really true, since Serbs use both as standard: most\nSerbs outside of Serbia (e.g. Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro) use Ijekavian, and\nSerbs in most of Serbia, including Belgrade, use only Ekavian. You can find both in\nSerbian newspapers, but Ekavian clearly dominates. (The Serbian Standard is much\nless strict than Croatian, there is a bigger choice of ‘acceptable’ variants.)\nIf you find a ‘dictionary of differences’ listing bijeli as ‘Croatian’ vs. beli as ‘Serbian’\nyou can immediately conclude it’s oversimplifying things.\nThere’s a tradition of playing down differences between Ekavian and Ijekavian: most\npeople, especially in Serbia, are used to hear and read both (but they can write and\nspeak only Ekavian). However, Ekavian forms are not completely trivial – they\ncannot be completely obtained from (Standard Croatian) Ijekavian forms, and\nIjekavian forms cannot be obtained at all from Ekavian. For example, there are some\nwords where Ekavian has e, in comparison to Ijekavian i, like in these common\nverbs:\nverb\nIjekavian\nEkavian\nheat\ngrijati (grije)\ngrejati (greje)\nlaugh\n\nhate\nmrziti\nmrzeti (mrzi)\nsit\nsjediti\nsedeti (sedi)\nbe worth\nvrijediti\nvredeti (vredi)\nThese differences are sometimes surprising to native speakers as well: very few\n\npeople in Croatia would guess the forms mrzeti and vredeti. Different verbs have to\nbe learned: the verb brijati (brije) shave has the same form in both ‘pronunciations’,\nwhile grijati (grije) heat doesn’t. The verb sjediti shows the expected je vs. e in the\n1st syllable, besides the unexpected i vs. e in the second one (the same holds for\nvrijediti). Therefore, Ekavian forms of these verbs turn out to be more complicated.\nHowever, the verb vidjeti and similar ones, including razumjeti, are much simpler in\nEkavian: their past forms are always regular, and verbs like razumjeti are plain verbs\nin Ekavian, all forms regularly derived from the inf:\nverb\nIjekavian\nEkavian\nwant\nhtjeti (hoće +, htio, htjela)\nhteti (hoće +)\nsee\nvidjeti (vidi, vidio, vidjela)\nvideti (vidi)\nunderstand\nrazumjeti (razumije,...)\nrazumeti\nmay\n\nThe Ekavian verbs razumeti and smeti have a specific ending in pres-3pl: -eju, which\nis different from Ijekavian or Ikavian.\nSequences -je- in endings of verbal adjectives are not subject to these differences.\nIn all ‘pronunciations’, words voljen loved, primljen received etc. have the same\nform.\nThe same applies to verbal nouns in -je; the difference in sjećanje vs. sećanje (both\nmeaning memory) is only in the 1st syllable; the final -je, which forms the gerund, is\nnot affected.\nThere are more words with non-trivial correspondences:\nword\nIjekavian\nEkavian\npart\ndio (dijel-) deo (del-)\nlast year\nlani\nlane\nlazy\nlijen\nlenj\nWhen -je comes after a vowel which is not i (e.g. dvoje two people, jaje egg) the\nforms are the same in Ekavian, Ijekavian and Ikavian. Of course, the same applies to\nverbal forms such as pije he/she drinks nije he/she/it is not etc. Ekavian forms have\nto be learned if you want to know them.\nI will list Serbian words in both Ijekavian and Ekavian forms in this chapter.\nOther partially regular differences\nA major difference is loss of h in native words in Serbian (both Ekavian and\nIjekavian; however, it was restored at the beginning of words in standard Serbian). It\n\nhas been replaced by either v or j:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\ndeaf\ngluh\ngluv\ndry\nsuh\nsuv\nfly (insect)\nmuha\nmuva\ncook (verb) kuhati\nkuvati\nson’s wife\nsnaha\nsnaja\nIn nouns ending in -ol, Serbian (both Ekavian and Ijekavian) had lost final -l, which is\nrestored whenever any ending is added. It also happened to -r in nouns and adverbs\nending in -er:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nsalt\nsol f\nso (sol-) f\ntable\nstol\nsto (stol-) m\nox\nvol\nvo (vol-) m\nevening\n\nveče (večer- f)\nyesterday\njučer\njuče\nalso\ntakođer\ntakođe\nThis change didn’t happen in bol pain.\nThe noun veče is considered neuter in N and A, and feminine when it gets any\nending, which is an occasional source of confusion for native speakers.\nThere are a bit simplified forms or pronouns; however, these forms are colloquially\nused in Croatia as well:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nwho\ntko\nko\nsomeone\nnetko\nneko\nwhat\nšto\nšta\nIn some words there’s su in Croatian vs. sa in Serbian, while in others there’s no\ndifference; common examples are:\n\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\ncooperation\nsuradnja\nsaradnja\nconsent\nsuglasnost f\nsaglasnost f\nconflict\n              sukob\ncontents\n              sadržaj\nAs you can see, such words often correspond to English words with co- or con-, but\nthere’s no real rule which words have the difference, and which don’t.\nVocabulary Differences in Nouns and Adjectives\nSerbian has some specific common nouns:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nbladder\nmjehur\nbešika\nweek\ntjedan (tjedn-)\nnedjelja\nnedelja\nsedmica\nisland\notok\nostrvo\npants, trousers\nhlače f pl.\npantalone f pl.\nfarmer’s market\ntržnica\npijaca\nfloor (of a building)\nkat\nsprat\nwave\nval\ntalas\nhandbag, purse\ntorba\ntašna\nwheel (not to steer)\nkotač\ntočak (točk-)\ncondition, prerequisite\nuvjet\nuslov\nair\nzrak\nvazduh\nSome words are only slightly different:\n\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\neyeglasses\nnaočale f pl. naočari f. pl.\nprice-list\ncjenik\ncjenovnik\ncenovnik\nsalary\nplaća\nplata\npoint, dot\ntočka\ntačka\npriest\nsvećenik\nsveštenik\nphysician (m) liječnik\nljekar\nlekar\nphysician (f)\nliječnica\nljekarka\nlekarka\ncoal\nugljen\nugalj (uglj-)\nThere are also different terms related to modern life:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nfactory\ntvornica\nfabrika\nfootball\nnogomet\nfudbal\ntrain\nvlak\nvoz\nmovie theatre\nkino\nbioskop\nmobile phone\nmobitel\nmobilni (adj.)\nEspecially, terms related to cooking, food, and standard house items show\nnumerous differences; these terms are often completely unknown outside their\n'territory':\n\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\ngreen beans\nmahune f pl.\nboranija\napricot\nmarelica\nkajsija\nbread\nkruh\nhljeb\nhleb\nbeans\ngrah\npasulj\nrice\nriža\npirinač\ncarrot\nmrkva\nšargarepa\nleek\nporiluk\npraziluk\nvinegar\nocat (oct-)\nsirće (sirćet-)\nsoup\njuha\nsupa\nspoon\nžlica\nkašika\ncup (of tea, coffee) šalica\nšolja\nscissors\nškare f pl.\nmakaze f pl.\ntowel\nručnik\npeškir\nHowever, in real life, the variation in culinary terms is much greater, especially\nwithin Croatia. Some ‘Croatian’ terms like riža and mrkva are also used in Serbia,\nespecially in some parts, and sometimes a distinction is made between mrkva and\nšargarepa.\nThere are numerous differences in scientific terms, especially chemistry and biology:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nhydrogen\nvodik\nvodonik\noxygen\nkisik\nkiseonik\nnitrogen\ndušik\nazot\ntin\nkositar (kositr-)\nkalaj\ngas\nplin\ngas\nliquid\ntekućina\ntečnost\n(chem.) compound\nspoj\njedinjenje\n(chem.) solution\notopina\nrastvor\ncell (in biology)\nstanica\nćelija\nmammal\nsisavac (sisavc-) sisar\nrat\nštakor\npacov\ncamel\ndeva\nkamila\nscience\nznanost\nnauka\n\nHowever, prison cell is just ćelija in both Croatian and Serbian. Croatian uses obitelj\nf for human family, while Serbian uses porodica, and both usually use just porodica\nfor families in biology (sets of closely related species).\nThere are also different terms in math, and generally school:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\ntriangle\ntrokut\ntrougao (trougl-)\nrule (to draw lines)\nravnalo\nlenjir\nstraight line\npravac (pravc-)\nprava\ncurve\nkrivulja\nkriva\nsum\nzbroj\nzbir\ndegree\nstupanj (stupnj-) stepen\nequation\njednadžba\njednačina\nlecture, class in school\nsat\nčas\nclass (group of students) razred\nodjeljenje\nodeljenje\nHowever, notice that razred in both Croatia and Serbia means grade in school (e.g.\nprvi razred first grade).\nSome words have only a slightly different form due to different adaptation of\nforeign words (this table includes only characteristic words showing ways words\ndiffer):\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\naccent\nakcent\nakcenat (akcent-)\nfascist\nfašist\nfašista\nflu\ngripa\ngrip\ncasette\nkazeta\nkaseta\nmayonnaise\nmajoneza\nmajonez\norange\nnaranča\n\nchimp\nčimpanza\nšimpanza\nclown\nklaun\nklovn\nThe form kaseta is standard in Croatian as well, but it’s very rare in real use.\nSome words adapted from Greek have k- in Croatian, and h- in Serbian; another,\nless common difference in such words is -b- vs -v-, and -c- vs -k-:\n\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nchemistry\nkemija\nhemija\nchaos\nkaos\nhaos\nchlorine\nklor\nhlor\nsurgeon\nkirurg\nhirurg\nlabyrinth\nlabirint\nlavirint\nocean\nocean\nokean\nSome regions, countries and cities also have different names, sometimes the\ndifference is slight:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nAthens\nAtena\nAtina\nBabylon\nBabilon\nVavilon\nCyprus\nCipar (Cipr-)\nKipar (Kipr-)\nEurope\nEuropa\nEvropa\nPersia\nPerzija\nPersija\nThe Netherlands\nNizozemska (adj.) Holandija\nRomania\nRumunjska (adj.)\nRumunija\nSpain\nŠpanjolska (adj.)\nŠpanija\nThere are more different names, these are just the most common; the difference\napplies to derived adjectives and names of inhabitants, of course. Additionally,\nthere’s a difference in adjectives derived from places ending in -iški:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nParisian\npariški\npariski\nTunisian\ntuniški\ntuniski\nWords related to government, having the suffix -kracija in Croatian, have -kratija in\nSerbian:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nbureucracy\nbirokracija\nbirokratija\ndemocracy\ndemokracija\ndemokratija\nThere are terms which correspond to two words in Croatia – an ‘international’ one,\nand a word made from Slavic roots (or borrowed from Czech in the 19th century) –\nwhich are used interchangeably, or one is formal and the other colloquial, or there’s\n\na small difference in meaning, while only the ‘international’ word in used in Serbian.\nCommon pairs are:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian & Croatian\nlibrary\nknjižnica\nbiblioteka\nmachine\nstroj\nmašina\nmusic\nglazba\nmuzika\nsystem\nsustav\nsistem\nFor example, in Croatia, only knjižnica is used for public libraries, while biblioteka\ncan mean any book collection, e.g. in someone’s home.\nIn Serbian, suffixes -ka and -kinja are more common to derive feminine nouns, while\nCroatian prefers -ica; again, in some terms there’s no difference:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\nuniversity student (f) studentica\nstudentkinja\ndoctor (f)\ndoktorica\ndoktorka\nteacher (f)\n          učiteljica\nmathematician (f)\n          matematičarka\nForms studentica and doktorica are accepted as standard in Serbian as well, but are\nmuch less common than the alternative forms.\nThere are some specific adjectives as well; again, some are only slightly different:\nterm\nCroatian\nSerbian\ncommon\nopći\nopšti\nhappy, lucky\nsretan (srećn-)\nsrećan (srećn-)\nused\nkorišten\nkorišćen\nsecure, safe\nsiguran (sigurn-) bezbjed an (-n-)\nbezbed an (-n-)\nVocabulary differences in verbs\nVerbs ending in -isati (-iše) are very characteristic of Serbia and most of Bosnia; they\nusually correspond to Croatian verbs in -irati («). They are all adaptations of foreign\nwords. Common ones are:\n\nverb\n          Croatian\n            Serbian\ndefine\ndefinirati («)\ndefinisati (-še)\nformulate\nformulirati («)\nformulisati (-še)\ngenerate\ngenerirati («)\ngenerisati (-še)\nfunction\n\nignore\nignorirati («)\nignorisati (-še)\nintegrate\nintegrirati («)\nintegrisati (-še)\nintervene\nintervenirati («)\nintervenisati (-še)\nmanage, oversee\nkontrolirati («)\nkontrolisati (-še)\noperate\noperirati («)\noperisati (-še)\nreform\nreformirati («)\nreformisati (-še)\nreserve\nrezervirati («)\nrezervisati (-še)\ntolerate\ntolerirati («)\ntolerisati (-še)\n(The thin vertical line, as usual, divides the constant part on the left of it from the\nvariable part on the right.) They also have stress on different syllables.\nHowever, it’s completely wrong to think that all Croatian verbs in -irati correspond\nto Serbian verbs in this way. In fact, there are many verbs in -irati used in Serbia as\nwell, such as:\n\ndiplomirati («) graduate (on univ.)\n\nstudirati («) study (on univ.)\n\netc.\nAlso, some Croatian -irati verbs correspond to Serbian ones in -ovati (-uje).\nCommon ones are:\nverb\n        Croatian\n            Serbian\nimprovise\nimprovizirati («)\nimprovizovati (-uje)\nisolate\nizolirati («)\nizolovati (-uje)\ncombine\nkombinirati («)\nkombin ovati (-uje)\ncompensate\nkompenzirati («)\nkompenzovati (-uje)\nmodernize\n\norganize\norganizirati («)\norganizovati (-uje)\npack\npakirati («)\npak ovati (-uje)\n\nWhen such verbs have -cirati in Croatian, they have -kovati in Serbian:\nverb\n        Croatian\n            Serbian\ndisinfect, sanitize\ndezinficirati («)\ndezinfik ovati (-uje)\nidentify\n\ncomplicate\nkomplicirati («)\nkomplik ovati (-uje)\nmodify\nmodificirati («)\nmodifik ovati (-uje)\nOccasionally, there’s a non-trivial correspondence to Croatian -irati verbs:\nverb\nCroatian\nSerbian\ncomment\n\nMany recently adapted verbs – mostly colloquial – often have just -ati in Croatia vs -\novati (-uje) in Serbia:\nverb\nCroatian\n        Serbian\nlike (on Facebook)\nlajkati\nlajk ovati (-uje)\nsurf\nsurfati\nsurf ovati (-uje)\nstrike (in workplace)\n\nThere are few more verbs are used a bit differently in Serbian.\nThe verb smjeti (smije, smio, smjela) may – in Ekavian form smeti – has an\nadditional meaning in Serbia: dare.\nThe verb umjeti (umije, umio, umjela) know how – in Ekavian form umeti – is quite\ncommon in Serbia:\nUmijem da plivam! I know how to swim. (Ijekavian)\nUmem da plivam! (the same, Ekavian)\nThese verbs are specific as well:\nverb\nCroatian\nSerbian\nbe silent\nšutjeti / šutiti\nćutati (ćuti)\nmove, shift\npomicati (pomiče) ~\n pomaknuti (pomakne)\npomjerati («) ~\n pomjeriti\npomerati («) ~\n pomeriti\nmention\nspominjati ~¹\n spomenuti (spomene)\npominjati ~¹\n pomenuti (pomene)\nwatch, look at\npromatrati («)\nposmatrati («)\n\nGrammar and other differences\nAdverbs puno/jako vs. mnogo are characteristic in meaning a lot, very. Of course,\nvrlo can be used as well, but it’s not used in speech much. The use of these adverbs\nis different in Croatian and Serbian:\nPuno hvala! Thanks a lot. (mostly Croatian)\nMnogo hvala! Thanks a lot. (Serbian, sometimes Croatian)\nJako sam umorna. I’m very tired. (mostly Croatian)\nMnogo sam umorna. I’m very tired. (Serbian)\nVrlo sam umorna. I’m very tired. (both languages, more formal)\nObserve that mnogo is normally used in both Croatian and Serbian meaning much\n\nThere some often-used nicknames for men in Serbia ending in -a: Pera (from Petar),\nVlada (from Vladimir and similar), Brana (from Branislav), etc., all behaving as any\nname ending in -a. They are quite rare in Croatia, where forms Pero, Vlado, etc. are\npreferred.\nA famous difference is preference for da + present instead of infinitives in Serbia.\nUsing infinitives in Serbia is not ungrammatical, but they are simply rarely used\n(especially in speech); these results are from Google™, in thousands (try yourself\nsimilar expressions):\nform\nCroatia (.hr) Bosnia (.ba) Serbia (.rs)\n\n0.2\n54\n116\n\n74\n51\n10\n\n0\n24\n45\n\n12\n4\n0.3\nAs usual, Bosnia (which includes Ijekavian Serbian in parts of Bosnia) is somewhere\nin between.\nMontenegrin\nMontengrin uses more or less the same vocabulary and spelling conventions as\n\nCroatian/Serbian nismo we aren’t. Words having sequences dj in Croatian often\nhave đ in Montenegrin:\n\nword\nCroatian\nMontenegrin\nwhere\ngdje\nđe\nnowhere\nnigdje\nniđe\ngirl\ndjevojka\nđevojka\nRecently the Montenegrin alphabet introduced two additional letters: ś and ź (there\nare Cyrillic versions as well) for specific consonants heard in speech there – but they\nare rarely used in real life.\nIt has been observed that Montenegrin public media have recently started to use\nmore Croatian forms than before.\nBosnian\nBosnian (or: Bosniak, there’s a dispute over name – there are disputes about almost\neverything) uses only Latin script and Ijekavian. Two spelling differences (e.g.\nNjujork and imaću) are used sometimes in Bosnian, but it seems that Croatian\nversions occasionally prevail (New York, imat ću). Standard Bosnian sometimes\nfreely mixes Croatian and Serbian terms, so both tisuća and hiljada 1000 seem\nacceptable.\nSince Bosnian is a standard used by Bosniaks which are predominantly Muslim, there\nare lot of oriental and Islamic terms. Sound h is always retained, even when not in\nCroatian (one example is lahko easy vs Croatian lako; of course, lahko exists in\nsome dialects in Croatia too, but it’s not standard). There are some specific terms,\ne.g. daidža uncle (Croatian ujak).\nBosnia-Herzegovina is today officially tri-lingual, as evidenced by this warning on a\nbox of cigarettes that displays three identical sentences (the first one is just in\nCyrillic; I have taken a photo of an actual box):",
