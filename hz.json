Vowels can be either long or short (similar to English <i>fit</i> vs. <i>feet</i>) but in some cities (notably, Zagreb, Rijeka and Pula) that distinction is lost.</p>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_BEGIN-->\n<p>Here are some Croatian words to illustrate pronunciation.

The same goes for the first vowels in <b class=\"hrv\">ljudi</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">svinja</b>. Many people (including myself) don’t pronounce such differences.</p>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_END-->\n<p>Therefore, I have decided <em>not</em> to mark long vowels, as it would be too complicated for beginners: the rules are really complex and not respected in real life in many parts of Croatia anyway.</p>\n<p>Also, most people in Croatia pronounce today <b class=\"hrv\">ć</b> the same as <b class=\"hrv\">č</b>, and <b class=\"hrv\">dž</b> the same as <b class=\"hrv\">đ</b>. This feature includes most cities.</p>\n<p>In the Standard pronunciation of <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">dž</b>, the tip of tongue is pressed against the palate (top of the mouth) right above teeth, the teeth are separated, and there’s a gap between lips and teeth; it’s called <em><a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apical_consonant\">apical pronunciation</a></em>.</p>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p>Since the two letters <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">ć</b> have a similar or identical pronunciation (depending on the region of Croatia) people have invented <em>colloquial names for them</em>, used e.g. when you have to explain over the phone how a name is spelled:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">č</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">„tvrdo č”</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ć</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">„meko ć”</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n</div><!-- att -->\n<p>There’s a vowel <b class=\"hrv\">ə</b> (pronounced as <em>e</em> in English <em>the</em>) that’s never spelled; it appears in the following situations:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>1. in seemingly impossible words like <b class=\"hrv\">čvrst</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_cvrst_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>rigid, hard</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">krv</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_krv_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>blood</i>: they can be <em>approximately</em> pronounced with the vowel <b class=\"hrv\">ə</b> (at least by some Croatian speakers) as <b class=\"hrv\">čvərst</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">kərv</b>. Actually, <b class=\"hrv\">krv</b> is pronounced a bit like English <em>curve</em>.</p></div>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>2. the same goes for e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">bicikl</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_bicikl_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>bicycle</i>, which is rather pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">bi-ci-kəl</b> (<em>three</em> syllables).</p></div>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>3. when talking about letters, Croatians often pronounce names of letters with that vowel (e.g. the letter \"<b class=\"hrv\">b</b>\" as <b class=\"hrv\">bə</b>).</p></div>\n<p>Although words should be pronounced as spelled, a great majority of Croatians pronounce the sequence <b class=\"hrv\">ije</b> (when not at the end of the word) as just <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">lijepo</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_lijepo_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a> <i>beautifully</i>\nis <em>usually</em> pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">lje-po</b>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prije</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_prije_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>before</i> is pronounced as written (<b class=\"hrv\">pri-je</b>), since the <b class=\"hrv\">ije</b> comes at the very end\n</p></div>\n<p>Some people pronounce <b class=\"hrv\">lijepo</b> as <b class=\"hrv\">l-j-e-p-o</b> (that is, <b class=\"hrv\">l</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">j</b> are separate sounds; this is regarded as standard), others as <b class=\"hrv\">lj-e-p-o</b>. To help you with the pronunciation, I’ve marked such normally written, but not pronounced <b class=\"hrv\">i</b>’s like this: <b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b>. In the words like <b class=\"hrv\">prije</b>, where all vowels are normally pronounced, nothing is marked.</p>\n<p>There are very few other situations where something is written but not pronounced in Croatian, they will be specially emphasized.</p>\n<p>Croatian spells the foreign names and places how they are originally spelled, if the original spelling uses the Latin script (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">New York</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Chuck Norris</b>), but some words are sometimes respelled; this happens sometimes in Bosnian, and as the rule in Serbian – respelling according to an approximate pronunciation is used (<b class=\"hrv\">Njujork</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Čak Noris</b>).</p>\n<p>Letters such as <b class=\"hrv\">W</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">X</b> etc. are sometimes used in abbreviations taken from other languages, such as <b class=\"hrv\">WC</b> for <i>toilet</i>, and in some last names in Croatia, of originally foreign origin (for example, 43 Croatians have the last name <b class=\"hrv\">Winter</b>, according to the 2011 census results).</p>\n<p>Stress (pronouncing one syllable a bit louder, as in English <em>to<u>ge</u>ther</em>) has quite complex rules and varies in colloquial speech in different parts of Croatia. Stress is <em>never</em> indicated in writing (similar to the practice in English, but unlike Spanish or Italian), and you are simply supposed to know it.</p>\n<p>There are two common ways (or <em>schemes</em>) of stressing words used in speech:</p>\n<p>The <em>standard stress</em> is used in Standard Croatian, and in cities of Split, Osijek, Dubrovnik, and surrounding countryside; the area extends to Bosnia, and most of Serbia. This is what you hear on the Croatian Public Radio and TV (this is the pronunciation you will find in language manuals and good dictionaries).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Standard Croatian has two kinds of stress (ways that one syllable in the word can be stressed): with the <em>rising tone</em> and the <em>falling tone</em>. It’s a bit similar to tones in Swedish or even Chinese. The stress in the Standard Croatian is virtually identical to stress in the Standard Serbian or Bosnian, but many people in Croatia <em>don’t</em> use standard stress in everyday communication. Rules governing standard stress are very complex (the stress changes in various forms of one word) so I think it would be too complex to introduce tones in a course intended for beginners (this approach is followed by most language schools that offer Croatian; I will describe details later, in A7 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"a7.html\">Stress</a>).</p>\n<p>Therefore, I decided just to mark what vowel is stressed, when the stress is not on the first syllable (that’s the default place of stress). This map shows roughly (the shaded area) where the standard stress scheme (or something quite similar to it) prevails in Croatia and neighboring countries, at least in public settings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/wNnrpQY/EC-Std-Stress-Area.png\" title=\"Area where the standard stress is used\"/></p>\n<p>The ‘<em>western stress</em>’ is used colloquially, very often heard in Zagreb, surrounding areas and some other cities, including Rijeka and Pula. You can hear it on local radio stations. This is the pronunciation I personally use in everyday life, at work, in school, etc. (It’s sometimes, confusingly, called ‘urban stress’; you will find virtually nothing about it in textbooks.)</p>\n<p>There are more stress schemes and ways to pronounce words in various dialects, but they are more or less limited to small areas and villages. They will be briefly described in the section on dialects.</p>\n<p>I won’t describe the stress schemes used in unshaded areas of Serbia and Montenegro. For some words, they are a very similar or identical to the ‘western’ stress, for others, quite different.</p>\n<p>I will also mark the stressed vowel in the ‘western’ stress, when it’s different from the standard stress position. For many words, there’s little or no difference, and for others, there’s an obvious difference, as demonstrated with words <b class=\"hrv\">ponekad</b> <i>sometimes</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">kolač</b> <i>cake</i> (I have underlined the stressed vowels):\n\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">word</th>\n<th>standard</th><th class=\"last\">‘western’</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ponekad</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>nekad</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_ponekad_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">pon<u>e</u>kad</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_ponekad_w')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">kolač</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>lač</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_kolac_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kol<u>a</u>č</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('01_kolac_w')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>As you can see, some people pronounce the words <b class=\"hrv\">ponekad</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">kolač</b> with the stress on the first syllable, and some others with the stress on the second syllable. You would never know it from the normal spelling, since stress is normally not marked.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I marked the word <b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>n<u>e</u>kad</b> and similar ones with <em>two</em> stress positions (that is, I have underlined two vowels). The first mark (from left) is <em>always</em> the standard position and the second mark (if indicated) the ‘western’ stress position.</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad tiny\" colspan=\"3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad vcent\" colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\">\n  the first mark (if present):<br>  <em>standard stress</em></br></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\" colspan=\"2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad bordl bordt\"> </td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad tiny\" colspan=\"2\"></td>\n<td class=\"nopad tiny bordl\" colspan=\"5\"></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad tiny bordl\" colspan=\"4\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad vcent\" rowspan=\"2\">\n  the second mark (if present):<br>\n  <em>‘western’ stress</em></br></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad bordl\" colspan=\"3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad bordl bordt\"> </td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad tiny\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad tiny\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad bordl tiny\" colspan=\"2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad tiny\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad bordl tiny\" colspan=\"2\"> </td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\"><b class=\"hrv\">p</b></td>\n<td class=\"nopad\" colspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"nopad\"><b class=\"hrv\">n</b></td>\n<td class=\"nopad\" colspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>e</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"nopad\"><b class=\"hrv\">kad</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č</b> and many others are marked in the same way. (Such markings are my invention. There are also standard stress symbols, but they are quite complicated and used only in specialized books. You can find more in Wikipedia and elsewhere.)</p>\n<p>Bear in mind, if nothing is marked, the word is stressed on the first syllable. If there’s only one mark, practically everyone pronounces the stress on the same syllable.</p>\n<p>There are a few words where the standard stress is <em>not</em> on the first syllable, but the ‘western’ stress <em>is</em>; one of them is the word for <i>binoculars</i>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\nstandard: <b class=\"hrv\">dalek<u>o</u>zor</b><br/>\n‘western’: <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>a</u>lekozor</b>\n</td><td class=\"last vcent\">=   <b class=\"hrv\">dalek<u>o</u>zor</b>ʷ¹\n<td></td></td></tr></table>\n<p>For such words, I’ll underscore the standard stress position, and write in small superscript letters ‘W1’ after the word (i.e. ‘western’ stress on the 1st syllable), as shown above.</p>\n<p>Besides the place of stress in some words, the main difference between the two common ‘schemes’ are <em>stress shifts</em>. They are typical for the standard scheme. These examples will illustrate common <em>stress shifts</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">form</th>\n<th>standard</th>\n<th class=\"last\">‘western’</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>cake</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>lač</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kol<u>a</u>č</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>cakes</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">kol<u>a</u>či</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kol<u>a</u>či</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><i>I’m speaking</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">g<u>o</u>vorim</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">gov<u>o</u>rim</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>I’ll speak</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">gov<u>o</u>rit ću</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">gov<u>o</u>rit ću</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>These were just examples – other words don’t have shifts, and there are other kinds of shifts as well. Various shifts will be explained gradually through this ‘course’.</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>A suggestion.</em> I have to admit, the standard stress scheme is quite complicated, even in my watered-down version. Try learning the standard stress scheme only if you want to speak roughly as news presenters on Croatian Public TV, or you really want to imitate speech from the shaded area. Otherwise, don’t bother with it, and go for the ‘western’ scheme. You’ll sound roughly like someone from the unshaded regions, which is not bad if your main goal is to communicate. Keep in mind, stress is not marked in normal writing at all.</p>\n<p>There are only couple of words that differ only by their stress, for example:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">fr<u>i</u>zer</b> <i>freezer</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">fr<u>i</u>z<u>e</u>r</b> <i>hairdresser</i>\n</p>\n<p>(Again, pay attention that both marks, for stress, and for <b class=\"hrv\">i</b>’s usually not pronounced are just my inventions: nobody uses them in writing.)</p>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_BEGIN-->\n<p>Through this small ‘course’ there will be here and there sound clips with pronunciation of selected words and sentences. When pronunciation varies, the sound clips will be marked like this:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\"><span class=\"player\"> S▶ </span></td>\n<td class=\"last\">play a clip with the standard pronunciation</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\"><span class=\"player\"> W▶ </span>  </td>\n<td class=\"last\">play a clip with the ‘western’ pronunciation</td>\n</tr></table>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_END-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_01\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_01_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_01\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>If, in a spelling system that’s essentially ‘phonetic’ (i.e. spell as you speak), somebody mixes up letters and spellings, you can immediatelly conclude there’s no difference in their speech. The best evidence many people in Croatia pronounce <b class=\"hrv\">ć</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> the same is that they often mix them up in spellings: you’ll often see it not only in casual writing, but also on web pages and signs on shops!</p>\n<p>The origins of stress shifts and tone changes in the standard stress scheme is somewhat controversial in linguistics, and has been debated for over a century.</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8398294174938963007&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8398294174938963007&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8398294174938963007&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8398294174938963007&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8398294174938963007&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/pronunciation\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\npronunciation</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/regional%20variations\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\nregional variations</span></a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</p></div>"

Let’s put these forms to use:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"tt\">jede<b class=\"ttb\">jesti</b></b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_ana_jede_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana is eating.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Marko <b class=\"tt\">piše<b class=\"ttb\">p<u>i</u>sati</b></b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_marko_pise_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i> Marko is writing.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivana <b class=\"tt\">pleše<b class=\"ttb\">pl<u>e</u>sati</b></b>.</b> <i>Ivana is dancing.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"tt\">plače<b class=\"ttb\">plakati</b></b>.</b> <i>Goran is crying.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Instead of names, you can use the following <em>pronouns</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">on</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_on_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>he</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ona</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_ona_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>she</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Ona</b> <b class=\"tt\">jede<b class=\"ttb\">jesti</b></b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_ona_jede_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>She’s eating.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">On</b> <b class=\"tt\">plače<b class=\"ttb\">plakati</b></b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_on_place_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>He’s crying.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can even leave out the pronoun if it’s obvious who you’re talking about:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Plače<b class=\"ttb\">plakati</b></b>.</b> <i>He/she is crying.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>That’s fine, but how do you say <i>I’m eating</i> or <i>I’m cooking</i>? Such sentences are in the <em>1st person</em>. Croatian does not use personal pronouns (<i>I, you...</i>) often, the preferred way is just to use a special verb form. (This is actually common in most languages: English, German and French obligatory pronoun is an exception, from the standpoint of the majority of languages in the world.)</p>\n<p>It turns out that for almost all verbs, you just need to add an <b class=\"hrv\">-m</b> to the <em>pres-3</em> form to get the <em>pres-1</em> form you now need:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Č<u>i</u>ta<b class=\"hrvc\">m</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_citam_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m reading.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kuha<b class=\"hrvc\">m</b>.</b>\n<i>I’m cooking</i>.\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>U</u>či<b class=\"hrvc\">m</b>.</b> <i>I’m studying</i>.\n</p></div>\n<p>(This is also possible in English, but only colloquially, e.g. <i>hope this helps</i>. However, the sentences above are not considered colloquial at all in Croatian! Croatian simply uses pronouns only in specific circumstances, which will be described later.)</p>\n<p>This works regardless of the verbs being ‘irregular’ or not:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv tt\">Jede<b class=\"hrvc\">m</b><b class=\"ttb\">jesti</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_jedem_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m eating.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv tt\">Piše<b class=\"hrvc\">m</b><b class=\"ttb\">p<u>i</u>sati</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_pisem_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m writing.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv tt\">Pleše<b class=\"hrvc\">m</b><b class=\"ttb\">pl<u>e</u>sati</b>.</b>\n<i>I’m dancing.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv tt\">Pije<b class=\"hrvc\">m</b><b class=\"ttb\">piti</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_pijem_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m drinking.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Since <b class=\"hrv\">pijem</b> is derived from <b class=\"hrv\">pije</b>, the pronunciation of <b class=\"hrv\">ije</b> is the same as in <b class=\"hrv\">pije</b> – it’s pronounced clearly as <em>two</em> syllables: <b class=\"hrv\">pi-jem</b>. This holds to all similar verbs as well. <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#02-ekavian\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>A Croatian dictionary could list either <em>pres-3</em> forms or <em>pres-1</em> forms for the ‘irregular’ verbs, but it’s easy to distinguish them, since they end in different letters (almost all <em>pres-1</em> forms end in an <b class=\"hrv\">-m</b>:  for just two irregular verbs they end in <b class=\"hrv\">-u</b>).</p>\n<p>We can introduce two useful words to add information to such sentences (they are both <em>adverbs</em>):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">još</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_jos_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>still</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">već</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_vec_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>already</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>We can put them in front of the verb to say that something is still ongoing or it has already started:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"hrvc\">već</b> spava.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('02_ana_vec_spava_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana is already sleeping.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"hrvc\">još</b> <b class=\"tt\">plače<b class=\"ttb\">plakati</b></b>.</b>\n<i>Goran is still crying.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The adverb <b class=\"hrv\">još</b>, when used in this role, is often emphasized as <b class=\"hrv\">još uv<s>i</s>jek</b>, giving it a bit stronger meaning:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"hrvc\">još uv<s>i</s>jek</b> <b class=\"tt\">pleše<b class=\"ttb\">pl<u>e</u>sati</b></b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is still dancing.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This is a bit colloquial. It’s usually pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">u-vjek</b>, since the <b class=\"hrv\">ije</b> does not appear at the very end (and so I marked it).</p>\n<p>If you’re now asking how to say <i>I write</i> or <i>Ana sleeps</i>, there’s no such difference in Croatian: <b class=\"hrv\">pišem</b> means both <i>I’m writing</i> and <i>I write</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Note.</em> If a verb has an irregular <em>pres-3</em>, please learn the <em>inf</em> as well, even if you don’t need it right now: you’ll need it a bit later, for the past and the future tenses.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"02-ekavian\">\n<p>® In most of Serbia, and in the prevailing variant of Standard Serbian, most words that have <b class=\"hrv\">-<s>i</s>je-</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-je-</b> in Croatian, have <b class=\"hrv\">-e-</b> instead, e.g. instead of <b class=\"hrv\">p<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>vati</b>, the verb is <b class=\"hrv\">p<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>vati</b>. That’s called <em>“Ekavian pronunciation”</em> (the name is misleading – it’s not just a matter of pronunciation, since spelling follows the pronunciation).</p>\n<p>However, forms like <b class=\"hrv\">pjevati</b>, called <em>“Ijekavian”</em> are also standard in Serbian (as another standard variant) and you can occasionally read articles written in “Ijekavian” in newspapers from Serbia. I will <em>not</em> mark all such words. In most cases, if you want to obtain them, just replace <b class=\"hrv\">-<s>i</s>je-</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-je-</b> in Croatian with <b class=\"hrv\">-e-</b>. Exceptions will be marked: one of them are present forms of the verb <b class=\"hrv\">piti</b>, which are <b class=\"hrv\">p<b class=\"hrvc\">ije</b>m</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">p<b class=\"hrvc\">ije</b></b> also in Serbia. You can find more about “Ekavian” in A9 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"A9.html\">Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin</a>.</p>\n<p>In most coastal areas of Croatia, but not in the very south (i.e. Dubrovnik area) most words that have <b class=\"hrv\">-<s>i</s>je-</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-je-</b> in Standard Croatian, have <b class=\"hrv\">-i-</b> instead, e.g. instead of <b class=\"hrv\">p<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>vati</b>, the verb is <b class=\"hrv\">p<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>vati</b>. That’s called <em>“Ikavian pronunciation”</em>. You will find it in casual writing, some novels, movies and pop songs.</p>\n</div><!-- 02-ekavian -->\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"02-kuhati\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">kuhati</b>, the form <b class=\"hrv\">kuvati</b> is used in Serbia, and in parts of Bosnia and Croatia (however, it’s <em>not standard</em> in Croatian).</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"02-plesati\">In Serbia, meaning <i>dance</i> is usually expressed with the verb <b class=\"hrv\">igrati</b> which has other meanings (<i>play</i>) in both Croatia and Serbia.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_02\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_02_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_02\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>English is a distant cousin to Croatian and related languages. This will mostly be of interest to language geeks. However, it can also help you remember things.</p>\n<p>For example, the <b class=\"hrv\">-m</b> in the Croatian 1st person is related to the English <i>I a<u>m</u></i> — thousands of years ago, a long lost language which was the common ancestor of both languages had the <b class=\"hrv\">-m</b> in the first person form of some verbs. This consonant has survived literally thousands of years.</p>\n<p><em>Russian</em> is a much closer cousin. For example, the Russian verb meaning <i>write</i> has <em>inf</em> <b class=\"hrv\">пис<u>а</u>ть</b>, and the <em>pres-3</em> <b class=\"hrv\">пишет</b>. If we would spell these words using Croatian characters, it would be <b class=\"hrv\">p’is<u>а</u>t’</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">p’išet</b>), which is almost identical to Croatian. However, the <em>pres-1</em> is <b class=\"hrv\">p’iš<u>u</u></b>. Russian has overall a bit more complex forms of words when compared to Croatian.</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<!--##QUIZ##-->\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Answ_02()\n{ var Answ=[\"zijeva\",\"Plačem\",\"već\",\"sjedi\",\"Još\",\"spavam\",\"Ona\",\"trči\",\"On\",\"već\",\"plače\"];

It means that words change a bit when used in sentences. For instance, when you express <em>what</em> you are reading or even <em>whom</em> you’re waiting for – that’s called <em>object</em>. This ‘role’ requires a form of a noun that’s usually called <em>accusative case</em> or sometimes <em>the object case</em>. Since <em>accusative</em> is a long word, it’s often shortened to just A.</p>\n<p>(<em>Nouns</em> are words standing for a more or less specific object, person or idea, something that can perform an action, e.g. <i>sister</i>, <i>cat</i>, or can be an object of an action, e.g. you can eat a <i>pizza</i>).</p>\n<p>Not all nouns change in accusative in the same way. Some don’t change at all. A large group of nouns in Croatian end in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>; they all change that ending to <b class=\"hrv\">-u</b> in accusative. For instance:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">baka</b> <i>grandmother</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jabuka</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_jabuka_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>apple</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">juha</b> <i>soup</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#03-juha\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kava</b> <i>coffee</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#03-juha\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">knjiga</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_knjiga_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>book</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mama</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_mama_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Mom</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pjesma</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_pjesma_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>song</i>\n</p></td><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">riba</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_riba_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>fish</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sestra</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_sestra_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>sister</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tata</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_tata_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Dad</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">teta</b> <i>aunt</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">telev<u>i</u>zija</b> <i>TV</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#03-televizija\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">večera</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_vecera_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>supper, late dinner</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">voda</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_voda_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>water</i>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>The default, <em>‘dictionary’</em> forms listed above are also considered a ‘grammatical case’ and are called <em>nominative</em> (just N for short).</p>\n<p>We are now able to say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana č<u>i</u>ta knjig</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_ana_cita_knjigu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana is reading a book.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kuham juh</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>I’m cooking soup.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan <b class=\"tt\">pije<b class=\"ttb\">piti</b></b>\nkav</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>Ivan is drinking coffee.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Jedem<b class=\"ttb\">jesti</b></b>\nvečer</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>I’m eating supper.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Pijem<b class=\"ttb\">piti</b></b>\nvod</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_pijem_vodu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m drinking water.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p class=\"att\"><i>Warning</i>. English prefers using ‘<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_verb\">light</a>’ or ‘generic’ verbs like <i>make</i> in many circumstances, so you usually <i>make coffee</i>, <i>make dinner</i> and so on. Croatian has almost no such verbs, and you have to use always specific verbs – for example, <b class=\"hrv\">kuhati</b> <i>cook</i> if you prepare food or drink by cooking.</p>\n<p>In sentences like <b class=\"hrv\">Ana č<u>i</u>ta knjigu</b>, the word <b class=\"hrv\">Ana</b> is called <em>subject</em>.

It’s also the most common order in Croatian, but it’s not always so, as you’ll see later.</p>\n<p>If you are now puzzled where the English <i>a</i> (in <i>a book</i>) got lost – it does not exist in Croatian, there’s no difference between <i>a book</i> and <i>the book</i> in Croatian. (I’ll show later how you can express <i>a</i> or <i>the</i> if you really need it.)</p>\n<p>The majority of verbs require just objects in accusative. For instance:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čekati</b> <i>wait</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gledati</b> <i>watch</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">imati</b> <i>have, possess</i>\n</p></td><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">slušati</b> <i>listen</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tražiti</b> <i>search, look for</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trebati</b> <i>need</i>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>Let’s put them to use:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana gleda telev<u>i</u>zij</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>Ana is watching TV.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Trebam kav</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>I need coffee.</i>\n<a href=\"#03-juha\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan čeka bak</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>Ivan is waiting for his grandmother.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Slušam pjesm</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>I’m listening to a song.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran traži knjig</b><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>Goran is looking for the book.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Unlike the English verb <i>have</i>, Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">imati</b> is a perfectly regular and simple verb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan ima knjigu.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_ivan_ima_knjigu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ivan has a book.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>While in English, verbs <i>listen</i> and <i>wait</i> use prepositions <i>to</i> and <i>for</i> (you <i>wait for something</i>), in Croatian no such special words are needed, you just use nouns in accusative. The same goes for <b class=\"hrv\">tražiti</b>.</p>\n<p>You could also see that in English we have <i>his grandmother</i> while in Croatian it’s just <b class=\"hrv\">baka</b> (in A). Words like <i>his</i>, <i>my</i>, <i>her</i> are less used in Croatian and are often implied. (English also implies possession in some circumstances: it’s enough to say <i>I’m at home</i> – it’s implied that you’re at your home, not at home that belongs to someone else. When it’s somebody else’s home, then you would say e.g. <i>I’m at your home</i>.)</p>\n<p>This change of ending applies to loanwords (that is, words taken from other languages) as well:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"c-n\">Goran</b> <b class=\"tt\">jede<b class=\"ttb\">jesti</b></b>\n<b class=\"c-a\">pizz<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b></b>.</b>\n<i>Goran is eating a pizza.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are also a few words that must adapt in English as well, depending on their role: you cannot say <i>“I’m listening to she”</i>, but <i>I’m listening to <u>her</u></i>. It’s just that in Croatian, basically all nouns must adapt.</p>\n<p>The accusative change <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">-u</b> applies to personal names as well:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan čeka An<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_ivan_ceka_anu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ivan is waiting for Ana.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran sluša Ivan<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Goran is listening to Ivana.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Therefore, personal names in Croatian have many forms, as other nouns do, and some of these forms may coincide with other names – as you will later discover. However, there’s always the base, default form – e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Ana</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Ivana</b>.</p>\n<p>Most personal names that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> in Croatian are female names. However, there are couple of male names that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> as well, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Jakša</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Luka</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Nikola</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Saša</b>. They behave exactly the same:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana traži Luk<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is looking for Luka.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are few Croatian female names that don’t end in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>: they don’t change at all, <em>ever</em>. Such names are e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Ines</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Nives</b>. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan čeka <b class=\"hrvc\">Ines</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan is waiting for Ines.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>A more exhaustive list of various names, including male names in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> and female names not in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>, can be found in L1 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"l1.html\">Common Names</a>. <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#03-names\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>(I’ll explain how to use nouns not ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>, including masculine names like <b class=\"hrv\">Ivan</b>, as objects in the following chapters.)</p>\n<p>Finally, I’ll explain <em>how to ask what someone is doing</em> (at the moment, or generally). While English has the special verb <i>do</i>, Croatian uses the verb <b class=\"hrv\">raditi</b> <i>work</i> in a generic sense. You should start such questions with the word <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> <a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_ssto_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a> <i>what</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Što</b> Ana <b class=\"hrvc\">radi</b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_sto_ana_radi_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>What is Ana doing?</i> (lit. ‘<i>working</i>’)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Gleda telev<u>i</u>ziju.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_gleda_televiziju_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>She’s watching TV.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>As you can see, there’s <em>nothing special about questions in Croatian</em>: no special word order, no special rules. You just have to start them with the right question-word. I’ve also given the literal (lit.) meaning, in quotes; of course, it really means <i>what is doing</i>.</p>\n<p>We can here answer only with a verb, no pronouns (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">ona</b> <i>she</i>) are needed, since it’s clear who we’re talking about. Generally, Croatian prefers very short answers.</p>\n<p>To <em>ask directly</em> what someone is doing, use the 2nd person form <b class=\"hrv\">radiš</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Što <b class=\"hrvc\">radiš</b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_sto_radis_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>What are you doing?</i> (to a single person!)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Č<u>i</u>tam knjigu.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_citam_knjigu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m reading a book.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This form is used <em>only</em> when you ask a single person, someone you’re familiar with, your family member, co-worker, etc; for your superiors, people you don’t know personally, other forms are used (they will be explained later).</p>\n<p>In many regions, <b class=\"hrv\">šta</b> <a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('03_sta_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a> is used colloquially instead of <b class=\"hrv\">što</b><a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#03-sto\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>, so you’ll very often read and hear <b class=\"hrv\">šta radiš</b>, etc. (try it with Google™).</p>\n<p>One more remark: there are other languages out there that have grammatical cases, and call one of them <em>accusative</em>, e.g. Finnish, German, Greek, Latin and so on. The accusative case in all languages tends to be similar, but details can be different. If you know a lot how to use the accusative case in e.g. German, be aware that not all of it applies to Croatian.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"03-juha\">® Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">kava</b>, a slightly different word <b class=\"hrv\">kafa</b> is common in most parts of Bosnia and Serbia. In Bosnia, the form <b class=\"hrv\">kahva</b> is used as well. Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">juha</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">supa</b> is common in these countries, and in some regions of Croatia as well. </p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"03-televizija\">Standard Serbian insists that the word for <i>TV</i> must be stressed as <b class=\"hrv\">tel<u>e</u>vizija</b> (you will hear it on the Serbian Public TV); regardless of it, a great majority of speakers in Serbia uses the same stress in that word as in Croatia. However, you <em>will</em> occasionally hear <b class=\"hrv\">tel<u>e</u>vizija</b> in parts of Croatia and Bosnia.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"03-names\">While many names are common in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, there are some country-specific names. Actually, there are some names that are specific for a <em>part</em> of Croatia, and uncommon elsewhere – despite the total population of Croatia being about 4 million.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"03-sto\">The form <b class=\"hrv\">šta</b> <i>what</i> is considered standard in Serbia,  and most of Bosnia. It’s very common in Croatia (including the cities of Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, etc) but not standard. It’s interesting that the form <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> is common in speech in some parts of Croatia (e.g. the city of Zadar) and in Montenegro. In Northwestern Croatia, many people colloquially use <b class=\"hrv\">kaj</b> for <i>what</i> (you can hear it in Zagreb too). In parts of the coast, especially on the islands and in Istria, another word is often used colloquially for <i>what</i>: <b class=\"hrv\">ča</b>.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_03\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_03_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_03\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>If we would pay attention to tones in words, object forms of some words would be a bit more complicated to create. For instance, the noun <b class=\"hrv\">voda</b> <i>water</i> has the rising tone in the nominative case, but the falling tone in the accusative <b class=\"hrv\">vodu</b>. However, the noun <b class=\"hrv\">riba</b> <i>fish</i> has the falling tone in all forms. This is not a major issue, since many people in Croatia have no differences in tone, or have non-standard tones anyway, so we’re used to various ‘accents’.</p>\n<p>In Russian, this is a major issue. There are no tones in Russian, but the stress often moves in various forms of one word. For instance, Russian <i>water</i> is N <b class=\"hrv\">вод<u>а</u></b>, A <b class=\"hrv\">воду</b>. When written in Croatian spelling, it’s N <b class=\"hrv\">vod<u>а</u></b>, A <b class=\"hrv\">vodu</b> – which seems identical to Croatian, but there’s a catch: since the <b class=\"hrv\">o</b> in N is unstressed, it’s pronounced reduced, much closer to the <b class=\"hrv\">a</b> sound, while in A it’s stressed and pronounced like <b class=\"hrv\">o</b>! Russian pronunciation is more complex than Croatian.</p>\n<p>The term <em>accusative</em> comes from a bad Latin translation of a Greek term – originally it had nothing with <i>accusing</i> – but it stuck.</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<!--##QUIZ##-->\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Answ_03()\n{ var

That almost never happens in the ‘western’ pronunciation, where the <em>stress almost never moves</em> in such circumstances. We could therefore write the above combination as <b class=\"hrv\">n<u>e</u>-gl<u>e</u>da</b>.</p>\n<p>If you want to follow the Standard stress scheme, how to find out if the stress moves to <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ or not? Just look if the verb has (in my markings!) any underline. This explains why I have underlined the first syllables of some verbs:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">Standard stress when <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ is before a verb</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ne</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">gleda</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">the stress moves to <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ne</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">č<u>i</u>ta</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>no shift</em>: the stress stays on <b class=\"hrv\">či</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ne</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">razg<u>o</u>v<u>a</u>ra</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>no shift</em>: the stress stays on <b class=\"hrv\">go</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>In the ‘western’ scheme, which is much simpler, the stress doesn’t even move from <b class=\"hrv\">gleda</b>. In that scheme, it moves mostly from the very short verbs, like <b class=\"hrv\">znati</b> <i>know</i>, and there’s only few of them. In the city of Rijeka and the region around it, the stress usually doesn’t move, even from such short verbs:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">Rijeka</th>\n<th>Zagreb</th>\n<th class=\"last\">Split, Osijek</th>\n</tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ne zn<u>a</u></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ne gl<u>e</u>da</b>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">n<u>e</u> zna</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ne gl<u>e</u>da</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">n<u>e</u> zna</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">n<u>e</u> gleda</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>This, however, doesn’t explain why I underlined the first vowel of <em>inf</em> in e.g. the verb <b class=\"hrv\">p<u>i</u>sati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">piše</b>) <i>write</i>; it will get useful much later.</p>\n<p>The two dots (¨) after the <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ are just a reminder that this word must be placed always right before the verb, and that it gets pronounced together with the verb; they are <em>just my markings</em>, of course they are not normally written, please don’t write them when you write in Croatian.</p>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">imati</b> <i>have</i> behaves a bit specially: its present tense forms get always <em>fused</em> with <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ into <b class=\"hrv\">nema</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">nemam</b>, etc.:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Nemam</b> čašu.</b>\n<i>I don’t have a glass.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Croatian has two words that correspond to English <i>glass</i> (to drink from, not what is used for windows) and <i>cup</i>, and they divide the world a bit differently:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">čaša</b> <i>glass</i>, <i>(paper) cup</i> (no handle)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">šalica</b> <i>cup</i>, <i>mug</i> (has a handle)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#04-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>Basically, <b class=\"hrv\">čaša</b> is made of glass or some thin material (e.g. plastic, paper) and <b class=\"hrv\">šalica</b> is heavy and has a handle.</p>\n<p>Back to negative sentences: they can mean that something is not happening <em>right now</em> or it <em>never</em> happens. If you want to emphasize that something <em>never</em> happens, you should add the following adverb in the sentence – the most common place is before the <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ – but <em>without removing</em> the negation:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">nikad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) <i>never</i> (use with negation!)\n</p>\n<p>This is <em>different</em> than in English, where you have to remove negation if you use <i>never</i>. The word can appear as either <b class=\"hrv\">nikad</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">nikada</b>, there’s no difference in meaning and the shorter form is more common in everyday communication (there are many words in Croatian with this feature). For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"hrvc\">nikad ne</b> gleda telev<u>i</u>ziju.</b>\n<i>Ana never watches TV.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Nikad ne</b>\n<b class=\"tt\">pijem<b class=\"ttb\">piti</b></b> kavu.</b>\n<i>I never drink coffee.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are more words like <b class=\"hrv\">nikad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) in Croatian: whenever any of them is used, the verb must be negated. Most of them start with <b class=\"hrv\">ni-</b>.</p>\n<p>There’s another special adverb that emphasizes the negation:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u><u>o</u>pće</b> + negation <i>not... at all</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#04-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>As in other Croatian words that have vowels without a consonant between, vowels are pronounced separately. Therefore, the word has three syllables: <b class=\"hrv\">u-op-će</b>. (Besides, the word is stressed on the first syllable in the standard scheme, and on the second syllable in the ‘western’ scheme.) For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"hrvc\"><u>u</u><u>o</u>pće ne</b> spava.</b>\n<i>Goran isn’t sleeping at all.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Futhermore, we can use the following combinations of adverbs and <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ to express that something is over or still didn’t begin:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">još</b> + negation <i>not... yet</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">više</b> + negation <i>not... anymore</i>\n</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"hrvc\">još ne</b> spava.</b>\n<i>Goran isn’t sleeping yet.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Više ne</b>\n<b class=\"tt\">pijem<b class=\"ttb\">piti</b></b> kavu.</b>\n<i>I don’t drink coffee anymore.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(It’s <em>not obligatory</em> to put the words <b class=\"hrv\">nikad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>), <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u><u>o</u>pće</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">još</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">više</b> right before <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨, that’s just the most frequent position.)</p>\n<p>It’s also useful to tell <em>how often</em> something happens. There are following useful words:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">često</b> <i>often</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">obično</b> <i>usually</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>n<u>e</u>kad</b> <i>sometimes</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">r<s>i</s>jetko</b> <i>not very often</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">stalno</b> <i>all the time</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">svaki dan</b> <i>every day</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">uv<s>i</s>jek</b> <i>always</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Such words are often placed before the verb, and <b class=\"hrv\">svaki dan</b> is often found at the end of the sentence as well. Word order is quite free in Croatian and you can place many words as you like.</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"hrvc\">r<s>i</s>jetko</b> gleda telev<u>i</u>ziju.</b>\n<i>Ana watches TV rarely.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">P<u>o</u>n<u>e</u>kad</b>\n<b class=\"tt\">pijem<b class=\"ttb\">piti</b></b> kavu.</b>\n<i>I drink coffee sometimes.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan\n<b class=\"tt\">pije<b class=\"ttb\">piti</b></b> kavu <b class=\"hrvc\">svaki dan</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan drinks coffee every day.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s another useful word: <b class=\"hrv\">skoro</b> <i>almost</i> (it has other meanings as well). Used with <b class=\"hrv\">nikad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>), it expresses <i>almost never</i>. However, you <em>still</em> have to use negation:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Skoro nikad ne</b>\n<b class=\"tt\">pijem<b class=\"ttb\">piti</b></b> kavu.</b>\n<i>I almost never drink coffee.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are more useful words. For example when you say that someone is doing something, you could be perfectly sure, or just guess. That’s where these words come into play:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">možda</b> <i>maybe</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">očito</b> <i>obviously</i><br/>\n</p></td><td class=\"last\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sigurno</b> <i>for sure</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vj<u>e</u>roj<u>a</u>tno</b> <i>probably</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#04-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>Such words are again usually put before the verb. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"hrvc\">možda</b> spava.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('04_goran_mozda_spava_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Goran is maybe sleeping.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan <b class=\"hrvc\">sigurno</b> pije kavu.</b>\n<i>Ivan is drinking coffee for sure.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are couple of words to indicate that something repeats or happens for the first time:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">opet</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">ponovo</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">ponovno</b> <i>again</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prvi put</b> <i>for the first time</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>There’s really no difference among the three words meaning <i>again</i>. The word <b class=\"hrv\">opet</b> is the most frequent one in everyday life:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"hrvc\">opet</b> spava.</b>\n<i>Ana is sleeping again.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"hrvc\">prvi put</b> č<u>i</u>ta knjigu.</b>\n<i>Goran is reading a book for the first time.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You will sometimes hear and read <b class=\"hrv\">prvi puta</b>, e.g. in newspapers. (Some people think that form is not acceptable as standard, but it can be seen in publications issued by the Croatian government!) It’s basically the same variation as <b class=\"hrv\">nikad</b> vs. <b class=\"hrv\">nikada</b>.</p>\n<p>If you are <em>asked</em> what you’re doing, and you aren’t doing anything in particular, you can answer with:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Što radiš?</b>\n<i>What are you doing?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">Ništa</b>.</b>\n<i>Nothing.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you want to use <b class=\"hrv\">ništa</b> <i>nothing</i> with a verb, the verb <em>must</em> be negated too:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan <b class=\"hrv\">često</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">ne</b> radi <b class=\"hrvc\">ništa</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan frequently does nothing.</i> (lit. ‘<i>isn’t doing nothing’</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>This is again quite unlike English. In English, there’s at most one negation in a sentence; in Croatian, it’s always either <em>all negative</em> – including the verb – or <em>nothing</em>. The following sentence negates the verb and has two additional negative words:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan <b class=\"hrvc\">nikad ne</b> radi <b class=\"hrvc\">ništa</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan never does anything.</i> (lit. ‘<i>doesn’t never do nothing’</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>Such ‘multiple negations’ in Croatian are <em>mandatory</em>.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"04-diff\">® Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">šalica</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">šolja</b> is used in Bosnia and Serbia. Instead of <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u><u>o</u>pće</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">uopšte</b> is used in Serbia and parts of Bosnia. Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">vj<u>e</u>roj<u>a</u>tno</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">vj<u>e</u>rov<u>a</u>tno</b> is common in Bosnia and Serbia, and colloquially in parts of Croatia.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_04\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_04_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_04\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ is <em><u>ne</u>gative</em>.

You can just leave the stress on the noun, but be prepared to hear the stress moved from some speakers (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">vodu</b> = <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u> vodu</b>.)<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-stress\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>While English <i>leave</i> usually uses <i>for</i> instead of <i>to</i>, Croatian verbs use the same prepositions.</p>\n<p>The expression <b class=\"hrv\">ide u školu</b> can mean somebody is a school student, i.e. ‘goes to school’:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> škol<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Goran goes to school.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>However, if you go to an <i>island</i> or <i>mountain</i>, you must use the preposition <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ instead of <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨. There are names of bigger Croatian islands:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Brač</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Cres</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_cres_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hvar</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_hvar_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Korčula</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Krk</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_krk_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">L<u>o</u>š<u>i</u>nj</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pag</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Rab</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vis</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"tt\">p<u>u</u>tuje<b class=\"ttb\">put<u>o</u>vati</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> Krk.</b>\n<i>Ana is traveling to the island of Krk.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>O</u>dl<u>a</u>zim <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> Korčul<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>I’m leaving for the island of Korčula.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, this applies to the following nouns as well:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">otok</b> <i>island</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">plan<u>i</u>na</b> <i>mountain</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The preposition <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ is used for all destinations that are perceived as <em>surfaces</em>, or when the destination is <em>on top</em> – it’s usually translated as <i>onto</i> or <i>on</i>: you would use it for <i>roofs</i>, <i>tabletops</i>, <i>walls</i>, etc.</p>\n<p>Next, it would be great if we could say not just <i>I’m...</i> but also <i>we’re</i>! It’s quite simple: Croatian again prefers not to use personal pronouns (<i>I</i>, <i>we</i>...) but a special verb form, <em>1st person plural present</em> (for short, <em>pres-1pl</em>). It’s a form quite simple to make, just add an <b class=\"hrv\">-o</b> to the <em>pres-1</em> form (one that ends in a <b class=\"hrv\">-m</b>):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">idem</b> <i>I’m going</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">idem</b><b class=\"hrvc\">o</b> <i>we’re going</i>\n</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">P<u>u</u>tujem<b class=\"hrvc\">o</b><b class=\"ttb\">put<u>o</u>vati</b></b> na L<u>o</u>š<u>i</u>nj.</b>\n<i>We’re traveling to the island of Lošinj.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>O</u>dl<u>a</u>zim<b class=\"hrvc\">o</b> u Am<u>e</u>riku.</b>\n<i>We’re leaving for America.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The preposition <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ also applies to the following popular destinations:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">plaža</b> <i>beach</i><br/>\n</p></td><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trg</b> <i>(city) square</i><br/>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Idemo<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> plažu.</b>\n<i>We’re going to the beach.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The preposition <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ <em>must</em> be used with the <em>cardinal points</em> when used as directions:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sjever</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_sjever_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>north</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zapad</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_zapad_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>west</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">istok</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_istok_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>east</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jug</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_jug_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>south</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">P<u>u</u>tujemo<b class=\"ttb\">put<u>o</u>vati</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">na jug</b>.</b>\n<i>We’re traveling south.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The preposition <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ is used with many <em>metaphorical</em> destinations (or rather, activities):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na fak<u>u</u>lt<u>e</u>t</b> <i>to university</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na more</b> <i>to the seaside</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na posao</b> <i>to work</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na praznike</b> <i>to holidays</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na put</b> <i>on a trip</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na selo</b> <i>to countryside</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(I’ve listed nouns in the phrases above in the accusative case; the form <b class=\"hrv\">praznike</b> is in accusative plural, a form that will be explained later.) For instance:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> posao.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_ana_ide_na_posao_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana is going to work.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Idemo<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> more.</b>\n<i>We’re going to the seaside.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Some of these destinations can be used also with <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ – it makes their meaning literal, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">u more</b> means <em>literally</em> into the sea, to swim or dive, throwing something into the sea, etc. Nouns that require the <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ are marked in the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"/p/d0.html\">Core Dictionary</a>.)</p>\n<p>The metaphorical <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ includes all ‘activities’, such as meals, meetings and sport events:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na čaj</b> <i>to have a tea</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na kavu</b> <i>to have a coffee</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na k<u>o</u>nc<u>e</u>rt</b> <i>to a concert</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na nogomet</b> <i>to football game</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na odmor</b> <i>to vacation/break</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na pivo</b> <i>to have a beer</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na ples</b> <i>to dance</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na ručak</b> <i>to lunch</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na sastanak</b> <i>to a meeting</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na večeru</b> <i>to supper</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>When you say <b class=\"hrv\">na kavu</b>, it <em>requires motion</em> to a destination (where you will have a coffee or more than one), not just drinking coffee wherever you are. The ‘destination’ <b class=\"hrv\">na nogomet</b> means <em>both</em> playing football or just watching a game (this applies to other sports and public performances as well).</p>\n<p>The same holds for celebrations and parties:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na feštu</b> <i>to a local feast/party</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na rođendan</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_na_rodjendan_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>to a birthday party</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na zabavu</b> <i>to a party</i>\n</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Idem<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> kavu.</b>\n<i>I’m going to have a coffee.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Idemo<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> sastanak.</b>\n<i>We’re going to a meeting.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If it’s a bit confusing what ‘activities’ are, they are simply not <em>literally</em> places. Consider this:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first\">\nnot true places\n</th><th class=\"last\">true places\n</th></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>concert</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>concert hall</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>dinner</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>restaurant</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>football</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>playground</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>meeting</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>meeting room</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>movie premiere</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>cinema</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Finally, the ‘destination’ <b class=\"hrv\">na sunce</b> usually doesn’t imply taking a spaceship, but rather going to an open space, to get exposed to the sunlight:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na sunce</b> <i>in the sun</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na zrak</b> <i>to</i> (<i>fresh</i>) <i>air</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td></tr></table>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p><em>Pay attention</em>: everything I’ve explained here are <em>destinations</em>, and not <em>locations</em>. If you say <b class=\"hrv\">idemo na plažu</b>, you aren’t describing where the action takes place, but where you’re <em>heading to</em> (and you may get there or not). To help you distinguish locations vs destinations, consider the following sentences:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>I’m running to the gym.</i><br/>\n(You <u>aren’t</u> in the gym,<br/>just want to get there.)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n= a <em>destination</em>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>I’m running in the gym.</i><br/>\n(You <u>are</u> in the gym,<br/>and running there.)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n= a <em>location</em>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>If you feel that the word <i>to</i> is a better fit in English, it’s definitely a destination. Confusingly, English uses <i>on</i> in e.g. <i>going on vacation</i>, when you’re actually <em>not</em> on vacation yet – but Croatian treats this case as a destination too. While English sometimes uses the same grammar for both, <em>Croatian strongly distinguishes destinations from locations</em>.</p>\n<p>So, what about <em>locations</em>? You will have to wait a while, since we have to learn another noun form to express them. Destinations come cheap, if you know how to make the accusative case.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The sentences above can be made more precise if we add one of the following useful <em>adverbs of time</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) <i>now</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">danas</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_danas_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>today</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sutra</b> <i>tomorrow</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-sutra\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">uskoro</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_uskoro_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>soon</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">prekosutra</b> <i>day after tomorrow</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sljedeće godine</b> <i>next year</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sljedeći mjesec</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_sljedeci_mjesec_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>next month</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sljedeći tjedan</b> <i>next week</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(As in English, you can talk about events in future and still use the present tense.) Such words and expressions are often used to begin sentence with:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Sutra</b> <b class=\"tt\">idem<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b>\nna sastanak.</b>\n<i>I’m going to a meeting tomorrow.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Danas</b> <b class=\"tt\">idemo<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b>\nu kino.</b>\n<i>We’re going to cinema today.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Sljedeće godine</b>\n<b class=\"tt\">p<u>u</u>tujemo<b class=\"ttb\">put<u>o</u>vati</b></b> na Hvar.</b>\n<i>We’re traveling to the island of Hvar next year.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Finally, there are the following often used <em>generic directions</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">blizu</b> <i>close, near</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dal<u>e</u>ko</b> <i>far away</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dalje</b> <i>further, away</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>n<u>u</u>tra</b> <i>inside</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>v<u>a</u>mo</b> <i>here</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">natrag</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">nazad</b> <i>back</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">van</b> <i>outside</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tamo</b> / <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>n<u>a</u>mo</b> <i>there</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana uskoro d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u>v<u>a</u>mo</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is coming here soon.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>To <i>ask where to</i> something or someone goes/travels, just start a question with:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">kamo</b> <i>where... to</i>\n</p>\n<p>Nothing else except this word is needed, there’s no change of word order:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Kamo</b> Ana <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('06_kamo_ana_ide_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Where is Ana going to?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Na posao.</b>\n<i>To work.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"tt\">Ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> na posao.</b>\n<i>She’s going to work.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s normal to answer with just a destination, leaving the verb out; you can include the verb if you want to emphasize it. In colloquial communication, especially in some regions, you will hear e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">gdje</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">kuda</b> instead of <b class=\"hrv\">kamo</b> in such questions.<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#06-kamo\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the accusative case is <em>not</em> used only for objects. In fact, almost all cases in Croatian have more than one use. If you find somewhere on the Internet a table where each case has one use, and even better, where each case “answers to questions”, bear in mind that explains only a small part of the real use. I will introduce other uses of accusative gradually.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"06-vocab\">\n<p>® The following words or phrases are usually not used Serbia and most of Bosnia; words or phrases pointed by arrows are used instead:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kava</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">kafa</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kino</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">bioskop</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nogomet</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">fudbal</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">otok</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">ostrvo</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">van</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">napolje</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zrak</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">vazduh</b><br/>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sljedeći tjedan</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">sljedeće nedjelje</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">sljedeće sedmice</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>In Bosnia, in parts where Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) live, <b class=\"hrv\">kahva</b> is used for <i>coffee</i> as well.</p>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">napolje</b> is heard in parts of Croatia as well.</p>\n</div><!-- vocab -->\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"06-stress\">The stress moves to prepositions like <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ and <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ – only with specific nouns! – in Bosnia, parts of Croatia (Dalmatia and Slavonia), and western parts of Serbia (not including Belgrade) and western parts of Montenegro.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"06-sutra\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">sutra</b>, a slightly different form, <b class=\"hrv\">sjutra</b>, is used in Montenegro.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"06-kamo\">In Bosnia and Serbia, <b class=\"hrv\">kuda</b> is usually used to ask for destinations, <b class=\"hrv\">kamo</b> is not used.

All these languages descend from Latin, which had a lot of similarities with Croatian (and other Slavic languages). For example, <i>we’re eating</i> is <em>edimus</em> in Latin, while <i>we’re sitting</i> is <em>sedēmus</em> (compare it with Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">jedemo</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">sjedimo</b>).</p>\n<p>It’s puzzling that some languages usually not considered related to Croatian have similar forms: for example, in Finnish, <i>we’re eating</i> is <em>syömme</em>,

Such statements are often used for weather conditions.</p>\n<p>In English, such sentences use ‘dummy’ <i>it</i> and the 3rd person present of the verb <i>to be</i> (<i>is</i>), and that’s mostly shortened to <i>it’s</i>.</p>\n<!-- audio clips; hosted at OpenDrive.com -->\n<audio id=\"08_dosadno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE3NF8/ec_dosadno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_hladno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE3M18/ec_hladno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_kasno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE3Ml8/ec_kasno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_lijepo_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMTc1NzUzMl8/ec_lijepo_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_mracno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE3MV8/ec_mracno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_oblacno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE3MF8/ec_oblacno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_rano_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2OF8/ec_rano_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_suncano_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2N18/ec_suncano_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_toplo_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2Nl8/ec_toplo_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_vedro_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2NV8/ec_vedro_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_vruce_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2NF8/ec_vruce_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_zabavno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2M18/ec_zabavno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_malo_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2MF8/ec_malo_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_jako_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE1OV8/ec_jako_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_vrlo_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE1OF8/ec_vrlo_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_prilicno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE1N18/ec_prilicno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_dosta_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE5MV8/ec_dosta_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_stvarno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE5MF8/ec_stvarno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_hladno_je_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMTY2NTExNl8/ec_hladno_je_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_danas_je_hladno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2Ml8/ec_danas_je_hladno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_hladno_je_danas_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE2MV8/ec_hladno_je_danas_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_uzasno_je_dosadno_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE4OV8/ec_uzasno_je_dosadno_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_pada_kisa_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE4Nl8/ec_pada_kisa_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_puse_vjetar_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE4NV8/ec_puse_vjetar_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_ovdje_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE4OF8/ec_ovdje_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<audio id=\"08_svugdje_s\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMzYwMzE4N18/ec_svugdje_s.mp3\"></audio>\n<p>In Croatian, <em>no pronouns</em> can be used in such sentences, only the 3rd pers. present of the Croatian version of the verb <i>to be</i>. It’s quite irregular:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>² +) <i>be</i>\n</p>\n<p>I have written a plus sign after <b class=\"hrv\">je</b> to indicate that other present tense forms cannot be obtained by the usual rules – the forms of this verb must be learned, as in English. (For example, the 1st person form isn’t \"<b class=\"hrv\">jem</b>\" but <b class=\"hrv\">sam</b>.)</p>\n<p>There are useful words (called <em>adverbs</em>) that can be used with <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² in such expressions:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dosadno</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_dosadno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>boring</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">hladno</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_hladno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>cold</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kasno</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_kasno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>late</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_lijepo_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>beautiful</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mračno</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_mracno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>dark</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">oblačno</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_oblacno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>cloudy</i><br/>\n</p></td><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">rano</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_rano_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>early</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sunčano</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_suncano_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>sunny</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">toplo</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_toplo_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>warm</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vedro</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_vedro_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>clear</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vruće</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_vruce_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>hot</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zabavno</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_zabavno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>entertaining</i><br/>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>There’s another important point: as you can probably see from the mark ², the word <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² behaves like <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² and wants to be at the second place:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hladno <b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_hladno_je_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>It’s cold.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Danas <b class=\"hrvc\">je</b> hladno.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_danas_je_hladno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>It’s cold today.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hladno <b class=\"hrvc\">je</b> danas.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_hladno_je_danas_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n(the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>Word order in Croatian is quite free – as you can see, words <b class=\"hrv\">hladno</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">danas</b> can be exchanged – but it does not apply to some words like <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² and <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² that <em>must</em> go to a predefined place in a sentence! (Therefore, I have introduced a special mark for such words in 7 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"7.html\">Verbs with Obligatory Objects</a>.)</p>\n<p>The adverb <b class=\"hrv\">vedro</b> is opposite of <b class=\"hrv\">oblačno</b> – it means the skies are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"adv_of_inten\">There are a couple of useful words (<em>adverbs of intensity</em>) that can be placed before adverbs above, and a <em>prefix</em> (not a separate word, but something that gets fused with the word following it):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">malo</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_malo_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>a bit</i> <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jako</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_jako_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>very</i> (not formal)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#08-jako\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrlo</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_vrlo_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>very</i> (more formal)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prilično</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_prilicno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>considerably</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dosta</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_dosta_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>quite</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">stvarno</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_stvarno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>really</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> <i>too</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>They must not be placed after the adverb, and are usually placed right before it. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Danas je\n<b class=\"hrvc\">jako</b> hladno.</b>\n<i>It’s very cold today.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Jako</b> je\nhladno danas.</b>\n(the same, less common order)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pr<u>e</u></b>vr<u>u</u>će\nje.</b>\n<i>It’s too hot.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The adverb <b class=\"hrv\">vrlo</b> is a bit formal, it’s mostly used in formal writing, it’s less often heard in spoken communication.</p>\n<p>In the Standard stress scheme, when <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> is added to a word, the stress shifts to it; in the ‘western’ scheme, it doesn’t: therefore <b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>e</u>vr<u>u</u>će</b>. You will sometimes see the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pre</b> spelled as a separate word: that’s not standard.</p>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p>While <b class=\"hrv\">jako</b> <i>very</i> – and other adverbs of intensity – can be used as the equivalent English words in most cases, there’s a notable exception: they can’t be used before <b class=\"hrv\">uskoro</b> <i>soon</i> – another word is normally used instead:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">rano</b> <i>early</i><br/>\n    ↓<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jako rano</b> <i>very early</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dosta rano</b> <i>quite early</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">uskoro</b> <i>soon</i> (also <b class=\"hrv\">ubrzo</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">brzo</b>) <br/>\n    ↓<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jako</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">brzo</b> <i>very soon</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dosta</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">brzo</b> <i>quite soon</i><br/></td></tr>\n</table>\n</div><!-- att -->\n<p>There are two more <em>adverbs of intensity</em> often used in colloquial, spoken communication:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"nopad\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">strašno</b>  <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">užasno</b>\n</td><td class=\"brack nopad\"> \n</td><td class=\"vcent\">  <i>terribly</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Užasno</b> je dosadno.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_uzasno_je_dosadno_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>It’s terribly boring.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>What if you want to say <i>it’s not cold</i>? The rule is a bit different than for ordinary verbs: you should add <b class=\"hrv\">ni-</b> to the front of <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>². The resulting word – <b class=\"hrv\">nije</b> – is <em>not</em> restricted to the second position and is, in fact, usually placed before the adverb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Nije</b> hladno.</b>\n<i>It isn’t cold.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>U</u><u>o</u>pće <b class=\"hrvc\">nije</b> hladno.</b>\n<i>It isn’t cold at all.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Danas <b class=\"hrvc\">nije</b> hladno.</b>\n<i>It isn’t cold today.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Nije</b> hladno danas.</b>\n(the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>There are useful words to express <em>where</em> your statement applies:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ovdje</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_ovdje_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>here</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">svugdje</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_svugdje_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>everywhere</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tamo</b> <i>there</i><br/>\n</p></td><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tu</b> <i>here</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>n<u>u</u>tra</b> <i>inside</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vani</b> <i>outside</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#08-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>In everyday, colloquial communication, <b class=\"hrv\">ovdje</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">tu</b> are used in the same meaning. These words are often put to the front of sentences:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Ovdje</b> je toplo.</b>\n<i>It’s warm here.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Vani</b> je oblačno.</b>\n<i>It’s cloudy outside.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you want to say <i>it’s raining</i> or <i>it’s snowing</i>, normally you should use the following verb:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">padati</b> <i>fall</i>\n</p>\n<p>And these nouns:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kiša</b> <i>rain</i>\n</p></td><td><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sn<s>i</s>jeg</b> <i>snow</i>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>Therefore, you actually say (in Croatian) <i>the rain is falling</i> or <i>the snow is falling</i>. Words can go in any order, and it’s actually more common to put the verb at front:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pada kiša.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_pada_kisa_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>‘Rain is falling.’</i> = <i>It’s raining.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kiša pada.</b>\n(the same meaning)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pada sn<s>i</s>jeg.</b>\n<i>‘Snow is falling.’</i> = <i>It’s snowing.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sn<s>i</s>jeg pada.</b>\n(the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>(Don’t forget <b class=\"hrv\"><s>i</s>je</b> in <b class=\"hrv\">sn<s>i</s>jeg</b> is pronounced by most people in Croatia as just <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>, according to the normal pronunciation rules outlined before.)</p>\n<p>There’s a similar expression about wind, using the noun <b class=\"hrv\">vjetar</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">vjetr-</b>) <i>wind</i> and the following verb:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">puhati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">puše</b>) <i>blow</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#08-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>Again, words can go in any order, but the verb comes often at front:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Puše<b class=\"ttb\">puhati</b></b> vjetar.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('08_puse_vjetar_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>The wind is blowing.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vjetar <b class=\"tt\">puše<b class=\"ttb\">puhati</b></b>.</b>\n(the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>When it’s obvious what you’re talking about, you can use just a verb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pada.</b>\n<i>‘It’s falling.’</i> (either rain or snow).\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Puše<b class=\"ttb\">puhati</b></b>.</b>\n<i>The wind is blowing.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can use adverbs of intensity (except for <b class=\"hrv\">vrlo</b>) to express intensity of rain, snow and wind:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Malo pada.</b>\n<i>‘It’s falling a bit.’</i> (either rain or snow).\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Jako <b class=\"tt\">puše<b class=\"ttb\">puhati</b></b>.</b>\n<i>The wind is blowing strong.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The adverb <b class=\"hrv\">jako</b> with expressions for rain, wind and snow also corresponds to English <i>heavily</i>. You can use the same adverbs (but not <b class=\"hrv\">vrlo</b>!) to express intensity of any action where it makes sense:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Jako volim čokol<u>a</u>du.</b>\n<i>I ‘strongly’ love chocolate.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>In Croatian, you can usually use the present tense to talk about future events (like in English <i>we’re leaving tomorrow</i>). However, with weather expressions, you cannot use the present tense in such a way (it’s hard to do it in English as well). However, you can use <em>adverbs of frequency</em> to talk about things that happen anytime:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Često <b class=\"tt\">puše<b class=\"ttb\">puhati</b></b> vjetar.</b>\n<i>The wind blows often.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you want to <em>ask</em> about the weather, you should use:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Kakvo</b> je vr<s>i</s>jeme?</b>\n<i>What’s the weather like?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Hladno.</b>\n<i>Cold.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It can be answered with just an adverb, as above. Such <em>short comments</em> are normal in casual, even in formal communication. It’s also possible to comment on any such sentence:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Stvarno je vruće...</b>\n<i>It’s really hot...</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Nije jako.</b>\nlit. <i>‘Not very.’</i> = <i>It isn’t very hot.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>In Croatian, short comments contain only the difference to what the comment is on. For example, since it’s a comment on <b class=\"hrv\">vruće</b>, it’s not necessary to repeat that word.</p>\n<p>If you want to ask a more generic questions, that can be answered with ‘boring’, you should ask just:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako je?</b> <i>How is it?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"08-jako\">® In Bosnia and Serbia, the adverb <b class=\"hrv\">mnogo</b> is used in meaning <i>very</i> as well; for instance, you can hear and read <b class=\"hrv\">mnogo je hladno</b> in these countries.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"08-vocab\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">vani</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">napolju</b> prevails in Bosnia and Serbia, and is also occasionally heard in parts of Croatia. Besides <b class=\"hrv\">puhati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">puše</b>), <b class=\"hrv\">duvati</b> is also used in Serbia.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_08\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_08_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_08\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>You’ll maybe come across two Croatian verbs which work exactly like the English verbs <i>rain</i> and <i>snow</i>: <b class=\"hrv\">kišiti</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">sn<s>i</s>j<u>e</u>žiti</b>.

If you want to say that something happens or will happen at some time, use just <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ + number that specifies the hour:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> tri.</b> <i>The train comes at three o’clock.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#09-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can, as in English, use the present tense for things that will happen in the near future, especially if their time is known.</p>\n<p>To specify where a train/bus/airplane is going to, use the preposition <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ + A (specifying the destination) just after the noun meaning train/bus/airplane:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> R<s>i</s>jek<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> <u>o</u>dl<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> pet.</b> <i>The train to Rijeka leaves at five o’clock.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Aut<u>o</u>bus <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> Split <u>o</u>dl<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> sedam.</b> <i>The bus to Split leaves at seven o’clock.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can use <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ + A instead of <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ + A when you express destination of travel by a vehicle:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">P<u>u</u>tujemo <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> R<s>i</s>jek<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b> <i>We’re travelling to Rijeka.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p class=\"att\">The use of <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ + A when traveling by vehicle is <em>optional</em> – you can use normal <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ + A or <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + A – however, in expressions like <i>train to Split</i>, <i>bus to Pula</i>, use of <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ is <em>mandatory</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to use more precise time, you can specify minutes:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi u tri <b class=\"hrvc\">i</b> dvadeset.</b> <i>The train arrives at 3:20.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Officially, Croatian uses 24-hour system, that is, 3 pm is 15:00. In schedules, and <b class=\"hrv\">radno vr<s>i</s>jeme</b> <i>working hours</i>, time is usually shown as <b class=\"red\">15:20</b> or <b class=\"red\">15.20</b>, sometimes with appended <b class=\"hrv\">h</b>. Sometimes, in handwriting, time is written as <b class=\"red\">15<sup><u>20</u></sup></b>, that is, with minutes in superscript:</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/8P2sc6k/ec-rv1.jpg\" width=\"200px\"/>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/JmxrX1d/ec-rv2.jpg\" width=\"200px\"/>\n</p>\n<p>Colloquially, people would just use <b class=\"hrv\">tri</b> 3 even without telling is it in the morning or afternoon.</p>\n<p>To <em>ask</em> what the time is, use the following expression. It’s normal in Croatian to give a quite short answer:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kol<u>i</u>ko je sati?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('09_koliko_je_sati_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>What’s the time?</i> (lit. <i>‘How many hours is it?’</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Tri i dvadeset.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('09_3_i_20_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>It’s 20 minutes past three.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Šest.</b>\n<i>Six o’clock.</i></p></div>\n<p>Such <em>short, basic answers</em> or <em>short comments</em> are very common in speech, and I will explain them regularly. They are <em>not</em> impolite.</p>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">kol<u>i</u>ko</b> is also frequently pronounced with stress on the first syllable (<b class=\"hrv\">koliko</b>).</p>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">skoro</b> can be used before any time (or more generally, any <em>measure</em>). For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kol<u>i</u>ko je sati?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('09_koliko_je_sati_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>What’s the time?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">Skoro</b> pet.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('09_skoro_5_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Almost five.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(It’s interesting that Standard Croatian prefers another word, <b class=\"hrv\">gotovo</b>, instead of <b class=\"hrv\">skoro</b> which completely prevails in speech and casual writing!)</p>\n<p>It’s, of course, possible to ask <em>when</em> something will happen; to ask, just put the following word to beginning of a sentence, nothing else is needed:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">kad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) <i>when</i>\n</p>\n<p>For example (you should always include a preposition when you answer such questions):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Kada</b> d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi vlak za Os<s>i</s>jek?</b>\n<i>When does the train to Osijek arrive?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">U</b> četiri i dvadeset.</b>\n<i>At 20 minutes past four.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are two common <em>adverbs</em> you can use with time expressions:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">tek</b> <i>not earlier than, only</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">već</b> <i>already, as early as</i>\n</p>\n<p>The adverbs relate to <em>expectations</em>: <b class=\"hrv\">tek</b> is <i>having more time</i> than one would expect, while <b class=\"hrv\">već</b> is <i>having less time</i> than one would expect (i.e. <i>already, as early as</i>). For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">već</b> u dva.</b>\n<i>The train arrives <u>as early as</u> two o’clock.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">tek</b> u osam.</b>\n<i>The train arrives <u>not sooner than</u> at eight o’clock.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>These two words normally cannot be placed after the words standing for time (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">u dva</b>).</p>\n<p>If you don’t know the precise time, you can use the preposition <b class=\"hrv\">oko</b>¨ instead of <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">oko</b> dva.</b>\n<i>The train arrives around two o’clock.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>A short answer to the previous question could be:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">Oko</b> dva.</b> <i>Around two o’clock.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you want to emphasize that some time is <em>exact</em>, add <b class=\"hrv\">točno</b> <i>exactly</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#09-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a> before the usual expression:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">točno</b> u tri.</b>\n<i>The train arrives at exactly 3 o’clock.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are words for <i>noon</i> and <i>midnight</i>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">podne</b> <i>noon</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ponoć</b> <i>midnight</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Again, use <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ + A to specify something happening <em>at</em> that time (for both words A = N):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Aut<u>o</u>bus</b>ʷ¹ <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>dl<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc\">u podne</b>.</b> <i>The bus leaves at noon.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can simply say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ponoć je.</b>\n<i>It’s midnight.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sad je podne.</b>\n<i>It’s noon.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Točno je podne.</b>\n<i>It’s exactly noon.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, the word <b class=\"hrv\">sad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) is optional. The word <b class=\"hrv\">točno</b> cannot be right before the time here, since they don’t make a closely connected expression, so the word <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² occupies the second position. You cannot use any personal pronouns in such sentences; in fact, <b class=\"hrv\">podne</b> serves as the subject.</p>\n<p>What if you want to tell it’s <i>almost midnight</i>, or <i>already midnight</i>? Again the word <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² will come between two words:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Skoro je ponoć.</b>\n<i>It’s almost midnight.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Već je ponoć.</b>\n<i>It’s already midnight.</i> (it came earlier than expected)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Tek je podne.</b>\n<i>It’s only noon.</i> (not later)\n</p></div>\n<p>As you can see, <b class=\"hrv\">već</b> here really means you have <em>less time available</em> (you lost track of time, and expected it’s only 11 or so). The same happens when it’s used with time references in the future, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">već u dva</b> <i>at 2 o’clock already</i> – you expected it leaves later, you have <em>less time available</em> than you expected. Such expressions are very common in Croatian (Google™ for <b class=\"hrv\">\"već je podne\"</b>)</p>\n<p>Of course, the same holds if you use <b class=\"hrv\">pet</b> 5 instead of <b class=\"hrv\">ponoć</b>, etc.</p>\n<p>Colloquially, time is often expressed in <em>halves</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Brod d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi u tri <b class=\"hrvc\">i pol</b>.</b> <i>The ship comes at half past three.</i> (<i>‘three and a half’</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>(In colloquial speech, there are several quite different ways to express time by halves and quarters, and there are different ways according to region; see the chapter on <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"i1.html\">Variations: Colloquial and Formal</a>).</p>\n<p>Here are <em>days of week</em> in Croatian:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pon<u>e</u>djeljak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pon<u>e</u>djeljk-</b>) <i>Monday</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">utorak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">utork-</b>) <i>Tuesday</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sr<s>i</s>jeda</b> <i>Wednesday</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">četv<u>r</u>tak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">četv<u>r</u>tk-</b>) <i>Thursday</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">petak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">petk-</b>) <i>Friday</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">subota</b> <i>Saturday</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nedjelja</b> <i>Sunday</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>The week always starts on Monday.

      "title": "EC: 10 Gender",
      "html": "\n<p>Gender of words for people normally matches their natural sex (there are some exceptions, though). Consequently, many terms represented by only one noun in English have <em>two</em> nouns in Croatian: one for male and one for female (the same holds in Romance languages like French, Italian or Spanish):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>male</th>\n<th class=\"last\">female</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">English</td>\n<td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">           <i>friend</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">French</td>\n<td><i>ami</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>amie</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">Spanish</td>\n<td><i>amigo</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>amiga</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">Croatian</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">prijatelj</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">prijat<u>e</u>ljica</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>In Croatian, main words that must adapt to noun gender are <em>adjectives</em> – words that indicate properties like <i>big</i>, <i>red</i>. In Croatian, adjectives also include words like <i>my</i> and <i>Ivan’s</i>. They all <em>must</em> adapt to noun gender <i>and</i> case.</p>\n<p>So, what forms of adjectives do we need to use in each gender? In simple sentences like <i>the house is big</i>, nominative forms of adjectives are used, and they are very simple:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">gender</th>\n<th>adj. N</th>\n<th class=\"last\">example</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">feminine</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-a</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">velik<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b> riba</b> <i>big fish</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">neuter</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-o</b> (some <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">velik<b class=\"hrvc\">o</b> jezero</b> <i>big lake</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masculine</td>\n<td>optionally <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">velik</b>(<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">stol</b> <i>big table</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#10-stol\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>You probably notice that there are two possible endings for the neuter gender. Most adjectives use <b class=\"hrv\">-o</b>; adjectives that need <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b> will be shown a bit later. Here’s a list of often used adjectives:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">brz</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('10_brz_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>fast</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čist</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('10_cist_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>clean</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dug</b> <i>long</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gotov</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('10_gotov_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>ready, done</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jak</b> <i>strong</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jeftin</b> <i>cheap</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jep</b> <i>nice, beautiful</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mali</b> <i>small, little</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mlad</b> <i>young</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nov</b> <i>new</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poznat</b> <i>well-known</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pun</b> <i>full</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">slab</b> <i>weak</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">skup</b> <i>expensive</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">slan</b> <i>salty</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">spor</b> <i>slow</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">star</b> <i>old</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">suh</b> <i>dry</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#10-suh\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">velik</b> <i>big</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zdrav</b> <i>healthy, in good health</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>We can use them to assemble sentences like these:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Riba je velik<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('10_riba_je_velika_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>The fish is big.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Velik<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b> riba <b class=\"tt\">jede<b class=\"ttb\">jesti</b></b> kruh.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('10_velika_riba_jede_kruh_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>The big fish is eating bread.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#10-kruh\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sunce nije jak<b class=\"hrvc\">o</b>.</b>\n<i>The sun isn’t strong.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana je zdrav<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is healthy.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Rest<u>o</u>r<u>a</u>n nije skup.</b>\n<i>The restaurant isn’t expensive.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can see that adjectives got an <b class=\"hrv\">-o</b> regardless of nouns having the final <b class=\"hrv\">-o</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b>: it’s only gender that matters, and <b class=\"hrv\">sunce</b> is neuter.</p>\n<p>In Croatian (like in other Slavic and Romance languages) adjectives <em>always</em> adapt to the noun, even if they are not right next to the noun. In German, adjectives in sentences like <i>The fish is big</i>, so-called <em>predicates</em>, don’t adapt. That’s one detail where Croatian requires words to change and German doesn’t.</p>\n<p>This makes pronouns mostly redundant, and consequently not used, as in e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">zdrava je</b> <i>she is healthy</i>, where <i>she</i> is implied by the form of the adjective.<p>\n<p>Of course, some adjectives have certain complications! There are four adjectives that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-ok</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ek</b>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dalek</b> <i>far, distant</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dubok</b> <i>deep</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">širok</b> <i>wide</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">visok</b> <i>high, tall</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>They behave in a special way ‒ <em>only in the standard stress scheme</em>: when used as <em>predicates</em> ‒ that is, when we say ‘X <i>is</i> (<i>not</i>) <i>deep</i>/<i>wide</i>’ ‒ they shift their stress in feminine and neuter genders to <b class=\"hrv\">-ok</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ek</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Visok je.</b> <i>He’s tall.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vis<u><b class=\"hrvc\">o</b></u>kaʷ¹ je.</b> <i>She’s tall.</i> (standard scheme: stress shift)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Jezero je dub<u><b class=\"hrvc\">o</b></u>koʷ¹.</b>\n<i>The lake is deep.</i> (standard scheme: stress shift)\n</p></div>\n<p>This <em>does not happen</em> in the ‘western’ stress scheme, so I marked these words with superscript W1, meaning \"stress on the first syllable in the ‘western’ scheme\". I will not specially mark these adjectives, as adjectives that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-ok</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ek</b> behave like that.</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Pay attention</em> that in Croatian, <b class=\"hrv\">kuća</b> <i>house</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">pizza</b> are also <i>she</i>, so <b class=\"hrv\">vis<u>o</u>kaʷ¹ je</b> could be a statement about a <i>house</i>!</p>\n<p>It’s possible to put the adjective first in sentences \"X is Y\", which emphasizes it:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Dub<u>o</u>koʷ¹</b> je jezero.</b>\n<i>The lake is deep.</i> (really <i>deep</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>Neuter forms of adjectives are common in <em>stand-alone signs</em>. For example, you’ll often see neuter forms <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>tv<u>o</u>reno</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">z<u>a</u>tv<u>o</u>reno</b> on shops, meaning <i>open</i> and <i>closed</i>, respectively.</p>\n<p>One more detail is still not answered: adjectives have an <em>optional</em> <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in the masculine gender. It’s not used when you use adjectives on their own (i.e. as a <em>predicate</em>), but it’s usually used when an adjective is placed before a noun (i.e. as an <em>attribute</em>):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hrast je star.</b> <i>The oak is old.</i> (predicate)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Star<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b> hrast još <b class=\"tt\">raste<b class=\"ttb\">rasti</b></b>.</b>\n<i>The old oak is still growing.</i> (attribute)\n</p></div>\n<p>We have here used the verb <b class=\"hrv\">rasti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">raste</b>) <i>grow</i>; the verb is not used to <i>grow something</i> (i.e. <i>cultivate</i>).</p>\n<p>Some adjectives (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">mali</b> <i>small, little</i>) have always the <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in masculine, regardless where they’re used, and they’re listed so. Its feminine form is <b class=\"hrv\">mal<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></b> and so on.</p>\n<p>The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">gotov</b> is used to express that something is prepared or ready, e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ručak je gotov.</b> <i>The dinner is ready.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The <em>adverbs of intensity</em> are also used with adjectives, and must be placed right before them (or fused, in case of <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b>):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Riba je <b class=\"hrvc\">jako</b> velika.</b>\n<i>The fish is very big.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Jezero je <b class=\"hrvc\">dosta</b> dub<u>o</u>koʷ¹.</b>\n<i>The lake is quite deep.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Rest<u>o</u>r<u>a</u>n nije <b class=\"hrvc\">pr<u>e</u></b>sk<u>u</u>p.</b>\n<i>The restaurant isn’t too expensive.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sunce je <b class=\"hrvc\">stvarno</b> jako.</b>\n<i>The sun is really strong.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vlak je <b class=\"hrvc\">strašno</b> spor.</b>\n<i>The train is terribly slow.</i> (colloq.)\n</p></div>\n<p>The adverb of intensity <b class=\"hrv\">jako</b> is exactly the same as the neuter form of the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">jak</b> <i>strong</i>, but its meaning is not equal. More about that in the next chapter.</p>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p><em>Don’t forget</em>: nouns and adjectives really <em>don’t have the same endings</em>.

There has to be some benefit from gender, from case marked by endings, and so on.</p>\n<p>However, I don’t think so. There was maybe a purpose once for many features, but now we are just left with relics. For instance, why would the word <b class=\"hrv\">noć</b> <i>night</i> be feminine? We know it’s inherited from very ancient times, since many related languages have a similar word, and it’s usually feminine: German <i>Nacht</i>, Latin <i>nox</i>, Greek νύξ <i>nýx</i>, Albanian <i>natë</i>, Lithuanian <i>naktis</i> etc. Therefore, the matching word was almost certainly also feminine in the common ancestor of all these languages. But we have no idea why it was feminine at all. Many things in languages are <em>just so</em>, and we don’t know why.</p>\n<p>In a case you will read a grammar published in Croatia, names of genders in Croatian are <b class=\"hrv\">muški rod</b> (masc.), <b class=\"hrv\">ženski rod</b> (fem.) and <b class=\"hrv\">srednji rod</b> (neut.); for some unknown reason, they are always listed in that order. Unfortunately, Croatian textbooks and grammars written for general population always mention only three genders...</p>\n<p>It’s interesting that some Croatian style/grammar manuals (i.e. books and websites suggesting what is “correct”) suggest that <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b>, when meaning <i>physical pain</i>, must be masculine. This advice is <em>ignored by virtually everyone</em>, including government websites, textbooks, newspapers, scientific papers, etc. This is just in case you find such an advice somewhere: just ignore it.</p>\n<p>A small remark: Croatian nouns ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>, regardless of gender, are also called <em>a-nouns</em>; feminine nouns <em>not</em> ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> are also called <em>i-nouns</em>.</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<!--##EXAMPLE##-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"example_10\", \"Examples\")'>\n<span id=\"example_10_ctrl\">↓ Examples (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"example_10\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>This list of side dishes from a small restaurant in Zagreb contains a number of adjectives:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/k55NjJR/EC-Side-Dishes.jpg\" title=\"Prilozi / Side dishes\"/>\n<p>As you can see, all items are translated to English. Interesting ones are:</p>\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">zelena sal<u>a</u>ta</b> literally means <i>green salad</i> – we don’t have a special noun for <i>lettuce</i>, this phrase is used instead. Since <b class=\"hrv\">sal<u>a</u>ta</b> is feminine (it ends in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>) the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">zelen</b> <i>green</i> must go to the feminine form.</p>\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">ljuta mljevena paprika</b> – again, <b class=\"hrv\">paprika</b> is feminine by the usual rule, so both adjectives before it get an <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>. It’s interesting that the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">ljut</b> means both <i>angry</i> and <i>hot</i> (spice). We don’t use words related to heat to describe how spicy something is!</p>\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">svježi kupus</b> is literally <i>fresh cabbage</i>; the adjective is usually used to distinguish it from the fermented cabbage, i.e. <i>sauerkraut</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">kiseli kupus</b>). The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">svjež</b> <i>fresh</i> here got at <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> before a masculine noun, which is, strictly speaking, not mandatory, but extremely common.</p>\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">kiseli krastavci</b> is literally <i>sour cucumbers</i>, the noun is here in plural, which will be described later (however, this noun simply gets an <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>, as the adjective before it).</p>\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">urnebes (ljuti/blagi)</b> is likely a specialty of the restaurant. The noun means roughy <i>mayhem, pandemonium</i>; the adjectives after it are still attached to the noun, so both – the second one means <i>mild</i> – get that <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>. Although adjectives normally precede nouns, you will see them after nouns once a while, especially in menus.</p>\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">ajvar</b> is a condiment made of baked red peppers, common in Balkan cuisine. Also, <b class=\"hrv\">kajmak</b> is not simply <i>cream</i>, but something specific for Turkish-influenced regions, all the way to Central Asia and Mongolia (check the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaymak\">Wikipedia entry</a>).</p>\n<p>Another example is this sign on the door of a post office:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7NqR7J5/EC-Zatvoreno.jpg\" title=\"Zatvoreno\" width=\"360px\"/>\n<p>As explained above, such stand-alone use of adjectives always requires neuter gender; the post office is <b class=\"hrv\">z<u>a</u>tv<u>o</u>ren</b> <i>closed</i> here.</p>\n</div> <!-- EXAMPLE -->\n<!--##QUIZ##-->\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Answ_10()\n{ var Answ=[\"velika\",\"pun\",\"slabo\",\"stvarno/zaista\",\"skup\",\"poznata\",\"duboko\",\"duga\",\"puna\",\"jako/vrlo\",\"lijepa\",\"gotov\",\"duga\",\"jeftino\"];

class=\"hrvc\">e</b>.</b> <i>The eye is brown.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p class=\"att\">There’s a <em>simple but effective rule</em> to determine which adjectives get an <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b>: ones that end in a Croatian-specific letter, that is, a letter that’s not pronounced like in English or even does not exist in English.</p>\n<p>Beside <b class=\"hrv\">smeđ</b>, often used adjectives that get

more such adjectives as you go.)</p>\n<p>If you want to say that something is e.g. <i>dark green</i>, put <b class=\"hrv\">tamno-</b> to the front of the color adjective – the result is one, long word. Likewise, <i>light</i> + color is expressed with <b class=\"hrv\">svjetlo-</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Majica je <b class=\"hrvc\">tamno</b>plava.</b>\n<i>The T-shirt is dark blue.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Colors <b class=\"hrv\">zelen</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">crven</b> have the following stress pattern: standard m <b class=\"hrv\">tamnoc<u>r</u>ven</b>, f <b class=\"hrv\">tamnocrv<u>e</u>na</b>, and ‘western’ stress always on <b class=\"hrv\">-r-</b>.)</p>\n<p>Two color adjectives have a specific meaning with some nouns, quite different from usage in English:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">plava</b> kosa</b>\n<i>blond hair</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">crno</b> vino</b>\n<i>red wine</i>\n</p>\n<p>Literally, in Croatian, wines can be <i>‘black’</i>, and blond-haired people have <i>‘blue’</i> hair. (If you want to know why, the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">plavi</b> meant <i>pale</i> thousand years ago.)</p>\n<p>There’s another adjective for ‘color’ frequently used in Croatian:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">šaren</b> <i>multicolored</i>, <i>motley</i>\n</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really translate into English: it’s used when in English you would describe something having colored stripes or many colors, especially bright, live colors:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Majica je <b class=\"hrvc\">šar<u>e</u>naʷ¹</b>.</b>\n<i>The T-shirt is multicolored.</i> (<i>has bright colors</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>(Since this adjective ends in <b class=\"hrv\">-en</b>, there’s a stress shift in the standard stress scheme.)</p>\n<p>There are two adjectives for colors that are used colloquially. Both have a special behavior – they don’t change their form at all, neither in plural, nor in gender, nor in cases. They have only one form. Such words are called <em>indeclinable</em> (<em>indecl.</em> for short). They are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"nopad\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">lila</b> <i>pale violet</i>  <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">roza</b> <i>pink</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#11-roza\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td><td class=\"brack nopad\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad vcent\">  colloquial &amp;<br/>  indeclinable\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(The colloqual adjective for <i>pink</i> exists also as a normal adjective <b class=\"hrv\">rozi</b>.)</p>\n<p>With colors and some similar adjectives, you can use the following adverbs that stress <em>completeness</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"nopad\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">potpuno</b>  <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sasvim</b>\n</p></td><td class=\"brack nopad\"> \n</td><td class=\"vcent nopad\"><p>\n  <i>completely</i>, <i>fully</i>\n</p></td></tr></table>\n<p>The adverb <b class=\"hrv\">potpuno</b> is much more common in speech. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Soba je <b class=\"hrvc\">potpuno</b> b<s>i</s>jela</b>. <i>The room is completely white.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can also <em>combine</em> colors: the first one is always in neuter N, and the second one changes; they are usually spelled with a hyphen between:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">crno-b<s>i</s>jeli telev<u>i</u>zor</b> <i>black-and-white TV set</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">crno-b<s>i</s>jela košulja</b> <i>black-and-white shirt</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">crveno-plava zastava</b> <i>red-and-blue flag</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Some adjectives have a slightly different form in the masculine nominative (which is the dictionary form) and whenever <em>anything</em> is attached to them (e.g. when they get an <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> for the feminine gender).</p>\n<p>For instance, the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">dobar</b> <i>good</i> has the feminine form <b class=\"hrv\">dobra</b>, that is <b class=\"hrv\">dobr</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">a</b>. Other forms that have <em>any</em> ending are also formed as <b class=\"hrv\">dobr</b> + <em>ending</em>.</p>\n<p>In the same way as for some nouns, can say that <b class=\"hrv\">dobr-</b> is the <em>case-base</em> of the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">dobar</b> and list it together with the dictionary form. For most adjectives their <em>case-base</em> is the same as their masculine form, so we list it only when it’s needed. A good Croatian dictionary should list it too (or something equivalent to it, e.g. the feminine form).</p>\n<p>Often used adjectives that have a specific <em>case-base</em> are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dobar</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dobr-</b>) <i>good</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gladan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">gladn-</b>) <i>hungry</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">hladan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">hladn-</b>) <i>cold</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mokar</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">mokr-</b>) <i>wet</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mračan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">mračn-</b>) <i>dark</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">opasan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">opasn-</b>) <i>dangerous</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prazan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">prazn-</b>) <i>empty</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ružan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ružn-</b>) <i>ugly</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sladak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sla<b class=\"hrvc\">t</b>k-</b>) <i>sweet</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sretan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sretn-</b>) <i>happy</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#11-sretan\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">strašan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">strašn-</b>) <i>terrible</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">taman</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">tamn-</b>) <i>dark</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tužan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">tužn-</b>) <i>sad</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">umoran</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">umorn-</b>) <i>tired</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">važan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">važn-</b>) <i>important</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">žedan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">žedn-</b>) <i>thirsty</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>You see that two adjectives have meaning <i>dark</i>. The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">mračan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">mračn-</b>) means not well-lit, or gloomy (e.g. <i>movie</i>), while <b class=\"hrv\">taman</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">tamn-</b>) means something painted in a dark paint, or having a dark color (e.g. <i>hair</i>).</p>\n<p>The <em>‘case-base’</em> usually looks like nominative masculine form without the last <b class=\"hrv\">a</b>, but sometimes there are other kinds of alternations:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bole<b class=\"hrvc\">stan</b></b> (<b class=\"hrv\">bole<b class=\"hrvc\">sn</b>-</b>) <i>sick</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">top<b class=\"hrvc\">ao</b></b> (<b class=\"hrv\">top<b class=\"hrvc\">l</b>-</b>) <i>warm</i></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Warning</em>. Some books give a rough rule that <b class=\"hrv\">-a-</b> is always lost, whenever anything is added. This is true for most adjectives with more than one syllable – but not for all. Also, it’s not the complete rule, as you can see from additional consonant changes that sometimes apply.</p>\n<p>Let’s put the adjectives above to use:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivana je <b class=\"hrvc\">žedna</b></b>. <i>Ivana is thirsty.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan je <b class=\"hrvc\">žedan</b></b>. <i>Ivan is thirsty.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>As I have already explained, adjectives usually get an <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> before masculine nouns, especially colloquially; but it doesn’t happen with all adjectives, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">dobar</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dobr-</b>) <i>good</i> is almost always used without <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">On je <b class=\"hrvc\">dobar</b> prijatelj</b>. <i>He’s a good friend.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Compare this with:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">On je <b class=\"hrvc\">stari</b> prijatelj</b>. <i>He’s an old friend.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Other adjectives with a specific <em>case-base</em> are often used without <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> before masculine nouns as well.</p>\n<p>The following adjectives are used a bit differently than in English:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">debeo</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">debe<b class=\"hrvc\">l</b>-</b>) <i>thick</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">lagan</b> <i>light(weight), ‘easy’</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kratak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">kratk-</b>) <i>short</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mastan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ma<b class=\"hrvc\">sn</b>-</b>) <i>fat</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nizak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ni<b class=\"hrvc\">s</b>k-</b>) <i>low</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">težak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">te<b class=\"hrvc\">š</b>k-</b>) <i>heavy, ‘hard’</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Croatian uses <b class=\"hrv\">težak</b> <i>heavy</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">lagan</b> <i>light</i> in the literal sense:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kamen je <b class=\"hrvc\">težak</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('11_kamen_je_tezak_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>The stone is heavy.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kutija je <b class=\"hrvc\">lagana</b>.</b> <i>The box is light.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Croatian also uses these two adjectives to indicate <em>difficulty</em>, in a quite different fashion than in English (the word <b class=\"hrv\">dosta</b> is here just to practice adverbs a bit):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Knjiga je dosta <b class=\"hrvc\">teška</b>.</b>\n<i>The book is quite ‘heavy’.</i> (= <i>hard</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pr<u>o</u>bl<u>e</u>m je <b class=\"hrvc\">lagan</b>.</b>\n<i>The problem is ‘light’.</i> (= <i>easy</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>(If you know some German, you will recall the adjective <em>schwer</em>, with exactly these two meanings.)</p>\n<p>Next, the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">nizak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">nisk-</b>) <i>low</i> is used to specify low height of things in Croatian:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Polica je <b class=\"hrvc\">niska</b>.</b> <i>The shelf is low.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Unlike English, it’s also used for short people (who are ‘low’ in Croatian):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana je <b class=\"hrvc\">niska</b>.</b> <i>Ana is ‘low’.</i> (= <i>short</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">kratak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">kratk-</b>) <i>short</i> is used in Croatian only to describe movies, bridges, roads, pieces of wood, etc.</p>\n<p>In a similar fashion, books and people can be <b class=\"hrv\">debeo</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">debel-</b>) <i>thick</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Knjiga je <b class=\"hrvc\">debela</b>.</b> <i>The book is thick.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivana je <b class=\"hrvc\">debela</b>.</b> <i>Ivana is ‘thick’.</i> (= <i>fat, plump</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>Furthermore, Croatian has <em>two</em> adjectives corresponding to English <i>free</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">besplatan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">besplatn-</b>) <i>free</i> (of charge)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">slobodan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">slobodn-</b>) <i>free</i> (of restrictions), <i>unoccupied</i>\n</p>\n<p>You would use the first adjective <em>only</em> when something is offered without payment, e.g. a free sample, free show etc., and the other adjective in all other circumstances. This is basically the same difference as German <i>kostenlos</i> vs. <i>frei</i>, or Spanish <i>gratuito</i> vs. <i>libre</i>.</p>\n<p>You will notice that neuter forms of adjectives are often used as <em>adverbs</em>, i.e. words that modify verbs and other adjectives. For example, the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">spor</b> <i>slow</i> in the neuter form <b class=\"hrv\">sporo</b> means <i>slow</i> (before a neuter noun, or when describing it) or <i>slowly</i> when used without a noun:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana vozi <b class=\"hrvc\">sporo</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('11_ana_vozi_sporo_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana drives slowly.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Many adjectives are used like that, and it usually corresponds to English <i>-ly</i>, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">užasno</b> is the neuter form of <b class=\"hrv\">užasan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">užasn-</b>) <i>terrible</i>, but also stands for English <i>terribly</i>.</p>\n<p>However, some adjectives when used as adverbs <em>change meaning</em>. They are best remembered as separate words. The most often used ones are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">adjective</th>\n<th class=\"last\">adverb</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">jak</b> <i>strong</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">jako</b> <i>very</i> / <i>very much</i>\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">mali</b> <i>small, tiny</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">malo</b> <i>a bit, a little</i>\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pun</b> <i>full</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">puno</b> <i>a lot</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#11-puno\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For instance, the first sentence contains an adjective, but the others contain adverbs of intensity:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vino je <b class=\"hrvc\">jako</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('11_vino_je_jako_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>The wine is strong.</i> (about <b class=\"hrv\">vino</b> <i>wine</i> = a noun)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Jako</b> je vruće.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('11_jako_je_vruce_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>It’s very hot.</i> (about <b class=\"hrv\">vruće</b> <i>hot</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"gender-m\">Auto</b> je <b class=\"hrvc\">jako</b> brz.</b>\n<i>The car is very fast.</i> (about <b class=\"hrv\">brz</b> <i>fast</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran <b class=\"hrvc\">jako</b> voli čokol<u>a</u>du.</b>\n<i>Goran likes chocolate very much.</i> (about the verb)\n</p></div>\n<p>When used with another adverb or adjective, <b class=\"hrv\">jako</b> corresponds to English <i>very</i> (e.g. <i>very hot</i>); with a verb, it corresponds to <i>very much</i>.</p>\n<p>There’s one more useful, but very colloquial word, mostly used by younger people. It can be used as an adjective <em>and</em> as an adverb of intensity with another adjective or a verb. (Its use with verbs is <em>very</em> colloquial!) When used as an adjective, it’s indeclinable:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"nopad vcent\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">super</b> (colloq.)  </td><td class=\"brack2 nopad\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad\"> </td><td class=\"last\">\nadj. indecl. <i>great, excellent, superb</i><br/>\nadv. <i>super, very</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For instance, you’ll hear and sometimes read:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\">super</b> majicu.</b>\n(colloq.) <i>I have a great T-shirt.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"gender-m\">Auto</b> je <b class=\"hrvc\">super</b> brz.</b>\n(colloq.) <i>The car is super fast.</i>\n<p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana <b class=\"hrvc\">super</b> pjeva.</b>\n(colloq.!) <i>Ana sings great.</i>\n</p></p></p></div>\n<p>Finally, there’s one very useful word used for comparisons:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">kao</b> <i>like</i>, <i>as</i>\n</p>\n<p>While English has two words used to compare against something else, Croatian has one multipurpose word. It’s used like this:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">More je hladno <b class=\"hrvc\">kao</b> led.</b>\n<i>The sea is cold as ice.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">kao</b> doesn’t affect the case of the following word, and never changes case etc. In speech, it’s often shortened to <b class=\"hrv\">ko</b>, spelled also as <b class=\"hrv\">k’o</b>.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"11-bijel\">® In Serbia, where “Ekavian” forms dominate, the adjective <i>white</i> has the form <b class=\"hrv\">beo</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">bel-</b>).</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"11-narancast\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">narančast</b>, a slightly different adjective is used in Serbia: <b class=\"hrv\">narandžast</b>. It’s also common in Bosnia. Besides <b class=\"hrv\">smeđ</b>, there’s another, but indeclinable adjective for <i>brown</i>, used in Bosnia and Serbia: <b class=\"hrv\">braon</b>. It completely prevails in Serbia, where <b class=\"hrv\">smeđ</b> is really only used to describe eyes, hair and color of pets.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"11-roza\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">roza</b>, a slightly different word <b class=\"hrv\">roze</b> is common in Serbia and Bosnia.

(You will also often hear a slightly corrupted form <b class=\"hrv\">dobar večer</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">dobro večer</b>, and other worn out variants; in Dalmatia, you’ll often hear <b class=\"hrv\">dobro veče</b>.)</p>\n<p>The informal greetings vary. The most common ones are:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bok</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_bok_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(Zagreb, Northwestern Croatia)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#12-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ćao</b> (coast, other areas)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ej</b> (Dalmatia, other areas)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">haj</b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Warning</em>. These words are not colloquial: they are informal, i.e. used among friends and in the family. You cannot enter a random shop and address people working there with <b class=\"hrv\">bok</b>. You can use informal words only with people you’re close with.</p>\n<p>The conversation would proceed depending on the level of familiarity. For example, you can greet your grandmother with a formal <b class=\"hrv\">dobar dan</b>, but proceed in the familiar mode.</p>\n<p>Croatian has <em>two</em> second person forms of the verb and <em>two</em> pronouns: one for (familiar) singular and another for plural. The forms are easily obtained from the <em>pres-3</em>; the forms for the verb <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² +) are listed as well:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th><em>pres-2</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\"><em>pres-2pl</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>regular verbs</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrvc\">-š</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrvc\">-te</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² +) <em>be</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">si</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">ste</b>²</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čeka<b class=\"hrvc\">š</b> vlak.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_cekas_vlak_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>You’re waiting for the train.</i> (one person)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čeka<b class=\"hrvc\">te</b> vlak.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_cekate_vlak_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>You’re waiting for the train.</i> (a group, or with respect)\n</p></div>\n<p>When you are talking formally to persons you don’t know very well, to your superiors, etc., you <em>should address them in plural</em>, as if you were talking to a group.</p>\n<p>You can then ask about how is someone doing. This is a real question, not just formal as English <em>how do you do</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"hrvc\">si</b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_kako_si_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(fam.)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"hrvc\">ste</b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_kako_ste_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(resp./group)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(Colloquially, you’ll often hear other questions with this meaning, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">šta ima</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">kako ide</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">di si</b> etc., depending on the region.) You can answer with e.g.:<p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dobro, hvala.</b> <i>Fine, thank you.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Since the word <b class=\"hrv\">hvala</b> is very common in speech, it’s often simplified to <b class=\"hrv\">fala</b>.</p>\n<p>It’s common to ask about family and close persons; the usual way is:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako je</b> … (N) <b class=\"hrv\">?</b> <i>How is … doing?</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>This is quite simple, since you don’t have to do anything with the name of person you are asking about – the nominative, default case is used. You can answer with a short sentence, giving just the most important information, or a whole story:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako je Damir?</b> <i>How is Damir doing?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Dobro je.</b> <i>He/she’s fine.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Bolestan je.</b> <i>He’s sick.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— N<u>e</u> znam.</b> <i>I don’t know.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>To <em>ask back</em> (after you have answered) you have to use personal pronouns (I will explain them fully in the next chapter):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako si <b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_kako_si_ti_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(fam.)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako ste <b class=\"hrvc\">Vi</b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_kako_ste_vi_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(resp./group)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Why do you have to use personal pronouns now? It’s mandatory when you switch the subject, and someone else becomes the subject. It’s also common to start such back questions with <b class=\"hrv\">A kako…</b> (actually, the word <b class=\"hrv\">a</b> emphasizes the change of topic).</p>\n<p>English has only one pronoun for both meanings – <i>you</i> – and verb forms are always the same. However, English once had such a difference, but it was lost. Southern US varieties have now colloquially <i>you</i> (singular) vs. <i>y’all</i> (plural). It’s important to remember that Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">vi</b> is used also to address single people you respect or you’re not familiar with, while <b class=\"hrv\">ti</b> is used only for individuals you’re close with.</p>\n<p>You can use the word <b class=\"hrv\">kako</b> to ask about someone’s name. The sentence uses the same grammar as French, Italian or Spanish, and it’s actually simpler – <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² is always used:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\">\n<tr><td>(French)</td><td><i>Comment <u>t</u>’appelles-tu?</i></td>\n<td class=\"brack nopad\" rowspan=\"4\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad\" rowspan=\"4\">  </td>\n<td class=\"vcent nopad\" rowspan=\"4\">lit.<br/>‘<i>How do you call yourself?</i>’</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>(Italian)</td><td><i>Come <u>ti</u> chiami?</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td>(Spanish)</td><td><i>¿Cómo <u>te</u> llamas?</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td> </td><td><b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"hrvc\">se</b> <b class=\"tt\">z<u>o</u>veš<b class=\"ttb\">zvati</b></b>?</b></td></tr>\n</table>\n<p>All sentences above are informal, of course: you would use them with e.g. children. For adults you’re not familiar with – and you wouldn’t ask for their name if you were familiar with them – you need plural: <b class=\"hrv\">kako <b class=\"hrvc\">se</b> <b class=\"tt\">z<u>o</u>vete<b class=\"ttb\">zvati</b></b></b>.</p>\n<p>You can comment how somebody looks. The most common way is to use the verb:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">izgl<u>e</u>dati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><u>i</u>zgl<u>e</u>da</b>) <i>appear, seem, look</i>\n</p>\n<p>This verb has – <em>only in the Standard scheme</em> – a different syllable stressed in the present compared to the infinitive: one syllable to the left. Actually, such shift in the present tense happens to many verbs, about 13% of verbs listed in the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"/p/d0.html\">Core Dictionary</a>.</p>\n<p>Since it would be too much to list all <em>pres-3</em> forms that differ from infinitives just by a stress mark, I’ve invented the following <em>shorthand notation</em>: instead of writing a completely regular <em>pres-3</em> form with just a shifted Standard stress, I’ll simply write the symbol «:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">\nShorthand for Standard stress shift\n</th><tr><td class=\"first\">\ninstead of\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">izgl<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>e</u></b>dati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>i</u></b>zgl<u>e</u>da</b>)\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\nI’ll write just\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">izgl<u>e</u>dati</b> («)</td>\n</tr></tr></table>\n<p>That symbol means: in the Standard scheme, <em>the stress moves one syllable left</em> in the present tense forms, compared to infinitive. In the ‘western’ scheme, <em>the stress does not move</em> (I personally pronounce it on the same syllable in both <em>inf</em> and <em>pres-3</em>).</p>\n<p>Therefore, I’ll list such verbs simply as:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">izgl<u>e</u>dati</b> («) <i>appear, seem, look</i>\n</p>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">izgl<u>e</u>dati</b> («) is used with adverbs or adjectives in neuter singular (they are quite similar in Croatian anyway). For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>I</u>zgl<u>e</u>daš odlično.</b> <em>You look great.</em> (fam.)\n</p></div>\n<p>More adverbs that are commonly used with this verb are <b class=\"hrv\">super</b> (colloq.) <i>great</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b> <i>nice</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">umorno</b> <i>tired</i>.</p>\n<p>If you are asking someone to give you something, you should use the verb <b class=\"hrv\">moliti</b> <i>kindly ask</i> (which covers English meaning <i>please</i>):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"hrvc\">te</b>…</b> (fam.)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"hrvc\">Vas</b>…</b> (resp./group)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>After that, a word in accusative should be used, e.g.:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čašu vode</b> <i>a glass of water</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jedan čaj</b> <i>a cup of tea</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jednu kavu</b> <i>a cup of coffee</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">jedan sendvič</b> <i>a sandwich</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kartu za vlak</b> <i>a train ticket</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kartu za Zadar</b> <i>a ticket to Zadar</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(I listed words and phrases in A, for convenience; some of them use grammar features that will be explained a bit later. Also,  forms <b class=\"hrv\">te</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Vas</b> above are accusatives of <b class=\"hrv\">ti</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Vi</b>; they will be explained in the next chapter.)</p>\n<p>When you are introduced to someone, you can say:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Drago mi je.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_drago_mi_je_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m glad (to meet you).</i>\n</p>\n<p>When you are in company, and the others are about to start eating, you can say:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dobar tek.</b> (like French <i>bon appétit</i>)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#12-tek\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>If you are giving a thing to someone (a gift, whatever) you should use one of the following words:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Izv<u>o</u>li.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_izvoli_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(fam.)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Izv<u>o</u>lite.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_izvolite_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(resp./group)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">izv<u>o</u>lite</b> also means <em>how can I help you</em>. For instance, if you come to a bank, a clerk will use the word to ask you what he or she can do for you. The same word will be used by a waiter in a bar, restaurant, etc.</p>\n<p>If you are given something, you should respond with:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hvala.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_hvala_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Thank you.</i>\n</p>\n<p>It’s often strengthened and made even more polite with <b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b> (sometimes <b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jepa</b>) or a bit more colloquially, <b class=\"hrv\">puno</b>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hvala <b class=\"hrvc\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_hvala_lijepo_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Thank you.</i> (politely)\n</p>\n<p>If you want to say that someone is <i>welcome</i>, use the following expressions (they depend on the gender of the person you’re talking to, unless you’re talking formally or to a group:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dobro doš<b class=\"hrvc\">ao</b>.</b> (to a male you’re familiar with)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dobro doš<b class=\"hrvc\">la</b>.</b> (to a female you’re familiar with)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dobro doš<b class=\"hrvc\">li</b>.</b> (to someone you aren’t familiar with, or to a group)<br/>\n</p>\n<p>(The words <b class=\"hrv\">došao</b>, etc. are adjective-like forms of the verb, which are otherwise used to form the past tense; it will be explained a bit later.)</p>\n<p>If you want to express <em>where</em> someone is welcome to, use <em>destinations</em>, i.e. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ / <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + A (English uses <i>to</i>, i.e. destinations as well):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dobro došli <b class=\"hrvc\">u Hrvatsku</b>!</b> <i>Welcome to Croatia!</i> (to a group / not fam.)\n</p>\n<p>You will often see the two words are spelled together, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">dobrodošao</b> and like.</p>\n<p>When leaving, you can use the following farewells:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">do viđ<u>e</u>nja</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_do_vidjenja_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>goodbye</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">laku noć</b> <i>good night</i>\n</p>\n<p>The farewell <b class=\"hrv\">do viđ<u>e</u>nja</b> – often spelled as <b class=\"hrv\">doviđ<u>e</u>nja</b> – is quite formal. The following expressions are a bit less formal:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">vidimo se</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_vidimo_se_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>see you</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čujemo se</b> (the same, but over the phone)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pozdrav</b> <i>bye</i>\n</p>\n<p>The following words are quite informal:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bok</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_bok_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n(Zagreb, Northwest Croatia)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ćao</b> (coast, other areas)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u>d<u>i</u>o</b> (Dalmatia, other areas)\n</p>\n<p>(These geographical differences are <em>not</em> absolute, you will hear <b class=\"hrv\">ćao</b> occasionally from people in Zagreb, <b class=\"hrv\">bok</b> in Dalmatia, etc.)</p>\n<p>If someone is not just leaving, but departing, that is, he or she will travel, you should always use:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sretan put</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('12_ec_sretan_put_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>nice journey</i> (French <i>bon voyage</i>)\n</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"12-diff\">® Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">dobra večer</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">dobro veče</b> is common in most parts of Bosnia and Serbia, and heard in Croatia as well; <b class=\"hrv\">zdravo</b> is a common greeting in these countries, and sometimes it’s heard in Croatia as well. The greeting <b class=\"hrv\">ćao</b> is very common in Serbia.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"12-tek\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">dobar tek</b>, in Serbia and Bosnia usually <b class=\"hrv\">prijatno</b> is used, also heard in some parts of Croatia.</p>\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3505944178840733289&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3505944178840733289&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3505944178840733289&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3505944178840733289&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3505944178840733289&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/greetings\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\ngreetings</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/polite%20expressions\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\npolite expressions</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/present%20tense\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\npresent tense</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/stress\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\nstress</span></a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</p></p></div>"

There are again only two endings to remember: one for nouns in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> and feminine nouns not in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>, and another for all other nouns. Let’s take the following nouns:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č</b> <i>cake</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kuća</b> <i>house</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kuhinja</b> <i>kitchen</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ladica</b> <i>drawer</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#15-ladica\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>rm<u>a</u>r</b> <i>closet, wardrobe</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#15-ormar\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">peć</b> f <i>oven, furnace</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">soba</b> <i>room</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">stan</b> <i>apartment</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>With them, and other nouns we have already learned, can make sentences like these:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana je <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> kuć<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is in the house.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan je <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> Zagreb<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan is in Zagreb.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Spavamo <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> hot<u>e</u>l<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_spavamo_u_hotelu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>We sleep in a hotel.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Riba pliva <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> mor<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>A fish is swimming in the sea.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan je <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> škol<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan is at school.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kuhamo <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> kuhinj<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>.</b>\n<i>We’re cooking in the kitchen.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">K<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č je <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> <b class=\"gender-f\">peć<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b>.</b>\n<i>The cake is in the oven.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, we can use objects as well:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kuham čaj <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> kuhinj<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>.</b>\n<i>I’m cooking tea in the kitchen.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Gledamo telev<u>i</u>ziju <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> sob<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>.</b>\n<i>We’re watching TV in the room.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You will find this verb useful:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">živjeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>i</u>vi</b>) <i>live</i>\n</p>\n<p>Verbs having infinitives ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-jeti</b> have almost always <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in their <em>pres-3</em>, so they are not really irregular. Let’s put it to use:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana ž<u>i</u>vi <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> Zagreb<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana lives in Zagreb.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ž<u>i</u>vim <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> Split<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>I live in Split.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>As you hopefully remember, some nouns when used as destinations require <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ instead of <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨. When they are used as locations, you still have to use <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ with them:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ž<u>i</u>vimo <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> Brač<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>We live on the island of Brač.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivana je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> plaž<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_ivana_je_na_plazi_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ivana is on the beach.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> trg<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is on the (main) town square.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>With locations, Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ roughly translates as <i>in</i>, and <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ as <i>on</i> or <i>at</i>. Here are a couple of ‘activities’ – you finally know how to say <i>on vacation</i> or <i>at university</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> fakult<u>e</u>t<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_ivan_je_na_fakultetu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ivan is at university.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> odmor<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is on vacation.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> večer<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>.</b>\n<i>Goran is at dinner/supper.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> put<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan is on a trip.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Don’t forget that certain Croatian nouns require <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ where English uses <i>in</i> (the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"/p/d0.html\">Core Dictionary</a> marks such nouns). For example (nouns are here listed in DL, of course):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na nebu</b> <i>in the sky</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na slici</b> <i>in the picture</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na sv<s>i</s>jetu</b> <i>in the world</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na ulici</b> <i>in the street</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>It also applies to appearing on <em>electronic media</em>, including movies and phone:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na filmu</b> <i>in the movie</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na radiju</b> <i>on the radio</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na telef<u>o</u>nu</b> <i>on the phone</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na telev<u>i</u>ziji</b> <i>on TV</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The preposition <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ also applies to <em>weather conditions</em> – being exposed to blowing wind, sun, etc:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na hladn<u>o</u>ći</b> <i>in the cold</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na kiši</b> <i>in the rain</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na sn<s>i</s>jegu</b> <i>in the snow</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na suncu</b> <i>in the sun</i>, <i>exposed to sun</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na vjetru</b> <i>exposed to the wind</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na zraku</b> <i>in the</i> (<i>fresh</i>) <i>air</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#15-zrak\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Some nouns can be used with both <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ and <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ – then the <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ gives an ordinary meaning, and <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ a derived, metaphorical one:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">u moru</b> <i>in the sea</i> (below surface / swimming)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na moru</b> <i>at the seaside</i>; <i>on the sea</i> (sailing)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">u selu</b> <i>in the village</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na selu</b> <i>in countryside</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>So, when you tell in Croatian that someone’s <b class=\"hrv\">na moru</b> he or she can be just on vacation; when somebody is <b class=\"hrv\">u moru</b>, it’s swimming or diving.</p>\n<p>However, the noun <b class=\"hrv\">sv<s>i</s>jet</b> <i>world</i> can use both <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ and <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨, with not much difference in meaning.</p>\n<p>What about <i>at work</i>? Again, we use <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ with activities like these:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">posao</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pos<b class=\"hrvc\">l</b>-</b>)\nm <i>work, job</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ručak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ručk-</b>)\n<i>lunch</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sastanak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sastank-</b>)\n<i>meeting</i>\n</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> poslu.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_ivan_je_na_poslu_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ivan is at work.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> sastanku.</b>\n<i>Ana is in a meeting.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Damir je <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> ručku.</b>\n<i>Damir is at lunch.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Croatian doesn’t distinguish <i>in a meeting</i> from <i>at the meeting</i>. In fact, Croatian doesn’t have anything similar to English <i>at</i> – it’s always ‘<i>in the park</i>’, ‘<i>on the beach</i>’ etc.</p>\n<p>To <i>ask where</i> something or someone is, just start a question with the following word (this word varies a lot in everyday speech, e.g. you can hear <b class=\"hrv\">di</b> colloquially in some parts of Croatia, including cities of Zagreb, Split and Rijeka):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">gdje</b> <i>where</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#15-gdje\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Nothing else is needed, there’s no change of word order; as usual in Croatian, it’s normal to answer with just a location, or you can give a longer answer if you want to emphasize the rest of the sentence:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Gdje</b> je Ivan?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_gdje_je_ivan_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Where is Ivan?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Na putu.</b>\n<i>On a trip.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Na putu je.</b>\n<i>He’s on a trip.</i>\n</p><p>\n \n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Gdje</b> je Damir?</b>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Na telef<u>o</u>nu.</b>\n<i>On the phone.</i> (i.e. <i>talking</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>Standard Croatian (and many people in speech) <em>always</em> distinguishes <b class=\"hrv\">gdje</b> <i>where</i> from <b class=\"hrv\">kamo</b> <i>where... to</i>, but many people in speech use <b class=\"hrv\">gdje</b> <i>where</i> for both.</p>\n<p>If you have examined the sentences above <em>very</em> carefully, you might have noticed that the stress of <b class=\"hrv\">fak<u>u</u>lt<u>e</u>t</b> changed in DL. The same happens to <b class=\"hrv\">b<u>a</u>lk<u>o</u>n</b> <i>balcony</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č</b> <i>cake</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">v<u>o</u>jn<u>i</u>k</b> <i>soldier</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">život</b> <i>life</i>, and to many other nouns:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">N</th>\n<th class=\"last\">+ DL ending</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_kolac_s')\"> S▶ </a>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_kolac_w')\"> W▶ </a>\n</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kol<u>a</u>ču</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_kolacu_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">fak<u>u</u>lt<u>e</u>t</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_fakultet_s')\"> S▶ </a>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_fakultet_w')\"> W▶ </a>\n</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">fakult<u>e</u>tu</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('15_fakultetu_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">tel<u>e</u>f<u>o</u>n</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">telef<u>o</u>nu</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ž<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>vot</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">živ<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u></b>tu</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>This happens whenever these nouns get <em>any</em> case ending, not only DL. Now, I could write them as <b class=\"hrv\">p<u>a</u>p<u>i</u>r</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pap<u>i</u>r</b>-), and so on, but as with verbs where the present form only differs from the expected one by a stress shift, it’s much simpler to add only an indication of the stress shift:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">b<u>a</u>lk<u>o</u>n</b> (») <i>balcony</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č</b> (») <i>cake</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">fak<u>u</u>lt<u>e</u>t</b> (») <i>university dept.</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>rm<u>a</u>r</b> (») <i>closet</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>a</u>p<u>i</u>r</b> (») <i>paper</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>bl<u>e</u>m</b> (») <i>problem</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>o</u>jn<u>i</u>k</b> (») <i>soldier</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">život</b> (») <i>life</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For almost all such words, only the Standard stress shifts (to the ‘western’ position):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\">Standard stress shift in nouns</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\"><b class=\"hrv\">p<u>a</u>p<u>i</u>r</b> (») <i>paper</i><br/>\n          ↓<br/>\nadding any ending shifts the standard stress:<br/><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na pap<u><b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></u>ru</b> <i>on the paper</i>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>There are very rare exceptions, the most common being <b class=\"hrv\">život</b> (») <i>life</i>, where the stress position shifts for basically all speakers; it’s easy to recognize them, because the ‘western’ position is not marked in them.</p>\n<p>There’s another change in DL that applies only to nouns that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-ka</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ga</b>. For most of them, their ending changes to <b class=\"hrv\">-ci</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-zi</b>, but only in DL. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ž<u>i</u>vimo u Am<u>e</u>ri<b class=\"hrvc\">ci</b>.</b>\n<i>We live in America.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan je na sli<b class=\"hrvc\">ci</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan is in the picture.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran ima ranu na no<b class=\"hrvc\">zi</b>.</b>\n<i>Goran has a wound on his leg.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Primjer je u knji<b class=\"hrvc\">zi</b>.</b>\n<i>An example is in the book.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It does not apply to all nouns, there’s no such change in  personal names and family terms like <b class=\"hrv\">baka</b> <i>grandmother</i>. (Note again how we used just the noun <b class=\"hrv\">noga</b>, and English always likes a possessive, e.g. <i>his</i>, before parts of body.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we are <em>still</em> not able to say that <i>we’re in Croatia</i>, but I will explain it in a short while, don’t worry.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"15-acc\">\n<p>® In informal speech in Montenegro, locations are often formed as destinations, i.e. with A. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Zoran ž<u>i</u>vi u <b class=\"hrvc\">Podgoricu</b>.</b> (A)\n<i>Zoran lives in Podgorica.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This is <em>not standard</em> in Montenegro, but you will find it in popular songs, movies and writing.</p>\n</div><!-- acc -->\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"15-ladica\">While <b class=\"hrv\">ladica</b> is used in Serbia as well, the word <b class=\"hrv\">fi<u>o</u>ka</b> is much more common there for the <i>drawer</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"15-ormar\">Besides <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>rm<u>a</u>r</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>rm<u>a</u>n</b> is also used in Bosnia, Serbia and parts of Croatia, mostly in speech.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"15-zrak\">In most of Bosnia and in Serbia, the word for <i>air</i> is <b class=\"hrv\">vazduh</b>, so it’s <b class=\"hrv\">na vazduhu</b> there.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"15-gdje\">In Montenegro, the form <b class=\"hrv\">đe</b> <i>where</i> prevails and is used as standard.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_15\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_15_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_15\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>Some people claim that dative and locative are really <em>two cases, despite having identical forms</em>, since they have different functions. However, the accusative case has more than one function as well, but nobody wants to split it into several cases. (We’ll later see that other cases have more than one function too.)</p>\n<p>Still, in all modern Croatian grammars published in Croatia (the same holds for Serbian grammars published in Serbia) the dative and locative cases are listed separately in tables of noun and adjective endings. I mean, <em>really</em> separately – D is in the third row, and L in the sixth row. (In Serbia, L is often in the last, seventh, row!) Incredibly, even some web pages intended for foreigners who try to learn Croatian list these cases separately, having maybe just a small remark somewhere “<em>these two cases have the same endings</em>”.</p>\n<p>It’s as if some people are trying to make the language more complex than it really is.</p>\n<p>For instance, this table I found on the Internet has the D and L cases separately, but it also has an error – it says that the D of nouns in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> (‘Class II’ in the table) has the ending <b class=\"hrv\">-u</b>, which is, of course, wrong (it has <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>):</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/RhYQjwT/EC-Bad-Case-Table.jpg\" title=\"Horrible Case Table\" width=\"650\"/>\n<p>Also, ‘functions’ listed in the table are quite misleading in many ways. (Just in a case somebody might find this table here and share it, I’ve added the overlay <em>don’t use this</em>.) Such things are some of reasons I’ve decided to write this small ‘course’.</p>\n<p>It’s also interesting that this distinction of D and L applies to <em>modern</em> grammars. In <em>Institutionum linguae illyricae libri duo</em> – a grammar published in 1604 by  Bartholomaeus Cassius, usually known in Croatia as <b class=\"hrv\">Bartol Kašić</b> – there’s only one case listed in singular.</p>\n<p>Swedish also distinguishes <i>where</i> (<em>var</em>) from <i>where... to</i> (<em>vart</em>).</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<!--##QUIZ##-->\n<script language=\"JavaScript\"

      "html": "\n<p>Such use of DL is quite common with the following verbs, where something is given (or shown, or offered) to someone:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">daje</b>) <i>give</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nuditi</b> <i>offer</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pokaz<u>i</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pok<u>a</u>zuje</b>) <i>show</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prod<u>a</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>d<u>a</u>je</b>) <i>sell</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vraćati</b> <i>return</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">slati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">šalje</b>) <i>send</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The following nouns are also useful:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čestitka</b> (DL <b class=\"hrv\">-ci</b>) <i>greeting card</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dar</b> <i>gift</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pismo</b> <i>letter</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poklon</b> <i>gift</i>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poruka</b> (DL <b class=\"hrv\">-ci</b>) <i>message</i>, <i>note</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">razglednica</b> <i>(picture) postcard</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<!--\n\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">čestitati</b> on its own means <em>congratulate</em>, but with an object in accusative (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">rođendan</b> <em>birthday</em>), it rather means <em>wish a happy...</em> (<em>birthday</em>). For instance:<p>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana čestita rođendan.</b>\n<em>Ana wishes a happy birthday.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>If you want to say <em>who</em> gets the wishes, you should add a recipient (likely a person) in DL:</p>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana čestita rođendan <b class=\"hrvc\">Ivanu</b>.</b>\n<em>Ana wishes a happy birthday to Ivan.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>If you use the verb without an object, but with a recipient, it translates to English <em>congratulate</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana čestita <b class=\"hrvc\">Ivanu</b>.</b>\n<em>Ana congratulates Ivan.</em><br />\n</p>\n\n<p>If you want to say <em>what</em> you&#8217;re congratulating on, you can add it as <b class=\"hrv\">na</b> + DL:</p>\n\n<p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ana čestita Ivanu <b class=\"hrvc\">na diplomi</b>.</b>\n<em>Ana congratulates Ivan on his diploma.</em>\n</p>\n\n-->\n<p>The verbs are used simply: what goes/is offered/shown to another person (gift, postcard, whatever) is put in the accusative case, and the recipient in DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">šalje<b class=\"ttb\">slati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">čestitku</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ivanu</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is sending a greeting card to Ivan.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">daje<b class=\"ttb\">davati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">poklon</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is giving a gift to Goran.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Croatian has two more verbs that have a very similar meaning to <b class=\"hrv\">davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">daje</b>), but with them what’s given is a <i>gift</i>, possibly for a special occasion:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"nopad\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dar<u>i</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">d<u>a</u>ruje</b>)  <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>kl<u>a</u>njati</b>\n</td><td class=\"brack nopad\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad vcent\">  <i>make a gift, donate</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>kl<u>a</u>njati</b> is a bit more common in speech, and the other verb in formal writing and newspapers. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> p<u>o</u>kl<u>a</u>nja <span class=\"hc-a\">knjigu</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is giving a book to Goran (as a gift).</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s a very rough but often effective rule: when an English verb takes two objects – and you order them without the word <i>to</i> – the first object corresponds to the Croatian DL case, and the second one to the A case:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>I’m writing</i>\n</td><td>\n<i>Ana</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>a letter.</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>He told</i>\n</td><td>\n<i>Ivan</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>the truth.</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>She will buy</i>\n</td><td>\n<i>Goran</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>a new bike.</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>I wish</i>\n</td><td>\n<i>you</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>a nice day.</i>\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\">\nIn Croatian:</td><td>\n DL\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n    A\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Of course, I haven’t explained past and future tenses yet, and I haven’t shown forms of pronouns in various cases – but it doesn’t matter, case use doesn’t depend on the tense, and whether you use nouns or pronouns. It’s always the same scheme.</p>\n<p>There are two more useful verbs that use DL, but it does not have anything to do with receiving something – it’s just the way the verbs are. They are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pom<u>a</u>gati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>že</b>) <i>help</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>i</u>p<u>a</u>dati</b> <i>belong</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>že<b class=\"ttb\">pom<u>a</u>gati</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('16_ana_pomaze_goranu_s')\"> S▶ </a>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('16_ana_pomaze_goranu_w')\"> W▶ </a>\n<i>Ana is helping Goran.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Auto</span> pr<u>i</u>p<u>a</u>da <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('16_auto_pripada_ani_s')\"> S▶ </a>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('16_auto_pripada_ani_w')\"> W▶ </a>\n<i>The car belongs to Ana.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(German uses here the same grammar as Croatian: German verbs <em>gehören</em> and <em>helfen</em> use the German Dative case. However, keep in mind that German cases are really <em>not</em> identical to Croatian cases!)</p>\n<p>The DL case is used in <em>thanking</em>, which is useful when you get something. The phrase is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">hvala na</b>¨ + DL <i>thanks for</i>\n</p>\n<p>Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ usually corresponds to English <i>for</i>, but not in this phrase. For example, you could say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hvala na...</b> <i>Thanks for the...</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">    ... <b class=\"hc-dl\">čestitci</b>.</b>\n<i>...greeting card.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">    ... <b class=\"hc-dl\">poruci</b>.</b>\n<i>...message.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">    ... <b class=\"hc-dl\">poklonu</b>.</b>\n<i>...gift.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">    ... <b class=\"hc-dl gender-f\">pomoći</b>.</b>\n<i>...help.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here we’ve used another feminine noun that doesn’t end in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>: <b class=\"hrv\">pomoć</b> f <i>help, assistance</i>.</p>\n<p>I already explained how in Croatian, words like <i>my</i> are less often used and possession is simply <em>implied</em>, especially with body parts and family members:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">p<u>e</u>re<b class=\"ttb\">prati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">kosu</span>.</b>\n<i>‘Ana is washing hair.’</i> (= <i>her hair</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>However, if she’s washing someone else’s hair, a common way – very common in speech – to express it, is to add the person – the one whose hair it is – in the DL case:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">p<u>e</u>re<b class=\"ttb\">prati</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">kosu</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('16_ana_pere_goranu_kosu_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana is washing hair</i> <i>‘to Goran’</i>. (i.e. <i>Goran’s hair</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>This is the preferred word order in such sentences – it’s, of course, possible to rearrange words if you want to stress something. This is <em>the same structure as</em> with the verb <i>send</i> or <i>write</i> – Goran will ‘get’ his hair washed, in the same way as he will get a message, letter or gift.</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Pay attention</em> that in the sentence above, <b class=\"hrv\">kosu</b> is in A – it is the object, after all – while <b class=\"hrv\">Goranu</b> is in DL. These two words are <em>not</em> attached to each other, don’t depend on each other: this is just the most common word order in such sentences.</p>\n<p>Croatian <em>has</em> possessive adjectives – I’ve already shown <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b> <i>my</i>, others will be shown a bit later – but with body parts, using the DL is the preferred way. If you are familiar with German, you’ll notice it uses the same system: the sentence above would translate exactly as <em>Ana wäscht <u>Goran</u> die Haare</em>. Dutch and Romance languages do it in the same way.</p>\n<p>In fact, English is famous for using a lot of possessive adjectives, while a great majority of European languages use them much less often. In most languages, possession of body parts and many other things is simply implied – it’s expressed only if something belongs to someone else, often by dative or something equivalent.</p>\n<p class=\"att\">If your brain is spinning now failing to comprehend how DL can mean possession of a body part, here’s another way to look at the sentence above: <i>Ana is washing the hair, and doing it <u>to Goran</u></i>.</p>\n<p>The accusative case of neuter nouns is equal to their default, nominative form. It’s not so for the DL case, and it becomes important that some neuter nouns have specific <em>case-base</em> as well, not shortened (like masculine ones) but <em>lengthened</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jete</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">djetet-</b>) <i>child</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pile</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pilet-</b>) <i>chicken</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Pay attention how <b class=\"hrv\"><s>i</s>je</b> in <b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jete</b> changes to <b class=\"hrv\">je</b> in its <em>case-base</em> (such alternations are a cause of misspellings for many native speakers).\n\n<p>The next two verbs use DL and have a obligatory <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² always with them (as explained already, it must be the second word, if possible):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">diviti se</b>² <i>marvel, admire</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">smijati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sm<u>i</u>je</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² <i>laugh</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#16-smijati\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">se</b> divi <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ivanu</b>.</b>\n<i>Goran marvels at Ivan.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">se</b> <b class=\"tt\">sm<u>i</u>je<b class=\"ttb\">smijati se</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is laughing at Goran.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>So in Croatian – if the DL case <em>kind of</em> corresponds to English <i>to</i> — you literally <i>‘marvel to someone’</i> and <i>‘laugh to someone’</i>... (which sounds wrong in English, of course).</p>\n<p>There’s another, completely different use of the DL case. It is possible with verbs of motion:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ići</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ide</b>) <i>go</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">t<u>r</u>čati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">t<u>r</u>či</b>) <i>run</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>If you are going or running <em>to someone</em>, it’s expressed in Croatian <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#16-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a> with DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ivanu</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is going to Ivan.</i> (where he is)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#16-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">T<u>r</u>čim<b class=\"ttb\">t<u>r</u>čati</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">mami</b>.</b>\n<i>I’m running to my mum.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(You see again that it’s implied <em>whose mum</em> it is.)</p>\n<p>It’s often used when you go to some shop or office held by someone, e.g.:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">fr<u>i</u>z<u>e</u>r</b> (») <i>hairdresser</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>u</u>b<u>a</u>r</b> (») <i>dentist</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> sutra <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">zub<u>a</u>ru</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan is going to the dentist tomorrow.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#16-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>These nouns are two more examples of the standard stress moving (<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>u</u>b<u>a</u>r</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">zub<u>a</u>ru</b>) indicated by my markings.</p>\n<p>As a very special use, the DL of the noun <b class=\"hrv\">kuća</b> <i>house</i> can be used as destination: it means <i>home</i>, even if you live in an apartment:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> danas <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">kući</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is going home today.</i>\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p><em>Warning</em>. This applies only to DL of this noun, when used without any prepositions. With the preposition <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨, this noun has the expected meanings:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> <b class=\"hc-a\">kuću</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is going to the house.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ + A)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> <b class=\"hc-a\">kući</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana is in the house.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ + DL)\n</p></div>\n</div><!-- att -->\n<p>The same meaning special meaning, especially in western and northern regions of Croatia, can be expressed with the following adverb:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">doma</b> <i>home</i> (as destination)\n</p>\n<p>There’s yet another use of the DL case, with certain nouns and adjectives. For example, this adjective is often accompanied by a noun in DL (this again corresponds to English <i>to</i>):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sličan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sličn-</b>) <i>similar</i>\n</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Višnja</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">slična</b> <span class=\"hc-dl\">trešnji</span>.</b>\n<i>Sour cherry is similar to cherry.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>In the previous sentence, <b class=\"hrv\">trešnja</b> <i>cherry</i> was put in DL.</p>\n<p>This is also used to express <i>look like</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ona</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">slična</b> <span class=\"hc-dl\">Ani</span>.</b>\n<i>She looks like Ana.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"16-smijati\">® In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, which completely dominates in Serbia, the verb <b class=\"hrv\">smijati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sm<u>i</u>je</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² has the unexpected form <b class=\"hrv\">smejati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sm<u>e</u>je</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>².</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"16-diff\">The use of DL of persons to express destinations seems to be much less common in Serbia, especially in speech. Another expression, which will be explained in the next chapters, is used instead.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_16\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_16_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_16\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>There is a common idea that Croatian and similar languages can reorder words almost freely (like in the examples above, <b class=\"hrv\">Ana piše pismo Ivanu</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">Ana piše Ivanu pismo</b>) because they have case markings, so it’s obvious what you write and who will get it.</p>\n<p>However, Icelandic, despite having case endings that distinguish accusative and dative, cannot reorder D and A!

Let’s list them and compare with not only English, but also Spanish demonstratives (as they are more similar to Croatian); I’ll list with them another adjective with a related meaning:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">Croatian</th>\n<th>English</th>\n<th class=\"last\">Spanish</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ovaj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ov-</b>)</td>\n<td><i>this</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>este</em>/<em>esta</em></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">taj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">t-</b>)</td>\n<td><i>that</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>ese</em>/<em>esa</em></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">onaj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">on-</b>)</td>\n<td><i>that over there</i> (<i>yonder</i>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>aquel</em>/<em>aquella</em></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">drugi</b></td>\n<td><i>other</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>otro</em>/<em>otra</em></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>They can be used as normal adjectives:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Ona</b> kuća</span> je <span class=\"hc-n\">velika</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_ona_kuca_je_velika')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>That house is big.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Marko</span> ž<u>i</u>vi u <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">ovom</b><span class=\"hc-dl\"> stanu</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_marko_zivi_u_ovom_stanu')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Marko lives in this apartment.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Unlike most other adjectives, the three adjectives listed above – <b class=\"hrv\">ovaj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ov-</b>), <b class=\"hrv\">taj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">t-</b>) and <b class=\"hrv\">onaj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">on-</b>) – cannot get <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in masculine nominative singular. (Recall that the same restriction applies to <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b> <i>my</i>).</p>\n<p>As in English, it’s quite common in Croatian to use certain adjectives on their own, without any noun, <em>as pronouns</em> (compare to English <i>each</i>, <i>others</i>, and so on). However, <em>regardless how they are used</em>, words that are originally adjectives still <em>change as adjectives</em>, that is, get case endings for adjectives.</p>\n<p>Demonstrative adjectives, in the neuter gender (i.e. <b class=\"hrv\">ovo</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">to</b>, etc.) are often used as <em>generic pronouns</em>, in questions, explaining things, etc.; the adjective-used-as-pronoun <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> is frequently translated with English <i>it</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">To</b> je <span class=\"hc-n subj\">mačka</span>.</b>\n<i>It’s a cat.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Ovo</b> je <span class=\"hc-n subj\">pas</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_ovo_je_pas')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>This is a dog.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>I’ll call such sentences <em>demonstrative</em>. They behave a bit strange: nouns in them (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">mačka</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">pas</b>) are subjects, so the verb <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² +) <i>be</i> agrees <em>with them</em>. It applies to using <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> with another pronoun as well:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">To</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">sam</b> <span class=\"hc-n subj\">ja</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_to_sam_ja')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>It’s me.</i> (lit. <i>‘It I am.’</i>)\n</p></div>\n<!-- DIFFERENT IN PDF -->\n<p>Since there are two words in N, to show you which one is the actual subject, it will get additionally marked with a <span class=\"subj-c\">blue frame</span> when you place your mouse over an example (or touch it, if you use a touchscreen). Try the examples above!</p>\n<p class=\"att\">Note you have to use <em>nominative forms</em> in Croatian (<b class=\"hrv\">ja</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">mi</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">ona</b>...) in such sentences, while in English it’s common to use object forms (<i>me, us, her...</i>).</p>\n<p>If you use <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> + adjectives, it’s a different type of sentence: you are talking about something else, already known. Now the word <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> is the subject, be careful that you use the neuter gender of adjectives:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Ovo</b> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">teško</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_ovo_je_tesko')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>This is heavy/hard.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This is completely different from how e.g. pronouns <b class=\"hrv\">ja</b> <i>I</i> or <b class=\"hrv\">ti</b> <i>you</i> (singular) behave: with them, you have to think what the pronoun represents, and adjust the gender accordingly. With <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> you have to use the neuter gender, regardless of what the pronoun represents!</p>\n<p>This is very often used to express that something belongs to someone, using possessive adjectives:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">To</span> je <span class=\"hc-n\">moje</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_to_je_moje')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>It’s mine.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Recall that <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b> gets <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b> in neuter, since it ends in a Croatian-specific consonant.)</p>\n<p>This explains why neuter gender is used when <em>adjectives are used on their own</em> on signs (e.g. <i>reserved</i>, <i>closed</i>): these are simply shortened sentences. However, <b class=\"hrv\">ovo</b> is still implied, so the adjective keeps the neuter gender:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">(<span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> je) <span class=\"hc-n\">rez<u>e</u>rv<u>i</u>rano</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_ovo_je_rezervirano_s')\" title=\"play clip (standard stress)\"> S▶ </a>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_ovo_je_rezervirano_w')\" title=\"play clip (western stress)\"> W▶ </a>   \n(<i>This is</i>) <i>reserved.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>So, if you wanted to write a note <i>mine!</i> on something, or just warn somebody when they want to take it, you would use:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Moje</span>!</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_moje')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Mine!</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Croatian has the 3rd person neuter pronoun <b class=\"hrv\">ono</b> <i>it</i>, but the demonstrative adjective/pronoun in the neuter gender – <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> – is almost always used instead, so a frequent phrase goes <em>always</em> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">To</span> je <span class=\"hc-n\">to</span>!</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_to_je_to')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>That’s it!</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can use <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> (or <b class=\"hrv\">ovo</b>, etc.), with the verb  <b class=\"hrv\">zvati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>o</u>ve</b>) <i>call</i> + <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² to express what is the name or word for something:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> se <b class=\"tt\">z<u>o</u>ve<b class=\"ttb\">zvati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-n\">džep</span>.</b>\n<i>This is called a pocket.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>To <em>ask what</em> is something called, use <b class=\"hrv\">kako</b> <i>how</i> (again, as in Spanish or Italian):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Kako</b> se <span class=\"hc-n\">to</span> <b class=\"tt\">z<u>o</u>ve<b class=\"ttb\">zvati</b></b> (na <span class=\"hc-dl\">hrvatskom</span>)?</b>\n<i>What is that called (in Croatian)?</i>\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p><em>Don’t forget</em> – <b class=\"hrv\">ovo</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> usually come first, but they aren’t always the subjects:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">To</span> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n subj\">mačka</b>.</b>\n<i>It’s a cat.</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">← <b class=\"hrv\">mačka</b> is the subject\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">To</span> smo <b class=\"hrvc hc-n subj\">mi</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_to_smo_mi')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>That’s us.</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">← <b class=\"hrv\">mi</b> <i>we</i> is the subject, so you must use the right verb form\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n subj\">To</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">lako</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_to_je_lako')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>That’s easy.</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n← <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> is the subject, so the adjective (<b class=\"hrv\">lako</b>) must be in neuter\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>This is <em>unlike</em> English, where all these sentences have the same verb form (<i>is</i>).

For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">P<u>o</u>znaješ<b class=\"ttb\">pozn<u>a</u>vati</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">jednog</b><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\"> mog</b><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\"> dobrog</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> prijatelja</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_poznajes_jednog_mog')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>You know a good friend of mine.</i> (lit. <i>‘one my good friend’</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>The normal order of adjectives in such phrases is demonstrative-possessive-descriptive, but it can be changed in principle.</p>\n<p>There’s another, very subtle way to express <em>indefiniteness of the subject</em> in sentences without objects – put the subject after the verb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">D<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>zi <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">vlak</b>.</b>\n<i><u>A</u> train is coming.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#18-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>(This explains the common order of words in sentences like <b class=\"hrv\">pada kiša</b> lit. <i>‘a rain is falling.’</i>)</p>\n<p>The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">drugi</b> is often translated as English <i>another</i>. While English e.g. <i>another apple</i> is a bit ambiguous, Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">drugi</b> means <i>not this one</i>, and Croatian uses <b class=\"hrv\">još</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">jedan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">jedn-</b>) in meaning <i>one more</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ž<u>e</u>lim <span class=\"hc-a\"><b class=\"hrvc\">drugu</b></span><span class=\"hc-a\"> olovku</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_zelim_drugu_olovku')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I want another pencil.</i> (<i>a different pencil</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ž<u>e</u>lim <b class=\"hrvc\">još <span class=\"hc-a\">jednu</span></b><span class=\"hc-a\"> olovku</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('18_zelim_jos_jednu_olovku')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I want another pencil.</i> (<i>one more</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>We have used here the following noun and verb:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">olovka</b> <i>pencil</i></td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>ljeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>li</b>) <i>want</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>While <b class=\"hrv\">jedan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">jedn-</b>) usually translates as <i>one</i>, Croatian has <em>no “noun”</em> like English <i>one</i>. When you would use <i>this one</i>, <i>another one</i> in English, only the adjective-as-pronoun corresponding to <i>this</i> or <i>another</i> is used in Croatian – but don’t forget to adjust its case and gender!

      "html": "\n<p>We know how to say <i>the red apple</i>, even <i>my apple</i>, but not <i>your apple</i> or <i>Ana’s apple</i>. So, let’s learn it.</p>\n<p>As I have already explained, words like <i>my</i> (or <i>Ana’s</i>) are simply <i>adjectives</i> in Croatian (more accurately, <em>possessive adjectives</em>). They are <em>not adjectives</em> in English, where you cannot say <i>the my apple</i>, but you can say <i>the red apple</i>. That’s one example where Croatian is simpler than English.</p>\n<p>As the rule, possessive adjectives never get the optional <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in masc. N.</p>\n<p>Each possessive adjective corresponds to one pronoun. There are three sets of pronouns with similar forms; the first set is:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">pronoun</th>\n<th class=\"last\">possessive</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ja</b> <i>I</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">moj</b> <i>my</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ti</b> <i>you</i> (sg.)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">tvoj</b> <i>your</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">—</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>All three end in <b class=\"hrv\">-j</b>, so they get <b class=\"hrv\">-em</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">-eg</b> instead of <b class=\"hrv\">-om</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">-og</b>, but, like <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b>, the other two adjectives above have additional, shortened forms in neuter and masculine genders as well:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">alt. endings for <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">tvoj</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masc. / neut. DL:</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-ojem</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">-om</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masc. p/a A:</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-ojeg</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">-og</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>You can use them as any adjective:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čekamo <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">tvog</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> brata</span>.</b> <i>We’re waiting for your brother.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čekamo <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">tvojeg</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> brata</span>.</b> (the same meaning, bit less common)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Pišem<b class=\"ttb\">pisati</b></b>\n<span class=\"hc-a\">poruku</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">tvojoj</b><span class=\"hc-dl\"> sestri</span>.</b> <i>I’m writing a message to your sister.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The following two adjectives don’t have any special forms, they change as normal adjectives (of course, since they end in an <b class=\"hrv\">-š</b>, they get <b class=\"hrv\">-em</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">-eg</b> in neuter and masculine):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">pronoun</th>\n<th class=\"last\">possessive</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">mi</b> <i>we</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">naš</b> <i>our</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">vi</b> <i>you</i> (pl./resp.)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vaš</b> <i>your</i> (i.e. <i>y’all’s</i>)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The last set contains the 3rd person pronouns. Here Croatian does not distinguish neuter from masculine possessive:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">pronoun</th>\n<th class=\"last\">possessive</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ona</b> <i>she</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">njen</b> <i>her</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">njezin</b> <i>her</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#19-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ono</b> <i>it</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">njegov</b> <i>its</i>/<i>his</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">on</b> <i>he</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">one</b> <i>they</i> (f)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ona</b> <i>they</i> (n)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">oni</b> <i>they</i> (m)<br/>\n</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">njihov</b> <i>their</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Knjiga</span> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">njihova</b>.</b> <i>The book is ‘their’.</i> (= <i>theirs</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Č<u>i</u>tam <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">njegovu</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> poruku</span>.</b> <i>I’m reading his message.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are <em>two</em> possessive adjectives that correspond to <b class=\"hrv\">ona</b> <i>she</i>. Both are used, you can use any you like.<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#19-diff\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>If you were careful, there was a mysterious possessive <b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b>. It should be used when something <em>belongs to the subject of the sentence</em>. For instance, if <i>Ana is writing a letter to her brother</i>, you would use it:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">piše<b class=\"ttb\">pisati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">pismo</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">svom</b><span class=\"hc-dl\"> bratu</span>.</b> <i>Ana is writing a letter to her </i>(=<i> Ana’s</i>)<i> brother.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>In real life, it’s not always used in 1st and 2nd person, so you will hear and sometimes read e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Pišem<b class=\"ttb\">pisati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">pismo</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">mom</span><span class=\"hc-dl\"> bratu</span>.</b> (colloq.) <i>I’m writing a letter to my brother.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The main purpose of <b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b> is distinguishing between two or more possible possessors in a sentence – it always points to the subject:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> vraća <span class=\"hc-dl\">Ivani</span>\n<b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">svoj</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> ključ</span>.</b> <i>Ana is returning her </i> (= <i>Ana’s</i>)<i> key to Ivana.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> vraća <span class=\"hc-dl\">Ivani</span>\n<b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">njen</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> ključ</span>.</b> <i>Ana is returning her</i> (= <i>Ivana’s</i>)<i> key to Ivana.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The reflexive possessive <b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b> doesn’t distinguish owner’s gender and number, i.e. it’s the same in masc. and fem., singular and plural – and that elegantly solves a classic problem in English, obvious in these three sentences:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<i>Everyone loves <u>his</u> mother.</i> or\n</p><p>\n<i>Everyone loves <u>his or her</u> mother.</i> or\n</p><p>\n<i>Everyone loves <u>their</u> mother.</i> ?\n</p></div>\n<p>The first option is problematic since <i>everyone</i> includes women too; the second option is too long, and the third option is condemned by some. Croatian simply uses:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Svatko</span> voli <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">svoju</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> majku</span>.</b> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#19-svatko\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>(The indefinite pronoun <b class=\"hrv\">svatko</b> will be explained in 48 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"48.html\">Everybody, Each and Everything Else</a>)</p>\n<p>How to make possessives out of names? In English, you just add <i>’s</i>, but it’s slightly more complicated in Croatian. It’s simplest for names ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>: just replace it with the <b class=\"hrv\">-in</b>, and (usually) you’re done. It works also for nouns in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> standing for people (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">tata</b> <i>Dad</i>):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">An<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">An<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Luk<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Luk<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mam<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></b> <i>Mom</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">mam<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sestr<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></b> <i>sister</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">sestr<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tat<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></b> m <i>Dad</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">tat<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For nouns and names that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-ca</b>, the <b class=\"hrv\">c</b> changes to <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> when <b class=\"hrv\">-in</b> is added:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ani<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>a</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ani<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>in</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prijat<u>e</u>lji<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>a</b> <i>friend</i> (f) →\n<b class=\"hrv\">prijat<u>e</u>lji<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>in</b>\n</p>\n<p>The noun <b class=\"hrv\">majka</b> <i>mother</i> also has a change in consonants, but not other nouns ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-ka</b>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">majka</b> <i>mother</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">maj<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>in</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">baka</b> <i>grandmother</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">bakin</b>\n</p>\n<p>What about male names that change as if ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>, like <b class=\"hrv\">Ante</b>? They also make possessives with <b class=\"hrv\">-in</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čekamo <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Antinu</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> sestru</span>.</b> <i>We’re waiting for Ante’s sister.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This also usually applies to female names that don’t end in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> and therefore don’t change at all (however, some people use alternative methods, to be described a bit later). For example:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Doris</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Doris<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ines</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ines<b class=\"hrvc\">in</b></b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For male names ending in a consonant or names like <b class=\"hrv\">Marko</b>, you should add an <b class=\"hrv\">-ov</b> (or <b class=\"hrv\">-ev</b> after Croatian-specific letters). It works for nouns standing for people as well:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Goran<b class=\"hrvc\">ov</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan<b class=\"hrvc\">ov</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Mark<b class=\"hrvc\">o</b></b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Mark<b class=\"hrvc\">ov</b></b><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hrvo<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b></b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hrvo<b class=\"hrvc\">jev</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sin</b> <i>son</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">sin<b class=\"hrvc\">ov</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prijatelj</b> <i>friend</i> (m) →\n<b class=\"hrv\">prijatelj<b class=\"hrvc\">ev</b></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>If a noun ends in <b class=\"hrv\">-c</b> (or its case-base), it turns to <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> when <b class=\"hrv\">-ev</b> is added:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">otac</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">o<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>-</b>) <i>father</i> (formal) → <b class=\"hrv\">o<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ev</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prin<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b></b> <i>prince</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">prin<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ev</b>\n</p>\n<p>All these words are <em>adjectives</em>, they change in case and gender! For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čekamo <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Aninu</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> sestru</span>.</b> <i>We’re waiting for Ana’s sister.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sj<u>e</u>dim u <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Hrvojevoj</b><span class=\"hc-dl\"> kuhinji</span>.</b> <i>I’m sitting in Hrvoje’s kitchen.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Goranova</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> mama</span>.</b> <i>Ana is Goran’s mom.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Since they are adjectives, they are more flexible than English possessives:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt hc-n\">Auto<b class=\"ttt\">masc.</b></b> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Anin</b>.</b> <i>The car ‘is Ana’s’.</i> (= <i>belongs to Ana</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>I’ve already explained that possession of body parts is usually expressed with the DL case. Is there any difference in meaning when possessive adjectives are used? Usually, there’s no difference, and DL is preferred with such nouns. However, here’s a difference in some circumstances: DL implies a kind of <em>close possession</em>, while possessive adjectives don’t. Compare these sentences:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n(1) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">p<u>e</u>re<b class=\"ttb\">prati</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">kosu</span>.</b>\n<i>Ana is washing Goran’s hair.</i> (lit. <i>‘washing the hair to Goran’</i>)\n</p><p>\n(2) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">p<u>e</u>re<b class=\"ttb\">prati</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Goranovu</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> kosu</span>.</b>\n(lit. <i>‘washing Goran’s hair’</i> – the same meaning?)\n</p></div>\n<p>They <em>don’t mean exactly the same</em>. The sentence #1 implies that the <i>hair is growing from Goran’s head</i>, while the sentence #2 could also apply to <i>cut hair</i> being washed for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>This is a very fine distinction not important in most circumstances. (The ‘close possession’ is sometimes called ‘<em>inalienable</em>’, but the name is not precise – the hair can be cut.)</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Pay attention</em>: in the DL possession, used for body parts, the noun for person is simply in DL (<b class=\"hrv\">Goran</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">Goran<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b></b>). When you use a possessive adjective – which you have to do to express possession of a <i>ball</i>, <i>dog</i>, <i>house</i> etc. – you have first to turn the person into a possessive (<b class=\"hrv\">Goran</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">Goran<b class=\"hrvc\">ov</b></b>) and then add the right ending for case and gender to it (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Goranov</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">Goranov<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b></b> for feminine A).</p>\n<p>With relatives, it’s normal to use poss. adjectives, as above (check the sentence about <i>Ana’s sister</i>). I’ll explain later when it’s more common to use DL for relatives as well.</p>\n<p>Possessives in Croatian are often used in street names, for example <i>Branimir street</i> – one of major streets in Zagreb – is actually <b class=\"hrv\">Branimirova ulica</b> <i>Branimir’s street</i>. The word <b class=\"hrv\">ulica</b> <i>street</i> is often dropped when it’s obvious what we’re talking about. (With specific streets, you should use the preposition <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> ž<u>i</u>vi u <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Branimirovoj</b><span class=\"hc-dl\"> ulici</span>.</b> <i>Ivan lives on ‘Branimirova’ street.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> ž<u>i</u>vi u <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Branimirovoj</b>.</b> (the same meaning, but shorter)\n</p></div>\n<p>The forms above apply to foreign names as well.

In English, you can just turn the last word into a possessive, but not so in Croatian.

      "html": "\n<!-- spans fixed -->\n<p>Croatian has a special way of expressing feelings and subjective opinions that’s quite unlike how it’s done in English.

This statement is <em>impersonal</em>.</p>\n<p>But what if <i>someone</i> (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Ana</b>) feels it’s cold? Croatian then adds <em>one who feels</em> something into such sentences, but in the dative/locative case (DL):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b> je hladno.</b> <i>‘It’s cold to Ana.’</i> = <i>Ana is cold.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The one who feels it, the ‘<em>experiencer</em>’ (here: <b class=\"hrv\">Ana</b>, DL <b class=\"hrv\">Ani</b>) is usually put to the beginning of the sentence, as above.</p>\n<p>In such sentences, pronouns in DL are very often used, when you want to express what <em>you</em> personally feel:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hladno <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_hladno_mi_je_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>‘It’s cold to me.’</i> = <i>I’m cold.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you pay attention, you might have noticed that we again have <em>two</em> words trying to get to the second position: <b class=\"hrv\">mi</b>² and <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² (the <em>pres-3</em> form of the verb <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b>). If something like that happens, <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² always comes after any pronouns.</p>\n<p>Such words with fixed second-place position always come in a ‘block’ and cannot be rearranged:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Često <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">je</b> hladno.</b> <i>‘It’s often cold to me.’</i> = <i>I’m often cold.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Gramatically, the sentence is still impersonal: there’s no subject anywhere. The ‘experiencer’ is in the 1st person, but the verb is the 3rd person, singular. The verb <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² doesn’t change, regardless of who feels cold:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Hladno <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1pl\">nam</b> je.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_hladno_nam_je_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>‘It’s cold to us.’</i> = <i>We’re cold.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This use of impersonal <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² with DL is frequently seen with the following adverbs:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bučno</b> <i>noisy</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dosadno</b> <i>boring</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">hladno</b> <i>cold</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b> <i>nice</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">loše</b> <i>bad</i> (see below)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">toplo</b> <i>warm</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vruće</b> <i>hot</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zabavno</b> <i>entertaining</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>These words don’t adapt to the gender of subject. Actually, there’s no subject in such sentences – they have quite different form in English and Croatian:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dosadno <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_dosadno_mi_je_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>‘It’s boring to me.’</i> = <i>I’m bored.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you would translate literally from English, you could say something completely different:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dosadan sam.</b> <i>I’m boring.</i> (<em>not</em> how you feel!)\n</p></div>\n<p>With the adverb <b class=\"hrv\">loše</b>, there’s a slightly shifted meaning when used with DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b> je loše.</b> <i>Ana is sick.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s interesting that German uses exactly the same construction: in sentences like these, the pronoun <em>mir</em> is in the German Dative case, and the verb is in the 3rd person:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\">\n<i>Mir ist kalt.</i><br/>\n<i>Mir ist langweilig.</i>  <br/>\n<i>Mir ist schlecht.</i>\n</td><td class=\"brack nopad\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad vcent\">  (German)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>All three sentences translate word-for-word from Croatian, the only difference is word order, which follows quite different rules in German.</p>\n<p>You can freely use <em><a class=\"showlink\" href=\"8.html#adv_of_inten\">adverbs of intensity</a></em>, including the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pr<u>e</u></b>vr<u>u</u>će <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"2\">nam</b> je.</b> <i>It’s too hot ‘to us’.</i> (= <i>for us</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Jako</b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je dosadno.</b> <i>I’m very bored.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There's also a verb that means <i>feel</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>sj<u>e</u>ćati</b> <i>feel</i>\n</p>\n<p>When used just with an object in A, it means <i>feel something</i>, an object, or something more abstract, e.g. pain. But when used with a <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² and an adverb, it describes <em>how someone feels</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> se <u>o</u>sj<u>e</u>ća odlično.</b> <i>Ana feels great.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>O</u>sj<u>e</u>ćam se grozno.</b> <i>I feel terrible.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This verb with <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² is used only for internal states. You cannot say “<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>sj<u>e</u>ćam se bučno</b>” if you’re in a loud environment, but you can say <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>sj<u>e</u>ćam se loše</b> if you don’t feel well. Note that for some feelings, there is more than one way to express them:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Umoran sam.</b> <i>I’m tired.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>O</u>sj<u>e</u>ćam se umorno.</b> <i>I feel tired.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Note that the second way doesn’t reveal the sex of the speaker, since it uses no adjectives.</p>\n<p>To <em>ask how</em> someone feels, use <b class=\"hrv\">kako</b>, but don’t forget <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Kako</b> se <u>o</u>sj<u>e</u>ćaš?</b> <i>How do you feel?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Dobro.</b> <i>Alright.</i> (<i>‘Good.’</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s an interesting way to ask about ‘situation’:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako je?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_kako_je_s')\"> ▶ </a>\nlit. <i>‘How is it?’</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b>?</b> lit. <i>‘How is it going?’</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Such questions mostly mean <i>how are you (doing)</i>. However, if we add a place, then we’re asking about a general information somewhere:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako je na <span class=\"hc-dl\">poslu</span>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_kako_je_na_poslu_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>How is it going at work?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> na <span class=\"hc-dl\">poslu</span>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_kako_ide_na_poslu_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n(more or less the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>An answer can be a general description, what is done there, nothing necessarily personal. But if we add a person in DL, the questions become specific, <em>about someone’s experience</em> there:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"2\">ti</b> je na <span class=\"hc-dl\">poslu</span>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_kako_ti_je_na_poslu_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>How are you doing at work?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b> na <span class=\"hc-dl\">poslu</span>?</b> <i>How is Ana doing at work?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It seems to me there’s a subtle difference in these two questions: ones with <b class=\"hrv\">ići</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ide</b>) <i>go</i> are more specific about the work done, while ones with <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> are a bit more about everything, (e.g. co-workers, salary, etc.). The sentences are impersonal, verbs are always in the 3rd person, singular, no matter what we add in DL (if anything):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"3pl\">im</b> <b class=\"tt\">ide<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> na <span class=\"hc-dl\">poslu</span>?</b>\n<i>How are they doing at work?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are two often used expressions that cannot be used without someone in DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Drago</b> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_drago_mi_je_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m glad.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Žao</b> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('23_ec_zao_mi_je_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I’m sorry.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, instead of <b class=\"hrv\">mi</b>², other pronouns and nouns in DL can be used:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b> je žao.</b> <i>Ana is sorry.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The first expression is used when you are introduced to someone (like <i>I’m glad to meet you</i>) and the second one is the usual way to express that you are sorry (when something bad happens to someone else).</p>\n<p>This construction with DL is used <em>only</em> for statements that can be either general or subjective. For instance, you <em>cannot</em> say <b class=\"hrv\">gladno mi je</b> since there’s no statement <b class=\"hrv\">gladno je</b> – hunger is not an objective, external situation (at least in Croatian language).</p>\n<p>However, it’s possible to take statements like these:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hc-n\"><span class=\"gender-f\">Ob<u>i</u>telj</span></b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">važna</span>.</b> <i>The family is important.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Knjiga</span> je <span class=\"hc-n\">dosadna</span>.</b> <i>The book is boring.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Majica</span> je <span class=\"hc-n\">l<s>i</s>jepa</span>.</b> <i>The shirt is nice.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>And convert them into <em>personal opinions</em>, using DL in the exactly same way:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hc-n\"><span class=\"gender-f\">Ob<u>i</u>telj</span></b> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">važna</span>.</b>\n<i>The family is important <u>to me</u>.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">knjiga dosadna</span>.</b>\n<i>The book is boring ‘to Ana’.</i> = <i>Ana finds the book boring.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Majica</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">l<s>i</s>jepa</span>.</b> (colloq.) \n  <i>The shirt is nice ‘to me’.</i> = <i>I find the shirt nice.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>While English uses such expressions only with certain adjectives (e.g. <i>important</i>) in Croatian, they are much more widely used, especially in the spoken language. (It’s seen less often in formal writing, with adjectives like <b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jep</b> <i>beautiful, nice</i>, such use of DL is regarded as colloquial.) We again see that the Croatian DL case often corresponds to English <i>to</i> + noun or pronoun.</p>\n<p>Such expressions are often used to express what English expresses with <i>favorite</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\"><u>o</u>m<u>i</u>ljena</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> knjiga</span>.</b> <i>‘This a beloved book.’</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\"><u>o</u>m<u>i</u>ljena</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> knjiga</span>.</b>\n<i>This is my favorite book.</i> (<i>‘beloved to me’</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">ovo</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\"><u>o</u>m<u>i</u>ljena</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> pjesma</span>.</b> <i>This is Ana’s favorite song.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The adjective <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>m<u>i</u>ljen</b> doesn’t really mean <i>favorite</i>, it’s more <i>beloved</i>, <i>popular</i>, <i>preferred</i>.</p>\n<p>You can express the same using a possessive adjective, but it’s less common in speech:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Anina</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> <u>o</u>m<u>i</u>ljena</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> knjiga</span>.</b> <i>This is Ana’s favorite book.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Instead of the adjective <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>m<u>i</u>ljen</b>, you’ll hear also these adjectives in this role:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">n<u>a</u>jb<u>o</u>lji</b> <i>best</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">n<u>a</u>jdr<u>a</u>ži</b> <i>most liked, most dear</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">n<u>a</u>jdr<u>a</u>ža</b></b><span class=\"hc-n\"> pjesma</span>. <i>This is my most favorite song.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(The use of <b class=\"hrv\">n<u>a</u>jb<u>o</u>lji</b> <i>best</i> in these expressions is quite colloquial. These two adjectives, starting with <b class=\"hrv\">naj-</b>, are <em>superlatives</em>; they will be described in 63 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"63.html\">Bigger and Better: Comparatives</a>.)</p>\n<p>There are a couple of verbs that behave kind of similar to expressions above. The most important one is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">trebati</b> <i>need/should</i>\n</p>\n<p>When used with the meaning <i>need</i>, it can be used simply as any verb that uses the accusative case:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Trebam <span class=\"hc-a\">čašu</span>.</b> (A) <i>I need a glass.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>However, it’s a bit more common to use this verb with <em>what you need as the subject</em> (in N) and <em>one who needs</em> in DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Treba <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">čaša</span>.</b> (N) (the same meaning!)\n</p></div>\n<p>Observe how the verb in the second sentence is in the <em>pres-3</em> form, since <b class=\"hrv\">čaša</b> <i>glass</i> is its subject!<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#23-trebati\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>Then, there are two verbs which express something or somebody is <i>lacking</i> or <i>missing</i>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ned<u>o</u>staje</b>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">faliti</b> (colloq.)</td>\n<td class=\"brack nopad\"> </td>\n<td class=\"vcent nopad\">  <i>lack/miss</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">faliti</b> is quite colloquial, but you’ll see it in fiction books and hear it in songs. These verbs are used with what is missing as the subject:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedan</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> <b class=\"gender-m\">dio</b></span> <b class=\"tt\">ned<u>o</u>staje<b class=\"ttb\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b></b>.</b> <i>A part is missing.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Both are very often used with experiencers in DL, one <em>who feels something is missing, or is affected by it</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedan</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> <b class=\"gender-m\">dio</b></span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"2\">ti</b> <b class=\"tt\">ned<u>o</u>staje<b class=\"ttb\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b></b>.</b> <i>You’re missing a part.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Ned<u>o</u>staje<b class=\"ttb\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">Igor</span>.</b> <i>I miss Igor.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>What or who is missing is always the subject, in N (which is usually not expressed, if it’s a pronoun), which is completely <em>unlike</em> in English:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Ned<u>o</u>staješ<b class=\"ttb\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b></b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b>.</b> <i>I miss you.</i> (<i>you</i> = one person)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Fališ <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b>.</b> (the same, but colloquial)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Ned<u>o</u>stajete<b class=\"ttb\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b></b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"3f\">joj</b>.</b> <i>She misses you.</i> (<i>you</i> = group/formal to one person)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Falite <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"3f\">joj</b>.</b> (the same, but colloquial)\n</p></div>\n<p>This is the same as in French, where the verb <em>manquer</em> also uses what is missed as the subject. The same happens with the Italian verb <em>mancare</em>. In German, the verb <em>fehlen</em> behaves in the same way:</p>\n<table>\n<tr><td>(French)</td><td><i>Tu <u>me</u> manques.</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td>(German)  </td><td><i>Du fehlst <u>mir</u>.</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td>(Italian)</td><td><i><u>Mi</u> manchi.</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td> </td><td><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Ned<u>o</u>staješ<b class=\"ttb\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b></b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b>.</b> <i>I miss you.</i></td></tr>\n</table>\n<p>German here uses the Dative case (<em>mir</em>), which matches the Croatian grammar exactly. However, in French and German, subject pronouns are mandatory, while Italian is more like Croatian. The French verb <em>manquer</em> also covers meanings <i>miss the bus</i>, <i>miss the chance</i>; the Croatian verb doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s a way to express that there’s enough of something, or too little or too much:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">dosta</b> je</b>² + G <i>there’s enough G</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">pr<u>e</u>v<u>i</u>še</b> je</b>² + G <i>there’s too much G</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">pr<u>e</u>m<u>a</u>lo</b> je</b>² + G <i>there’s too little G</i>\n</p>\n<p>This is used mainly with uncountable nouns (e.g. <i>salt</i>, <i>sugar</i>, <i>coffee</i>) and persons. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pr<u>e</u>v<u>i</u>še je</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">šećera</span> u <span class=\"hc-dl\">kavi</span>.</b> <i>There’s too much sugar in the coffee.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Again, you can add <em>who</em> feels it in DL. The expression <b class=\"hrv\">dosta je</b> + DL usually translates as <i>had enough (of)</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-dl\">Ani</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">je dosta</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">kave</span>.</b> <i>Ana had enough (of) coffee.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>As in English, this also implies negative emotions:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-dl\">Ani</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">je dosta</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">Damira</span>.</b> <i>Ana had enough of Damir.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Dosta</b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> <b class=\"ft-g\" data-tip=\"3m/n\">ga</b> je.</b> <i>I had enough of him.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Pay attention how words <b class=\"hrv\">mi</b>² (DL), <b class=\"hrv\">ga</b>² (G) and <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² (a verb) are ordered in the second sentence – there’s only one possible order.</p>\n<p>For countable nouns, the same expression will work, but you must use genitive plural – the form I didn’t explain yet.</p>\n<p>So far, we have seen three uses of the DL case (without prepositions, on its own). One was a <em>recipient</em> of something (1), another was person who is somehow <em>involved</em> in the action, usually because he or she is connected to the object (a body part, a personal item, kin) (2), and this one is about <em>personal impressions and feelings</em> (3):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n(1) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">daje<b class=\"ttb\">davati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">šalicu</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b>.</b> <i>Ana is giving a cup to Goran.</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#23-salica\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n(2) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"tt\">p<u>e</u>re<b class=\"ttb\">prati</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">kosu</span>.</b> <i>Ana is washing Goran’s hair.</i>\n</p><p>\n(3) <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Goranu</b> je hladno.</b> <i>Goran is cold.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>As you can see, in all these uses, DL represents a person who is <em>not</em> causing something to happen, but who is somehow <em>affected</em> while not being really an object. (The object in (1) is a cup, and the object in (2) is the hair.)</p>\n<p>______</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"23-trebati\">® Using <b class=\"hrv\">trebati</b> with DL seems preferred in Standard Serbian.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"23-salica\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">šalica</b>, in Serbia and Bosnia, <b class=\"hrv\">šolja</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">šoljica</b> are used for <i>cup</i>.</p>\n<!--##QUIZ##-->\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Answ_23()\n{ var Answ=[\"nam\",\"mi\",\"Goranu\",\"Drago\",\"nam\",\"Osjećam\",\"se\",\"nam\",\"je\",\"nam\",\"mi\",\"je\",\"Majica\",\"ti\",\"je\"];

Croatian has essentially the same two words, however they change in cases. Here are forms for the Croatian equivalent of <i>who</i>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\">people<br/>(<i>who</i>)</th>\n<th class=\"hc-n\">N</th>\n<th><span class=\"hc-a\">A</span>, <span class=\"hc-g\">G</span></th>\n<th class=\"last hc-dl\">DL</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"vtop\"><b class=\"hrv\">tko</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_tko_s')\"> ▶ </a></td>\n<td class=\"vtop\"><b class=\"hrv\">kog</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>)\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_koga_s')\"> ▶ </a></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kom</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">e</b>)\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_kome_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<br/>(<b class=\"hrv\">komu</b>)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The final <b class=\"hrv\">a</b> in <b class=\"hrv\">koga</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">e</b> in <b class=\"hrv\">kome</b> can be dropped, but the longer versions are used quite often. Colloquially, especially in certain regions, <b class=\"hrv\">tko</b> is simplified to just <b class=\"hrv\">ko</b> <a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_ko_s')\"> ▶ </a>.<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#28-ko\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>The DL <b class=\"hrv\">komu</b> is less common in speech, but some style guides prefer it in writing. You can safely ignore it.</p>\n<p>The question-words are placed to the first position and must be put into the exact case, for instance:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Ivan</b> je vozio.</b>\n<i>Ivan was driving.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">Ivan</b> N)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Tko</b> je vozio?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_tko_je_vozio_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Who was driving?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">To</span> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n subj\">Ana</b>.</b>\n<i>That’s Ana.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">Ana</b> N)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n subj\">Tko</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">to</span>?</b>\n<i>Who’s that?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>For the accusative case (contrasted with the question about the subject in N):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> čeka <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Anu</b>.</b>\n<i>Goran is waiting for Ana.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">Anu</b> A)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Koga</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> čeka?</b>\n<i>Who is Goran waiting for?</i> (A)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Tko</b> čeka <b class=\"hc-a\">Anu</b>?</b>\n<i>Who is waiting for Ana?</i> (N)\n</p></div>\n<p>English questions could also be written with <i>whom</i> (<i>whom is Goran...</i> ) – that’s recommended by many use guides, but increasingly rare in real life. You could think about <i>whom</i> as an almost extinct object case form of <i>who</i>, corresponding to Croatian A and DL.</p>\n<p>Examples for the DL case:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je pisala <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ivanu</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana was writing to Ivan.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">Ivanu</b> = DL)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Kome</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> pisala?</b>\n<i>Who was Ana writing to?</i>\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Knjiga</span> pr<u>i</u>p<u>a</u>da <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b>.</b>\n<i>The book belongs to Ana.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">Ani</b> = DL)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Kome</b> pr<u>i</u>p<u>a</u>da <span class=\"hc-n\">knjiga</span>?</b>\n<i>Who does the book belong to?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s no special placement of verbs or any other words in Croatian questions, except that the question word must be at the first position.</p>\n<p>If you are asking about something that’s obviously not a person, you would use another question word (I’ve already introduced its nominative form):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\">things<br/>(<i>what</i>)</th>\n<th><span class=\"hc-n\">N</span>, <span class=\"hc-a\">A</span></th>\n<th class=\"hc-dl\">DL</th>\n<th class=\"last hc-g\">G</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">što</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_ssto_s')\"> ▶ </a></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">čemu</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_cemu_s')\"> ▶ </a></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">čega</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_cega_s')\"> ▶ </a></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>As said before, in many regions, <b class=\"hrv\">šta</b> <a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_sta_s')\"> ▶ </a> is used colloquially instead of <b class=\"hrv\">što</b>.<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#28-ko\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a> Also, in the Zagreb region, <b class=\"hrv\">kaj</b> is used colloquially.</p>\n<p>Pay attention how with <b class=\"hrv\">tko</b>, A = G, while <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> has A = N (as with neuter nouns and adjectives in neuter gender!)</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je pisala <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">pismo</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana was writing a letter.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">pismo</b> = A)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Što</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> pisala?</b>\n<i>What was Ana writing?</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">što</b> = A)\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> se <b class=\"tt\">b<u>o</u>ji<b class=\"ttb\">bojati se</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-g\">mraka</b>.</b>\n<i>Ivan is afraid of dark.</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">mraka</b> = G)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-g\">Čega</b> se <b class=\"tt\">b<u>o</u>ji<b class=\"ttb\">bojati se</b></b> <span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span>?</b>\n<i>What is Ivan afraid of?</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">čega</b> = G)\n</p></div>\n<p>When answering such questions, you can answer with just one word, but in the right case:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Kome</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> pisala?</b>\n<i>Who was Ana writing to?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ivanu</b>.</b>\n<i>To Ivan.</i> (DL)\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Što</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> pisala?</b>\n<i>What was Ana writing?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Pismo</b>.</b>\n<i>A letter.</i> (A)\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Koga</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> čeka?</b>\n<i>Who is Goran waiting for?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Anu</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana.</i> (A)\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-g\">Čega</b> se <b class=\"tt\">b<u>o</u>ji<b class=\"ttb\">bojati se</b></b> <span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span>?</b>\n<i>What is Ivan afraid of?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc hc-g\">Mraka</b>.</b>\n<i>Dark.</i> (G)\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s possible to ask questions about any \"slot\" in a sentence, normally occupied by a noun, including one after prepositions. Then the preposition will be before the question word (like in a kind of ultra-formal English):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bili smo <b class=\"hrvc\">kod <span class=\"hc-g\">Ane</span></b>.</b>\n<i>We were at Ana’s house/home.</i> {m/mixed} (<b class=\"hrv\">kod</b>¨ + G)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Kod <span class=\"hc-g\">koga</span></b> smo bili?</b>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">Kod <span class=\"hc-g\">Ane</span></b>.</b>\n<i>At Ana’s house/home.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now, you have to answer with the right preposition <em>and</em> the noun in the right case!</p>\n<p>Since <b class=\"hrv\">tko</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> can be used as <em>subjects</em> in questions, what forms of verbs and other words do we have to use with them? It turns out to be quite simple and like in English (and unlike in Spanish, where <em>quiénes</em> is used to ask about plural):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">tko</b> = masculine sing., 3rd person<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">što</b> = neuter sing., 3rd person\n</p>\n<p>Therefore, even if you are asking about someone who is obviously female, or if the answer is obviously more than one person, you should always set up the question in the masculine gender, singular:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Tko</b> je <b class=\"hrvc\">bio</b> ovdje?</b>\n<i>Who was here?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Tko</b> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">gladan</b>?</b>\n<i>Who is hungry?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Tko</span> je <b class=\"hc-n subj\">to</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">bio</b>?</b>\n<i>Who was that?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>For things:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Što</b> je <span class=\"hc-n subj\">to</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">bilo</b>?</b>\n<i>What was that?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Šta</b> je <span class=\"hc-n subj\">to</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">bilo</b>?</b>\n(the same meaning, but colloquial)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#28-ko\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>That’s very similar to English, where you ask in singular even if it’s obvious the answer will be more than one person.</p>\n<p>Another example: to ask about which body part hurts, you have to use <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> as the subject, since body parts are <em>subjects</em> in such sentences, while the person feeling the pain is grammatically the <em>object</em> (in A). Consequently, in questions, <em>past</em> forms must be neuter singular, and in answers the body part is in N:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Što</b> <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2\">te</b> b<u>o</u>li?</b>\nlit. ‘<i>What hurts you?</i>’ = <i>Where does it hurt you?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Zub</b>.</b> <i>A tooth.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Što</b> je boljelo <span class=\"hc-a\">Anu</span>?</b>\nlit. ‘<i>What did hurt Ana?</i>’ = <i>Where did it hurt Ana?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Ruka</b>.</b> <i>Hand/arm.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> is a <em>pronoun</em>, it cannot be attached to a noun. You cannot use it to ask e.g. <i>What movie are you watching?</i>. For such purposes, Croatian uses another word, adjective <b class=\"hrv\">koji</b>, explained in 59 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"59.html\">Whose, What Thing and What Like</a>.</p>\n<p>The question-word <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> is used to ask for additional information about what someone is, e.g. what profession:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Što</b> je <span class=\"hc-n subj\">Ivan</span>?</b> <i>What is Ivan?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <span class=\"hc-n\">L<s>i</s>ječnik</span>.</b> <i>Doctor.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>What about animals? For general animals, you should use <b class=\"hrv\">što</b>, but for animals you’re familiar with (e.g. pets) <b class=\"hrv\">tko</b> is often used.</p>\n<p>Recall that <b class=\"hrv\">što</b> is used for generic questions where we know the subject, but not the verb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n(<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">spava</b>.</b> <i>Ana is sleeping.</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Što</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">radi</b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_sto_ana_radi_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>What is Ana doing?</i> (lit. ‘<i>working</i>’)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">Spava</b>.</b> <i>She’s sleeping.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>For general questions <em>what is/was going on</em> – nothing is known – the following two verbs are used (the first one is a bit colloquial)<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#28-desavati\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"nopad\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">deš<u>a</u>vati</b> («) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dog<u>a</u>đati</b> («) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²  </p></td>\n<td class=\"brack nopad\"> </td>\n<td class=\"vcent nopad\">   <i>go on, happen</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Što</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">se d<u>o</u>g<u>a</u>đa</b> ovdje?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_sto_se_dogadja_ovdje_s')\"> S▶ </a>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_sto_se_dogadja_ovdje_w')\"> W▶ </a>\n<i>What is going on here?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Since Croatian has only one present tense, it’s very common to add the all-purpose demonstrative <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> <i>that</i> after question words, usually before the verb, to stress that you’re asking something present, ongoing right now, what or who can be seen:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Što</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">to</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> radi?</b>\n<i>What is Ana doing?</i> \n(right now)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Što</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">to</b> radiš?</b>\n<i>What are you doing?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Šta</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">to</b> radiš?</b>\n(the same meaning, but colloquial)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#28-ko\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Što</span> se <b class=\"hrvc\">to</b> d<u>o</u>g<u>a</u>đa?</b>\n<i>What is going on?</i> (right now)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-dl\">Kome</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">to</b> <b class=\"tt\">pišeš<b class=\"ttb\">p<u>i</u>sati</b></b>?</b>\n<i>Who are you writing to?</i> (I see you’re typing a message) \n</p></div>\n<p>Observe that between the question words and <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> second-position words may appear. This removes the ambiguity of the present tense, as this question is also about someone’s job, depending on the context:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Što</span> radiš?</b>\n<i>What are you doing?</i> / <i>What do you do?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Šta</span> radiš?</b>\n(the same meaning, but colloquial)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#28-ko\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>Such <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> is optional, of course, but makes the question really specific. Even adding <b class=\"hrv\">sad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) <i>now</i> wouldn’t remove the ambiguity, since <b class=\"hrv\">sad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) can stretch to days, weeks, months – depending on the context.</p>\n<p>If you are puzzled what <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> is in such questions, it behaves rather as an adverb or particle, and never changes its form.</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s possible to ask questions what <em>should</em> be, or what <em>should</em> you do, that is, <em>ask for advice or an opinion</em>. There’s a special construction where <b class=\"hrv\">da</b> is put right after the question-word:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Što</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">da</b> <b class=\"tt\">pišem<b class=\"ttb\">p<u>i</u>sati</b></b>?</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('28_sto_da_pisem_s')\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>What should I write?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Koga</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">da</b> čekamo?</b>\n<i>Who should we wait for?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Što</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">da</b> radim?</b>\n<i>What should I do?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Google™ for <b class=\"hrv\">što da radim</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">šta da radim</b> and you’ll see it’s a very frequent expression.)</p>\n<p>The main verb should be in the present tense, as in other questions of this type (<b class=\"hrv\">gdje da...</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">kada da...</b> etc.):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kamo <b class=\"hrvc\">da</b> idemo?</b>\n<i>Where should we go?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The verbs must be in the present tense to use such form.

The word <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> was so much used after the older question word that it eventually fused with it, and lost its meaning. Later the word <b class=\"hrv\">to</b> was introduced again.</p>\n<p>Various versions of the question-word <i>what</i> are used as traditional criteria for dividing various dialects in Croatia.</p>\n<p>Russian, a not-so-distant relative of Croatian, still spells the question word <b class=\"hrv\">что</b> – which is just <b class=\"hrv\">čto</b>, but in Russian Cyrillic script. (However, it’s pronounced <b class=\"hrv\">što</b>, the same as in Croatian!)</p>\n<p>The same happened in <b class=\"hrv\">tko</b> – the older form was <b class=\"hrv\">kto</b>, i.e. <b class=\"hrv\">k</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">to</b>.

      "html": "\n<p>If the world were a simple place, Croatian masculine nouns would have their nominative plural made just by adding an <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>, and accusative plural just by an <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b>. Well, it’s <em>almost so</em>, but there are few twists.</p>\n<p>Most masculine nouns <em>do</em> simply get an <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in nominative plural:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">krevet</b> <i>bed</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">krevet<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b> <i>beds</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prozor</b> <i>window</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">prozor<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b> <i>windows</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">t<u>a</u>nj<u>u</u>r</b> (») <i>plate</i> (to eat from) → \n<b class=\"hrv\">tanj<u>u</u>r<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b> <i>plates</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#29-tanjur\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>What about the <em>accusative case</em>?

It does not happen in the accusative plural, only when an <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> is added (that is, in the N-<em>pl</em>):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">N</th>\n<th>N-<em>pl</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\">A-<em>pl</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">putni<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b></b> <i>traveler</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">putni<b class=\"hrvc\">ci</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">putni<b class=\"hrvc\">ke</b></b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">razlo<b class=\"hrvc\">g</b></b> <i>reason</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">razlo<b class=\"hrvc\">zi</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">razlo<b class=\"hrvc\">ge</b></b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">uspje<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b> <i>success</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">uspje<b class=\"hrvc\">si</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">uspje<b class=\"hrvc\">he</b></b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">prozor</b> <i>window</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prozor<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">prozor<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>However, most <em>one-syllable</em> nouns (that is, nouns that have only one vowel) get a longer ending;

The noun <b class=\"hrv\">đak</b> gets the same alternation as <b class=\"hrv\">putnik</b>, so its N-<em>pl</em> is <b class=\"hrv\">đa<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>i</b>. There are more nouns like that, some will be introduced later.</p>\n<p>There’s a quite odd noun that has different plural forms depending on its meaning:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sat</b> <i>hour</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">sat<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b> <i>hours</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sat</b> <i>clock, watch</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">sat<b class=\"hrvc\">ovi</b></b> <i>clocks, watches</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>The noun <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> <i>pain</i> is usually feminine <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#29-bol\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>, but in plural, the masculine <b class=\"hrv\">bolovi</b> is quite frequent, while regular <b class=\"hrv\">boli</b> is usually used for non-physical pains, and in poetry:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"vcent last\" rowspan=\"2\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> f <i>pain</i> → pl.  \n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bolovi</b> m (physical)\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">boli</b> f (emotional, poetic)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>There are nouns that have two syllables in nominative, but a one-syllable <em>case-base</em>. Most such nouns get short endings, like any other two-syllable nouns:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">glumac</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">glumc-</b>) <i>actor</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">glumc<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">lonac</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">lonc-</b>) <i>pot</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">lonc<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nokat</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">nokt-</b>) <i>fingernail/toenail</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">nokt<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b><br>\n</br></br></br></p>\n<p>However, a few such nouns get longer endings, as one-syllable nouns do; the only option is to remember them (the list below is not exhaustive):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bubanj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">bubnj-</b>) <i>drum</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">bubnj<b class=\"hrvc\">evi</b></b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">češalj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">češlj-</b>) <i>comb</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">češlj<b class=\"hrvc\">evi</b></b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dio</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jel-</b>) <i>part</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#29-dio\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jel<b class=\"hrvc\">ovi</b></b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">lakat</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">lakt-</b>) <i>elbow</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">lakt<b class=\"hrvc\">ovi</b></b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">otac</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">o<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>-</b>) <i>father</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">o<b class=\"hrvc\">čevi</b></b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vjetar</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">vjetr-</b>) <i>wind</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">vjetr<b class=\"hrvc\">ovi</b></b><br>\n</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>\n<p>There are several two-syllable nouns that usually get longer endings. Notably, they include bird species:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">galeb</b> <i>gull</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">golub</b> <i>pidgeon</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">labud</b> <i>swan</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(The <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"/p/d0.html\">Core Dictionary</a> lists all unusual plural forms of nouns included in it.)</p>\n<p>The accusative case for longer plural again has just <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b> instead of the final <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Gledam <span class=\"hc-a\">brodov<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></span>.</b> <i>I’m watching ships.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>A few masculine nouns shift their stress in plural. For some, the behavior depends on the region: this quite common noun in plural has different places of stress in the two most common stress schemes:<p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mjesec</b> <i>moon/month</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">mj<u>e</u>s<u>e</u>ci</b>\n</p>\n<p>One masculine noun has a completely irregular plural, and one more has no real plural but something else that will be explained a bit later:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">čovjek</b> <i>man/human</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">ljudi</b></b> <i>people, men and women</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">brat</b> <i>brother</i> → \n<b class=\"hrvc\">?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The noun <b class=\"hrv\">ljudi</b> has a slightly different meaning than <b class=\"hrv\">čovjek</b>, it’s more generic, and can be often translated as <i>people</i>. It also corresponds to the English phrase <i>men, women and children</i> used to describe a mixed group. In a more narrow sense, it corresponds to <i>men and women</i> (i.e. all adults). You would use two words only when you <em>compare</em> sexes:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrv\">ljudi</b></b> <i>people</i> = <i>men and women</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrv\">mušk<u>a</u>rci i žene</b></b> <i>men and women</i> (focus on sex differences!)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#29-dio\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Warning</em>: if you attempt to translate <i>men and women</i> as <b class=\"hrv\">ljudi i žene</b>, it could sound <em>like an insult</em> – you would basically say that women are non-human. However, this <em>is</em> used in some rural areas of Croatia, where the word <b class=\"hrv\">mušk<u>a</u>rac</b> is rare. <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#29-ljudi-i-zene\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s more: some nouns in N-<em>pl</em> have a bit unexpected – <em>and unsettled</em> – spelling. They have <em>case-base</em> in <b class=\"hrv\">-tk-</b>; for example:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">redak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">retk-</b>) <i>line of text</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tk-</b>) <i>beginning</i>\n</p>\n<p>From everything you have learned so far, you would expect the forms:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first\">\nN</th><th>DL</th><th>N-<em>pl</em></th><th>A-<em>pl</em>\n</th></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">redak</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">retku</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ret<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>i</b></td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">retke</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tak</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tku</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>t<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>i</b></td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tke</b>\n</td></tr><tr></tr></table>\n<p>However, since the sequence <b class=\"hrv\">tc</b> in N-<em>pl</em> is normally pronounced just as <b class=\"hrv\">c</b>, it was traditionally spelled <em>without</em> the <b class=\"hrv\">t</b>. On the contrary, more recent Croatian orthography manuals mandate writing <b class=\"hrv\">tc</b> – and here’s a crazy thing – <b class=\"hrv\">dc</b> if the N has a <b class=\"hrv\">d</b>! So, be prepared to see all possible variants<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#29-retci\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first\">\nN</th><th>DL</th><th>N-<em>pl</em></th><th>A-<em>pl</em>\n</th></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">redak</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">retku</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>i</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">tc</b>i</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">dc</b>i</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">retke</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tak</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tku</b></td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u><b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>i</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u><b class=\"hrvc\">tc</b>i</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tke</b>\n</td></tr><tr></tr></table>\n<p>The most recent Croatian orthography manual allows also <b class=\"hrv\">c</b>-only forms for some frequent nouns, such as:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">gub<u>i</u>tak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">gub<u>i</u>tk-</b>) <i>loss</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ost<u>a</u>tak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ost<u>a</u>tk-</b>) <i>remainder</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>e</u>tk-</b>) <i>beginning</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">predak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pretk-</b>) <i>ancestor</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tren<u>u</u>tak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">tren<u>u</u>tk-</b>) <i>moment</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zad<u>a</u>tak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">zad<u>a</u>tk-</b>) <i>task</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>But the noun <b class=\"hrv\">redak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">retk-</b>) is <em>not</em> one of them! I expect there will be more changes in the future regarding this group of nouns. (Google™ for forms <b class=\"hrv\">preci</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">pretci</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">predci</b> on the .hr domain, to check frequencies. Don’t forget that the most regular form – <b class=\"hrv\">pretci</b> – is non-standard, according to the latest manual.)</p>\n<p>What about adjectives? They are much simpler – they just get the following endings (equal to short endings for nouns) without any complications:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">adjectives</th>\n<th>N-<em>pl</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\">A-<em>pl</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masculine</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrvc\">-i</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrvc\">-e</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p class=\"att\">While the ending <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> is a bit optional for adjectives in N <em>singular</em> of the masculine genders, it has nothing with <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in plural: that ending is <em>mandatory</em>.  Futhermore, <em>all adjectives get the same plural endings</em>, including <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b> <i>my</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">taj</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">t-</b>) <i>that</i> etc. The only ‘weird’ form of adjectives is the masc. singular N.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Gledam <span class=\"hc-a\">velik<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></span><span class=\"hc-a\"> brod<b class=\"hrvc\">ove</b></span>.</b> <i>I’m watching big ships.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> ima <span class=\"hc-a\">prljav<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></span><span class=\"hc-a\"> lakt<b class=\"hrvc\">ove</b></span>.</b> <i>Goran has dirty elbows.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This applies to past forms of verbs as well:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ps<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></span> su bil<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">gladn<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></span>.</b> <i>Dogs were hungry.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"29-tanjur\">® Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">t<u>a</u>nj<u>u</u>r</b> (») <i>plate</i>, a slightly different word <b class=\"hrv\">t<u>a</u>nj<u>i</u>r</b> (») is used in Serbia and most of Bosnia.

Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">kut</b>, the word <b class=\"hrv\">ugao</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ugl-</b>) is used for <i>angle, corner</i> in Serbia. That word is used in Bosnia and sometimes in Croatia as well; you can find also <b class=\"hrv\">kut</b> in Bosnia.</p>\n<p>Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">gumb</b>, the word <b class=\"hrv\">dugme</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dugmet-</b>) is used for <i>button</i> in Bosnia and Serbia. It’s also used in Croatia, although <b class=\"hrv\">gumb</b> is more common, especially in western regions of Croatia. Unfortunately, <b class=\"hrv\">dugme</b>, like <b class=\"hrv\">brat</b> <i>brother</i>, is one of these words which don’t really have a plural and which will be explained later!

Nouns <b class=\"hrv\">sin</b> <i>son</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">dom</b> <i>home</i> were among them (they had a bit different shape back then). They had special case endings, some of them containing <b class=\"hrv\">-ov-</b>.</p>\n<p>From these nouns, the inserted <b class=\"hrv\">-ov-</b> in plural has spread to almost all one-syllable masculine nouns.</p>\n<p>Athough almost all recenty introduced nouns follow the rules for plural, at least one doesn’t: the plural of <b class=\"hrv\">gen</b> <i>gene</i> is <b class=\"hrv\">geni</b>, not <b class=\"hrv\">genovi</b>!</p>\n<p>Croatian standard language manuals universally condemn forms like <b class=\"hrv\">noseve</b> (A-<em>pl</em> of <b class=\"hrv\">nos</b>), despite that form being 7 times more common (on the Internet) than <b class=\"hrv\">nosove</b>, since they break the rule when the <b class=\"hrv\">e</b>-endings are used. In speech, forms <b class=\"hrv\">nosevi</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">noseve</b> prevail almost completely.

You’ll see below.)</p>\n<p>As in English, possessives often come before the number; since they are really adjectives, they must get special endings as well:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-2\">Tvoj<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></span><span class=\"hc-2\"> dvije</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> knjig<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></span> <b class=\"hrvc\">su</b> kod <span class=\"hc-g\">Ane</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_tvoje_2_knjige_su_kod_ane')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Your two books are at Ana’s place.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-2\">Moj<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></span><span class=\"hc-2\"> tri</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> prijatelj<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></span> <b class=\"hrvc\">su</b> ovdje.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_moja_3_prijatelja_su_ovdje')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>My three friends are here.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This implies that plural is used in Croatian less than in English. For example:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva čovjeka</b> <i>two men</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tri djeteta</b> <i>three children</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva brata</b> <i>two brothers</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">četiri broja</b> <i>four numbers</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>As you can see, you talk about children and brothers without using their plural forms (which are yet unexplained) if there’s not more than four of them:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <span class=\"hc-2\">dva</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> brata</span> i <span class=\"hc-a\">jednu</span><span class=\"hc-a\"> sestru</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_imam_2_brata_i_1_sestru')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I have two brothers and a sister.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>However, <em>numbers are mandatory</em>. If there’s no number 2 to 4, you <em>have to use plural forms</em>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you don’t know the exact number, it could be 2, it could be 3; one way to express it is by joining numbers:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\">dva-tri</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">piva</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_imam_2_3_piva')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I have two or three beers.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\">dvije-tri</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">jabuke</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_imam_2_3_jabuke')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I have two or three apples.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You will see this written with a comma instead of hyphen, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">dva, tri</b>. It’s also common to join numbers 3 and 4 (<b class=\"hrv\">tri-četiri</b>).</p>\n<p>There’s a twist: I’ve written above that <em>numbers adapt to the gender of the noun</em>. And I’ve written that <b class=\"hrv\">dva prijatelja</b> means <i>two friends</i>.</p>\n<p>That’s not the full story. The numbers described above cannot adapt in some circumstances.</p>\n<p>In the case of mixed groups of people, where masculine nouns are used as a default (e.g. when you use <b class=\"red\">prijatelji</b> <i>friends</i> for a group of friends of mixed sex), you <em>cannot</em> use the numbers I have just described! This restriction holds <em>even</em> for <b class=\"hrv\">četiri</b>, a form common for both genders.</p>\n<p>That’s because Croatian has a <em>specific set</em> of numbers used for mixed groups or people, also used to count children: they are described in detail in 49 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"49.html\">Of Flowers, Thorns and Counting Children</a>. Now, <em>don’t</em> jump to that chapter: with these numbers, you’ll need a case form we haven’t covered yet. (And it turns out it’s the most complicated case form in Croatian.) Until then, maybe you could stick to only all-male or all-female groups of friends.</p>\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n (both male)</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv hc-2\">dva</b><b class=\"hrv hc-2\"> prijatelja</b> <i>two friends</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n(both female)</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv hc-2\">dvije</b><b class=\"hrv hc-2\"> prijat<u>e</u>ljice</b> <i>two friends</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n(mixed)</td><td class=\"last\"> ? → will be explained\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>However, if you are talking about <em>animals</em>, you can and should use the numbers above even for mixed groups. For example, <b class=\"red\">konji</b> <i>horses</i> can mean an all-male group, or a mixed group, so you’re free to say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva konja</b> <i>two horses</i> (all-male or mixed)\n</p></div>\n<p>Now, there’s a word that’s quite common in Croatian: <b class=\"red\">još</b>. We have seen it long ago. It’s also used with numbers: you can place if before any quantity, to indicate it’s an additional quantity:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ž<u>e</u>lim <span class=\"hc-2\">dvije</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> jabuke</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_zelim_dvije_jabuke')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I want two apples.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ž<u>e</u>lim <b class=\"hrvc\">još</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">dvije</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> jabuke</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_zelim_jos_dvije_jabuke')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I want two apples <u>more</u>.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Don’t forget, if you place it before a verb, it has another meaning – <i>still</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Još</b> ž<u>e</u>lim <span class=\"hc-2\">dvije</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> jabuke</span>.</b>\n<i>I <u>still</u> want two apples.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are two more useful words that are often used before quantities:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bar</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">barem</b> <i>at least</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čak</b> <i>even</i>, <i>as much as</i>\n</p>\n<p>There’s no difference between <b class=\"hrv\">bar</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">barem</b>. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Trebam <b class=\"hrvc\">bar</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">dvije</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> čaše</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_trebam_bar_2_case')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I need at least two glasses.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#30-trebati\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\">čak</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">tri</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> tanj<u>u</u>ra</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_imam_cak_3_tanjura')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I have even three plates.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#30-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>So, you can finally order food and drink (basically all waiters in Croatia speak English as well, so you could do it without any knowledge of Croatian as well). The most common conversation would be something along these lines:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imate li</b> (A) <b class=\"hrv\">?</b> <i>Do you have...?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— Imamo.</b> <i>We have.</i> / <b class=\"hrv\">— Nemamo.</b> <i>We don’t.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Što imate?</b> <i>What do you have?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> </b> (A) = a polite way to ask for something\n</p></div>\n<p>For example, the last line could be:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">dvije</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> kave</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_molim_vas_2_kave')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Two coffees, please.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#30-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">tri</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> mala</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> piva</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_molim_vas_3_mala_piva')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Three small beers, please.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">jedan</span><span class=\"hc-a\"> hamburger</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_molim_vas_1_hamburger')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>One burger, please.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">dva</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> čaja</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_molim_vas_2_caja')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Two cups of tea, please.</i> (lit. <i>‘two teas’</i>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">tri</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> velike</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> pizze</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_molim_vas_3_velike_pizze')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Three large pizzas, please.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Normally, we don’t say <i>cup of coffee</i>, <i>bottle of beer</i> etc. when we are ordering food, because there’s no other option. But when ordering food that’s served on the plate, and it’s not pizza, the word <b class=\"hrv\">porcija</b> <i>serving, portion</i> is often used. Of course, what you are ordering comes after <b class=\"hrv\">porcija</b>, in G, while the word <b class=\"hrv\">porcija</b> changes to A or to the 24 form:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> (<span class=\"hc-a\">jednu</span>) <span class=\"hc-a\">porciju</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">piletine</span>.</b> <i>One serving of chicken, please.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> <span class=\"hc-2\">dvije</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> porcije</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">piletine</span>.</b> <i>Two servings of chicken, please.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The number <i>one</i> is optional, but it’s often used in such sentences.</p>\n<p>You’re maybe puzzed what the word <b class=\"hrv\">piletina</b> exactly is. It’s a word meaning <i>chicken meat</i>, like English <i>pork</i> means <i>pig meat</i>. You don’t ask for “pig” in a restaurant, you ask for <i>pork</i>.</p>\n<p>The same holds for <i>wine</i>, you can sometimes order it by glasses:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> (<span class=\"hc-a\">jednu</span>) <span class=\"hc-a\">čašu</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">vina</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_molim_vas_1_casu_vina')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>A glass of wine, please.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Note you’re counting glasses now, the word <b class=\"hrv\">vino</b> <i>wine</i> is always in G.)</p>\n<p>Of course, you can always order more:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> još <span class=\"hc-2\">dva</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> piva</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('30_molim_vas_jos_2_piva')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Two more beers, please.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Finally, it’s interesting that the verb <b class=\"hrv\">moliti</b> has <em>two</em> objects in such sentences, and <em>both</em> are in A: the person asked, and what is asked.</p>\n<p>There’s another way of asking for (and offering) food and drink, and it will be introduced in the following chapters, but we’ll visit some interesting things first.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"30-trebati\">® The verb <b class=\"hrv\">trebati</b> <i>need</i> is used in Serbia in the inverse way (which is also common, but not mandatory in Croatia); in Serbia, the example would be <b class=\"hrv\">trebaju mi bar dve čaše</b> (also, note the “Ekavian” form <b class=\"hrv\">dve</b> for 2 f).</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"30-vocab\">\n<p>Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">t<u>a</u>nj<u>u</u>r</b> (») <i>plate</i> (to eat from), a slightly different word <b class=\"hrv\">t<u>a</u>nj<u>i</u>r</b> (») is used in Serbia and most of Bosnia. In the coastal areas of Croatia, you’ll often hear <b class=\"hrv\">pjat</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">pijat</b> for <i>plate</i>.</p>\n<p>Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">kava</b>, a slightly different word <b class=\"hrv\">kafa</b> is common in most parts of Bosnia and Serbia.

      "html": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\" id=\"post-body-9117371448629198157\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<p>If you look into a Croatian dictionary and look for a word for <i>clothes iron</i> (the thing to iron your shirt), very likely, you’ll find the word <b class=\"hrv\">glačalo</b>. However, that word is extremely rare in real use: a large majority uses another word, <b class=\"hrv\">pegla</b> (there’s yet another word for that term, which will be explained later).</p>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">glačalo</b> is considered ‘standard’ and will be used only in formal circumstances, in written formal language; in casual writing, even in newspapers, <b class=\"hrv\">pegla</b> dominates, it’s more than 20 times more common. We say that the word <b class=\"hrv\">pegla</b> is <em>colloquial</em>.</p>\n<p>But what do ‘standard’ and ‘colloquial’ really mean? The ‘standard’ is a form of Croatian taught in schools, used on Public TV news and in some newspapers, and advertised in style manuals. It’s considered ‘proper’, and some people get angry when anyone uses anything else. However, most people use something a bit different in almost all situations. In reality, there are ‘layered cakes’ of ways people write and speak:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">setting</th>\n<th>‘standard’</th>\n<th class=\"last\">‘colloquial’</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first vcent\">formal</td>\n<td>news on Public radio<br/>news on Public TV<br/>some Croatian teachers<br/>some professors...</td>\n<td class=\"last\">formal occassions<br/>entertaiment shows on TV<br/>TV interviews<br/>lectures at university...</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">normal</td>\n<td>some movies<br/>some books<br/>newspapers<br/>scientific articles<br/>some professors...</td>\n<td class=\"last\">at work<br/>most daily situations<br/>local radio stations<br/>partially movies and books<br/>Facebook, portals, blogs...</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">‘relaxed’</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td class=\"last\">with friends, having fun<br/>dialogues in some novels<br/>Facebook, some blogs...</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The ‘standard’ column means using all forms and words considered ‘proper’ – <em>only them</em> – and pronouncing them in the ‘proper’ way. Virtually nobody does that in daily life. Speeches by the members of Croatian Parliament aren’t like that. Judges in courts of law don’t speak like that. But there’s some writing like that, because it’s easier to write in a prescribed way than to speak. And if you don’t really write in the ‘proper’ way, someone can proof your writing and ‘correct’ it. And to assist in ‘correcting’, there are thick style manuals – sometimes approaching a thousand pages – and a zillion web pages, something having simply tables with two columns – ‘proper’ and ‘wrong’.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, I’ll focus on the middle and the top cake layers: the ‘relaxed’ way of speaking will be explained later, as you don’t need it to understand most writing and speech, and you likely won’t be able to speak Croatian in a ‘relaxed’ way for a while.</p>\n<p>English has also ‘proper’ <em>isn’t</em> and ‘wrong’ <em>ain’t</em> – but the ‘proper’ form prevails completely in writing, on TV, in books, on web sites and in most public situations – and you can safely go to England or US and use <em>isn’t</em> all the time, and never sound odd. You will eventually learn <em>ain’t</em>, e.g. to understand the song <em>Ain’t No Sunshine</em>.</p>\n<p>Not so in Croatia. There are many things which are standard – ‘proper’ in style manuals – but almost never used in speech, and you <em>will</em> sound odd if you use them. There are standard nouns that are almost never used in speech, for example:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Std. Croatian</th>\n<th class=\"last\">colloq.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>airplane</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">zrakoplov</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">av<u>i</u><u>o</u>n</b> (»)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>fridge</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">hladnjak</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">friž<u>i</u>d<u>e</u>r</b> (»)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>elevator</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">dizalo</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">lift</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>If you do a Google™ search on the .hr domain for the phrases <b class=\"hrv\">u liftu</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">u dizalu</b> (both meaning <i>in elevator</i>, of course), you’ll get results like these:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u liftu</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">34600</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u dizalu</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">3480</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Such results, 10:1 in favor of the ‘colloquial’ word – <em>in writing!</em> – are common: many colloquial words prevail even in newspapers and fiction books, including translations. However, you will see the rare ‘standard’ word from time to time.</p>\n<p>Even worse are some subtle differences between Standard Croatian and ‘colloquial’ forms. One example is the word <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> <i>pain</i>: most manuals suggest it ‘should’ be <em>masculine</em> (inanimate, of course) when it means <i>physical pain</i>, and <em>feminine</em> when it stands for emotional pain.</p>\n<p>This advice is <em>ignored by almost everyone in Croatia</em> – including medical textbook writers, government agencies, universities, newspapers, pharmaceutical companies, etc. Just check these results for <i>acute pain</i> (24:1 in favor of feminine) and <i>chronic pain</i> (50:1 in favor of feminine):</p>\n<table><tr><td>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">akutna bol</b> (f)</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">1400</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">akutni bol</b> (m)<br/><b class=\"hrv\">akutan bol</b> (m)</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">52<br/>5</td>\n</tr></table>\n</td><td>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">kronična bol</b> (f)</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">8500</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">kronični bol</b> (m)<br/><b class=\"hrv\">kroničan bol</b> (m)</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">100<br/>70</td>\n</tr></table>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(The masculine constructions above have two forms, due to the optional <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> on adjectives.)</p>\n<p>So, it’s safe to say that masculine <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> is today marginal in Croatia, even in writing – except in Standard Croatian grammars and style guides. (Of course, the word <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> usually switches its gender in plural to masculine.)</p>\n<p>(It’s also interesting that feminine <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> has been used in writing in Croatia since 1468.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Standard Croatian uses a whole phrase, while in everyday use, there is a simple word:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Std. Croatian</th>\n<th class=\"last\">colloq.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>whipped cream</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tučeno slatko vrhnje</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">šlag</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>semolina</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">pšenična krupica</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">griz</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>It’s interesting that some manuals insist on the spelling <b class=\"hrv\">gris</b> (see Examples).</p>\n<p>Sometimes, standard and colloquial forms happily coexist. For example, the following adjectives are common but colloquial; however standard words are also often used in real life:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Std. Croatian</th>\n<th class=\"last\">colloq.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>fresh</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">svjež</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">friški</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>violet</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">ljubičast</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">lila</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>pink</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">ružičast</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">roza</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>There are couple of verbs as well, again the standard words are heard as well:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Std. Croatian</th>\n<th class=\"last\">colloq.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>lack, miss</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ned<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>je</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">faliti</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>fry</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">pržiti</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">frigati</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>There are some nouns that are specific to Croatian, and feel more formal, but they are used alongside other, international-sounding nouns, and there’s even a small difference in meaning (that’s not always observed):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>library</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">knjižnica</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">bibliot<u>e</u>ka</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>music</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">glazba</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">muzika</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>system</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">sustav</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">s<u>i</u>st<u>e</u>m</b> (»)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Then, there are some verbs that are usually used in a form that’s slightly different than in a (Standard Croatian) dictionary. Two common verbs are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Std.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">colloq.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>count</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">br<u>o</u>jiti</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">brojati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">br<u>o</u>ji</b>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>paint</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">b<u>o</u>jiti</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">bojati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">b<u>o</u>ji</b>)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>On the internet, colloquial forms are 3-4 times more common than the standard forms (which are basically limited to newspapers, books, and official writings), and the colloquial forms completely prevail in speech. The meaning <i>paint</i> above doesn’t include art, only when you paint a fence, wall, etc.</p>\n<p>Many verbs with <em>inf</em> in <b class=\"hrv\">-jeti</b> also have a standard and a colloquial form. For example, these are standard forms:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">smrdjeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sm<u>r</u>di</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">smrdio</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">smrdjela</b>) <i>stink</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">starjeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">stari</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">stario</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">starjela</b>) <i>grow old</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">svrbjeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sv<u>r</u>bi</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">svrbio</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">svrbjela</b>) <i>itch</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">št<u>e</u>djeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">št<u>e</u>di</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">št<u>e</u>dio</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">št<u>e</u>djela</b>) <i>save</i> (money, resources)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrtjeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>r</u>ti</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">vrtio</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">vrtjela</b>) <i>spin, turn</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Instead of these forms, you’ll very frequently see – especially in casual writing and conversation, but also in some newspapers – the following simplified forms, having just <b class=\"hrv\">-i-</b>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"nopad\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sm<u>r</u>diti</b> <i>stink</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">stariti</b> <i>grow old</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sv<u>r</u>biti</b> <i>itch</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">št<u>e</u>diti</b> <i>save</i> (money, resources) <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>r</u>titi</b> <i>spin, turn</i>\n</td><td class=\"brack nopad\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad\">  </td>\n<td class=\"nopad vcent\">colloquial,<br/>quite common\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Just compare Google™ statistics for <em>past-f</em> forms on the Internet (.hr domain):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">  ...jela</b></th>\n<th class=\"last rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">  ...ila</b></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">smrd...</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\">2100</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">9700</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">star...</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\">310</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">1200</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">svrb...</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\">2800</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">2200</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">šted...</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\">11000</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">7000</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">vrt...</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\">14000</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">24000</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Bear in mind that the Internet also includes edited text (laws, newspapers) where colloquial forms are quite rare.</p>\n<p>For more information about such verbs, check A3 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"A3.html\">Verbs</a>.</p>\n<p>I will list all those verbs with both forms in the infinitive, e.g.</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrtjeti</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">vrtiti</b> <i>spin, turn</i>\n</p>\n<p>There are nouns that are used in two forms in real life, one masculine, another feminine – and the feminine form actually prevails – while Standard Croatian insists on the masculine form only. The common ones are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>Standard</th>\n<th class=\"last\">common (colloq.)</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>handle, hold</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">držak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dršk-</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">drška</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>planet</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">pl<u>a</u>n<u>e</u>t</b> (»)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">plan<u>e</u>ta</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>visit</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">posjet</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">posjeta</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Some colloquial feminine nouns are much more common, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">za dršku</b> is 14 times more frequent (on the Internet) than <b class=\"hrv\">za držak</b>.</p>\n<p>Then, Standard Croatian insists on three-way demonstrative adverbs of place and destination:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">Standard</th>\n<th>loc.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">dest.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">close</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">ovdje</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>v<u>a</u>mo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">mid</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tu</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">tamo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">distant</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">ondje</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>n<u>a</u>mo</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>However, the adverb <b class=\"hrv\">ondje</b> is quite rare in real life – you can find it mostly in books – most speakers use only two-way distinctions, while <b class=\"hrv\">tamo</b> serves two roles:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">colloq.</th>\n<th>loc.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">dest.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">close<br/>(<i>here</i>)</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">ovdje</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">tu</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>v<u>a</u>mo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">not close<br/>(<i>there</i>)</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tamo</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">tamo</b><br/>(<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>n<u>a</u>mo</b>)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For example, on the newspaper site jutarnji.hr, the adverb <b class=\"hrv\">tamo</b> is 5 times more frequent than <b class=\"hrv\">ondje</b>. On the discussion site forum.hr, it’s 27 times more frequent. The adverb <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>n<u>a</u>mo</b> is also less frequent than the others, so I’ve put it into brackets.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Standard Croatian – that is, people who write style manuals and proof text – slowly accept forms actually used. One example is the word <b class=\"hrv\">kaz<u>e</u>ta</b> <i>cassette</i>. Style manuals insisted on the form <b class=\"hrv\">ka<b class=\"hrvc\">s</b><u>e</u>ta</b> for decades – which was completely marginal in real life – but it seems the form <b class=\"hrv\">kaz<u>e</u>ta</b> has been recently finally accepted.</p>\n<p>If you buy a Croatian style manual with an idea to learn Croatian better, use it wisely: they usually list most common ‘mistakes’, so you’ll get a glimpse of how people in Croatia really speak and write. Never take any advices from such manuals for granted – recall the noun <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> <i>pain</i> above.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"example_V1\", \"Examples\")'>\n<span id=\"example_V1_ctrl\">↓ Examples (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"example_V1\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>In this billboard, there are various words for <i>vacuum cleaner</i> – they all mean the same, but some are formal, other colloqual, with the remark <b class=\"hrv\">Imamo ih sve</b> <i>We have them all</i>:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/8d0GJnv/EC-Usisivac-Sauger.jpg\" title=\"Usisivač, usisač, sauger\"/>\n<p>This sticker on a wall of a hospital in Zagreb advertises a “campaign of measuring pain”:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vvgr7p1/EC-Akcija-Mjerenja-Boli.jpg\" title=\"akcija mjerenja boli \"/>\n<p>As you can see, the word <b class=\"hrv\">bol</b> <i>pain</i> is here feminine (the ending <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> in G, the feminine form of the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">nel<s>i</s>ječen</b> <i>untreated</i>).</p>\n<p>Another example is from another hospital – this direction sign features the word <b class=\"hrv\">prijem</b> <i>reception</i>; however, many Croatian style manuals and even some dictionaries insist on the form <b class=\"hrv\">prijam</b>, which is actually rarer in use, and almost non-existant in speech:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/WtqxFvg/EC-Hitni-Prijem.jpg\" title=\"Hitni prijem\"/>\n<p>Recall also the example from 16 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"16.html\">Giving to Someone, Going to Someone</a>, where the word <b class=\"hrv\">posjeta</b> <i>visit</i> was used on a billboard in a national park, instead of the ‘proper’ <b class=\"hrv\">posjet</b>, which is much rarer in speech and writing. The phrase <b class=\"hrv\">hvala na posjeti</b> <i>thanks for the visit</i>  is very common, you can find it in cafes, restaurants, and shopping malls, like this one in Zagreb:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gF5fjnS/EC-Hvala-Na-Posjeti2.jpg\" title=\"Hvala na posjeti\"/>\n<p>In a supermarket in Zagreb, both <b class=\"hrv\">griz</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">gris</b> are available (the standard term for <i>semolina</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">pšenična krupica</b>, appears in a small print).

For instance, if you’ve just tasted a cup of tea, and you liked it, you could say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sviđa <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se <span class=\"hc-n\">čaj</span>.</b> <i>I like the tea.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If e.g. Ana feels <em>attraction or affection</em> to someone (e.g. Ivan) – and it’s not necessarily erotic, you can just like someone’s personality – one could say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b> se sviđa <span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_ani_se_svida_ivan_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana likes Ivan.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This is probably quite familiar to you if you know some German, Greek, French, Italian or Spanish, since all these languages have verbs that express <i>like</i> that behave exactly the same (and use a form that corresponds to the Croatian DL):</p>\n<table>\n<tr><td>(Spanish)</td><td><em><u>Me</u> gusta el libro.</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td>(Italian)</td><td><em><u>Mi</u> piace il libro.</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td>(French)</td><td><em>Le livre <u>me</u> plait.</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td>(German)  </td><td><em>Das Buch gefällt <u>mir</u>.</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td>(Greek)  </td><td><em><u>Μου</u> αρέσει το βιβλίο.</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td> </td><td><b class=\"hrv\">Knjiga <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se sviđa.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_knjiga_mi_se_svida_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>All six sentences above mean <i>I like the book</i>, but <em>the book</em> is the subject in all six sentences, and the person who likes (<em>I</em>, emphasized in the sentences) is <em>not</em> the subject. Therefore, all six verbs – Spanish <em>gustar</em>, Italian <em>piacere</em>, French <em>plaire</em>, German <em>gefallen</em>, Greek <em>αρέσω</em> and Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">sviđati se</b>² – are above in the 3rd person. The only real difference is the word order, which follows quite different rules in Spanish, Italian, German, Greek and Croatian (the French word order is here quite similar to the Croatian order, though).</p>\n<p>As with such sentences, in Croatian, what you’re talking about comes first: if you are talking about Ana, she comes before the verb, but Ivan (or a book) is really the topic, it can sometimes come to the first position in such sentence. (Of course, second position words are always placed in the second position.)</p>\n<p>Since what you like is the subject, and subjects are usually left out, this sentence can have multiple meanings, depending on the context:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sviđa <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_svida_mi_se_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I like it/him/her.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The same holds for Spanish (<em>me gusta</em>) and Italian (<em>mi piace</em>), since both languages usually omit subjects, if known from the context.</p>\n<p>If you like something in plural, the verb, of course, must come in plural:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sv<u>i</u>đaju <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se <span class=\"hc-n\">cipele</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_svidaju_mi_se_cipele_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I like the shoes.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sviđale su <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se <span class=\"hc-n\">cipele</span>.</b> <i>I liked the shoes.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(If you are a fan of the standard stress scheme: the verb <b class=\"hrv\">sviđati se</b>² has non-movable stress in the <em>pres-3pl</em>.)</p>\n<p>Of course, you can also say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sviđaš <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_svidas_mi_se_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>I like you.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b

f}\n</p></div>\n<p>The last sentence is in the past tense, and implies that it’s <em>no more</em>: something has changed (either ‘you’ has died, or ‘I’ doesn’t like ‘you’ anymore). </p>\n<p>You have a lot of freedom of what you can like with <b class=\"hrv\">sviđati se</b>² – it includes places and times, which simply are used as subjects:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-dl\">Ani</span> se <b class=\"hrvc\">ovdje</b> ne sviđa</b>°<b class=\"hrv\">.</b> <i>Ana doesn’t like it here.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sviđa</b>° <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-dl\">moru</span></b>.</b> <i>I like being at the seaside.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>English here usually has to use either <em>it</em> or some form of the verb <em>to be</em>, but Croatian does not (recall, there are no dummy pronouns in Croatian).</p>\n<p>Since these subjects are not nouns or pronouns, verbs are impersonal, 3rd pers. singular, and past forms must be in neuter singular:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-dl\">Ani</span> se <b class=\"hrvc\">ovdje</b> nije <b class=\"hrvc\">sviđalo</b>.</b> <i>Ana didn’t like it here.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Sviđalo</b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-dl\">moru</span></b>.</b> <i>I liked being at the seaside.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Liking places and times is also often expressed with the adverb <b class=\"hrv\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b> <em>nice</em> + DL + <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>²:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">L<s>i</s>jepo</b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je</b>°<b class=\"hrv\"> na

data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <b class=\"hrvc\">l<s>i</s>jepo</b> jučer.</b> <i>I liked it yesterday.</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>The verbs are again impersonal.</p>\n<p>You can like <em>doing something</em>: you should then put the right verb into the infinitive and place it after one of the two verbs listed above, usually <b class=\"hrv\">voljeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">voli</b>,...):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> voli <b class=\"hrvc\">trčati</b>.</b> <i>Ana loves to run.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-inf\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>The verb in infinitive can have an object, and so on:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> voli <b class=\"hrvc\">voziti</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">bic<u>i</u>kl</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_ana_voli_voziti_bicikl_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana likes to ‘drive’ bicycle.</i> (= <i>ride</i>)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-inf\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s interesting that we don’t ‘ride’ bicycles, but ‘drive’ them: <b class=\"hrv\">jahati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">jaše</b>) <em>ride</em> is reserved for horses and other animals.</p>\n<p>To express that somebody generally likes <i>running</i> (which can imply just watching others running, not running themselves), other words, so-called verbal nouns or gerunds should be used:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> voli <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">trčanje</b>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_ana_voli_trcanje_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana loves running.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can find more about verbal nouns in 66 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"66.html\">Smoking is Dangerous: Verbal Nouns</a>.</p>\n<p>This summarizes when to use each verb:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">voljeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">voli</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">volio</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">voljela</b>)</th>\n<th class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">sviđati se</b>²</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">• family members<br/>•

movie you watch <em>over and over</em>...</td>\n<td class=\"last\">• a book you’ve read once<br/>• a movie you’ve watched...</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>These verbs are <em>not</em> like English <i>love</i> and <i>like</i>. English verbs are about intensity; Croatian verbs are more about permanent or less permanent states.</p>\n<p>You can use adverbs of intensity with all such expressions, mostly <b class=\"hrv\">jako</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">stvarno</b> to strengthen expressions, using the usual placement rules for such adverbs (the intensifying adverb usually comes before the verb, but 2nd position words can intervene):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Jako</b> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se sviđa <span class=\"hc-n\">knjiga</span>.</b> <i>I like the book very much.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bilo <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <b class=\"hrvc\">jako</b> l<s>i</s>jepo na <span class=\"hc-dl\">moru</span>.</b> <i>I liked being at the seaside very much.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">stvarno</b> voli trčati.</b> <i>Ana really likes to run.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s interesting that the more formal word <b class=\"hrv\">vrlo</b> cannot be used to strengthen verbs.</p>\n<p>When <em>negated</em>, the verb <b class=\"hrv\">voljeti</b> means exactly the opposite: <i>dislike</i>. It <em>does not mean</em> ‘I don’t have an opinion’ or ‘it’s acceptable but I don’t love it’. Here <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ turns the meaning to the opposite. So, if you want to say <i>I like it, but I don’t love it</i>, you have to rephrase the sentence, for example, using the DL to express an opinion:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Knjiga</span> <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">dobra</span>, ali nije <span class=\"hc-n\">izuzetna</span>.</b>\n<i>I find the book good, but not exceptional.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p class=\"att\">Pay attention: <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ + <b class=\"hrv\">voljeti</b> = <i>dislike</i></p>\n<p>There’s another often used verb:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">zan<u>i</u>mati</b> («) <i>be interesting to</i>\n</p>\n<p>This verb is used in a similar way; however, the person who feels interest is expressed in A:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Gorana</b> z<u>a</u>n<u>i</u>ma <span class=\"hc-n\">nogomet</span>.</b>\n<i>Goran is interested in football.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>This Croatian sentence could also be translated as <i>football is interesting to Goran</i> (it’s interesting that English here kind of follows Croatian).</p>\n<p>This verb is used in a very common expression, used when you want to express that you don’t really want to hear about something (the expression is not really polite, however):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ne z<u>a</u>n<u>i</u>ma <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"1\">me</b>.</b> <i>I’m not interested.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Another verb is very similar to <b class=\"hrv\">voljeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">voli</b>,...) but stands for an even stronger feeling:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">obož<u>a</u>vati</b> («) <i>adore, be fan of, really like</i>\n</p>\n<p>It can be used for people you really love, but also for actors, sports, food, activities (including verbs in infinitive), etc.:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Igor</span> ob<u>o</u>ž<u>a</u>va <span class=\"hc-a\">kavu</span>.</b> <i>Igor ‘adores’ coffee.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-vocab\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> ob<u>o</u>ž<u>a</u>va plivati.</b> <i>Ana ‘adores’ swimming.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The verb with the meaning opposite to <i>love</i> and <i>like</i> is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">m<u>r</u>ziti</b> <i>hate</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-mrziti\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>It’s used in the same ways as <b class=\"hrv\">voljeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">voli</b>,...):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">m<u>r</u>zi</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">te</span><span class=\"hc-a\"> cipele</span>.</b>\n<a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('32_ana_mrzi_te_cipele_s')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>\n<i>Ana hates these shoes.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">m<u>r</u>zi</b> čistiti <span class=\"hc-a\">kuću</span>.</b> <i>Goran hates to clean the house.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Another verb that’s frequently used with another verb in <em>inf</em> is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">znati</b> (+ <em>inf</em>) <i>know how</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-umeti\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>This verb with a normal object in A means just <i>know</i>, but with <em>inf</em> it covers also knowledge <em>how to do</em> something:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> zna plivati.</b> <i>Ana knows how to swim.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">N<u>e</u> znamo plivati.</b> <i>We don’t know how to swim.</i> = <i>We can’t swim.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Actually, Croatian uses only <b class=\"hrv\">znati</b> in many instances where English would use <i>can</i>, i.e. <i>can read</i>, <i>can sing</i> would be always expressed with <b class=\"hrv\">znati</b> in Croatian. Colloquially, <b class=\"hrv\">znati</b> is also used for things that are done occasionally, or are known to happen occasionally, like English <i>may</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Sn<s>i</s>jeg</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">zna</b> padati i u <span class=\"hc-dl\">desetom</span><span class=\"hc-dl\"> mjesecu</span>.</b> (colloq.) <i>Snow may </i>(<i>is known to, does sometime</i>)<i> fall in October as well.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#32-months\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>(The use of <b class=\"hrv\">i</b>¨ to express <i>as well</i> will be explained later.)</p>\n<p>There’s a fine difference: while <b class=\"hrv\">moći</b> implies just a possibility, <b class=\"hrv\">znati</b> implies that something is <i>known</i> to happen (you see the connection with the verb <i>know</i>). It’s possible not in principle, but because it <em>does</em> happen. This use is a bit colloquial, but common.</p>\n<p>There are more verbs that use other verbs in infinitive, you’ll encounter them later.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"32-inf\">\n<p>® In Serbia, infinitives are much less often used: in speech, the form <b class=\"hrv\">da</b> + present prevails.

In Serbia, the same verb has the “Ekavian” form <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>meti</b>, a regular verb. So, the sentences about knowing how to swim would be like this in Serbia:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <b class=\"hrvc\"><u>u</u>me</b> da pliva.</b> <i>Ana knows how to swim.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ne <b class=\"hrvc\"><u>u</u>memo</b> da plivamo.</b> <i>We don’t know how to swim.</i> = <i>We can’t swim.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The verb is fully regular, and like “Ekavian” <b class=\"hrv\">raz<u>u</u>meti</b> <i>understand</i>, its <em>pres-3</em> is <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>meju</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ne <b class=\"hrvc\"><u>u</u>meju</b> da plivaju.</b> <i>They don’t know how to swim.</i> = <i>They can’t swim.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This verb is also used in Serbia to express that something happens occasionally, besides <b class=\"hrv\">znati</b>.</p>\n</div><!--reg-->\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"32-vocab\">In Serbia and most of Bosnia, instead of <b class=\"hrv\">nogomet</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">fudbal</b> is used. Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">jučer</b>, meaning <i>yesterday</i>, a slightly shortened <b class=\"hrv\">juče</b> is used in these countries. Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">kava</b>, the common word for <i>coffee</i> is <b class=\"hrv\">kafa</b> in Bosnia and Serbia; the variant <b class=\"hrv\">kahva</b> is also used in areas where Bosniaks live.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"32-mrziti\">In Serbia, the verb <b class=\"hrv\">m<u>r</u>ziti</b> <i>hate</i> has the unexpected “Ekavian” form <b class=\"hrv\">mrzeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">m<u>r</u>zi</b>).</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"32-months\">In Serbia and Bosnia, colloquial expressions like <b class=\"hrv\">deseti mjesec</b> <i>October</i> are not used, months are usually referred to using names.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_32\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_32_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_32\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>If we could travel back in time to the 15th century, we would find that the English verb <i>like</i> behaved then exactly like Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">sviđati se</b>².

      "html": "\n<!-- spans fixed -->\n<p>Croatian contains a big number of adjectives derived from nouns (and sometimes from other words too) that are often represented in English as nouns-used-as-adjectives. Here’s what I mean:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<i>school yard</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here <i>school</i> is actually used as an adjective, it <em>describes</em> what kind of yard it is, what it belongs to. Such adjectives are sometimes called <em>relational</em> or <em>quasi-possessive</em> adjectives. It’s interesting that such adjectives in English cannot have a comparative (you cannot say <i>more school</i>) or even cannot be used as a property (you cannot say <i>the yard is school</i>).</p>\n<p>In Croatian, you <em>cannot</em> simply use nouns as adjectives – you have to <em>turn them into adjectives</em>. It holds for some nouns in English too: you cannot use e.g. <i>person</i> as an adjective (e.g. <i>‘person space’</i>) you have to turn it into an adjective – <i>personal</i>.</p>\n<p>The main way to turn nouns into adjectives in Croatian is to append <b class=\"hrv\">-ski</b> as if it were a case ending (it’s <em>not</em> a case ending!):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">brod</b> <i>ship</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">brod<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">grad</b> <i>city</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">grad<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">more</b> <i>sea</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">mor<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">škola</b> <i>school</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">škol<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The resulting word is an adjective, so it must adapt to the noun case and gender. Since <b class=\"hrv\">dvorište</b> <i>yard</i> is neuter (as expected) we have to use it accordingly:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">školsko</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> dvorište</span>.</b> <i>This is a school yard.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bili smo u <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">školskom</b><span class=\"hc-dl\"> dvorištu</span>.</b> <i>We were at the school yard.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>In some words that add <b class=\"hrv\">-ski</b>, the <b class=\"hrv\">s</b> gets fused with neighboring consonants and vowels, and we sometimes get <b class=\"hrv\">-ški</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">-čki</b> or even <b class=\"hrv\">-ćki</b>, or other irregularities:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pošta</b> <i>post</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">pošt<b class=\"hrvc\">anski</b></b> <i>postal</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">putni<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b></b> <i>passenger</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">putni<b class=\"hrvc\">čki</b></b>\n</p>\n<p>Adjectives for cities, regions and countries are often irregular (and they are not uppercase):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bosna</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">bos<b class=\"hrvc\">anski</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">D<u>a</u>lm<u>a</u>cija</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">dalm<u>a</u><b class=\"hrvc\">t<u>i</u>nski</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Istra</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">ist<b class=\"hrvc\">arski</b></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sl<u>a</u>v<u>o</u>nija</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">slavon<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Zagreb</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">zagreb<b class=\"hrvc\">ački</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Zagorje</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">zagor<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For countries, islands and cities that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-s</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-z</b>, the final consonant is usually assimilated into <b class=\"hrv\">-ški</b>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">P<u>a</u>r<u>i</u><b class=\"hrvc\">z</b></b> (») <i>Paris</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">pari<b class=\"hrvc\">ški</b></b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-pariski\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Teksa<b class=\"hrvc\">s</b></b> <i>Texas</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">teksa<b class=\"hrvc\">ški</b></b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-pariski\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Tuni<b class=\"hrvc\">s</b></b> <i>Tunisia</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">tuni<b class=\"hrvc\">ški</b></b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-pariski\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vi<b class=\"hrvc\">s</b></b> (an island) → <b class=\"hrv\">vi<b class=\"hrvc\">ški</b></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Relational adjectives are also created for cities having more than one word (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Banja Luka</b>, a city in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and foreign ones, respelled according to pronunciation:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Banja Luka</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">banj<u>a</u>l<u>u</u>čki</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">New York</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">njujorški</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(You will also see mixed spellings, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">newyorški</b>.) You can find adjectives derived from countries in L2 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"l2.html\">Countries and Nationalities</a>, and adjectives derived from cities and towns in L3 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"l3.html\">Cities and Towns</a>.</p>\n<p>Country adjectives (many of which are used as country names) such as <b class=\"hrv\">danski</b> <i>Danish</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">irski</b> <i>Irish</i> etc. are also historically derived with the suffix <b class=\"hrv\">-ski</b>. Recall, words like <b class=\"hrv\">Hrvatska</b> <i>Croatia</i> or <b class=\"hrv\">Njemačka</b> <i>Germany</i> are <em>already</em> adjectives, just used as nouns – there’s no need to make adjectives from them.</p>\n<p>All countries and cities derive relational adjectives by <b class=\"hrv\">-ski</b> (unless they are already adjectives) – but, generally, not all words do. Many words add <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b> instead, and there’s no real rule which noun uses what ending, as you can see for adjectives derived from seasons – you have to remember it:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">jesen</b> f <i>autumn</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">jesen<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zima</b> <i>winter</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">zim<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">proljeće</b> <i>spring</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">prolje<b class=\"hrvc\">tni</b></b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-proljetni\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ljeto</b> <i>summer</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">ljet<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Common adjectives that are derived with <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b> are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">cv<s>i</s>jet</b> <i>flower</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">cvjet<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kiša</b> <i>rain</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">kiš<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kuća</b> <i>house</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">kuć<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ljubav</b> f <i>love</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">ljubav<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">osoba</b> <i>person</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">osob<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-proljetni\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">rad</b> <i>work</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">rad<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">rat</b> <i>war</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">rat<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">soba</b> <i>room</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">sob<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">stol</b> <i>table, desk</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">stol<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-stol\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">voće</b> <i>fruit</i>(<i>s</i>) →\n<b class=\"hrv\">voć<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrt</b> <i>garden</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrt<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zid</b> <i>wall</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">zid<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Observe that adjective <b class=\"hrv\">cvjetni</b> has just <b class=\"hrv\">je</b> instead of <b class=\"hrv\">ije</b>. The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">osobni</b> is frequently used in this phrase:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">osobna iskaznica</b> <i>personal identification card, ID</i>\n</p>\n<p>The phrase is often shortened (not in formal documents) to just <b class=\"hrv\">osobna</b>: the noun <b class=\"hrv\">iskaznica</b> is assumed:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">osobnu</b>.</b> <i>Your ID, please.</i> (lit. ‘<i>I’m kindly asking you the ID.</i>’)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Adr<u>e</u>sa</span> je na <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">osobnoj</b>.</b> <i>The address is on the ID.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Regardless of being used on its own, the word <b class=\"hrv\">osobna</b> behaves like any adjective — i.e. gets adjective case endings – and keeps the gender of the omitted noun (here: <em>feminine</em>).</p>\n<p>Consonants change before the ending <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b>, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">k</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">c</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> and so on, as in these examples:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bra<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b></b> <i>marriage</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">bra<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kru<b class=\"hrvc\">g</b></b> <i>circle</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">kru<b class=\"hrvc\">ž</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ml<s>i</s>je<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b>o</b> <i>milk</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">ml<s>i</s>je<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ru<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b>a</b> <i>hand</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">ru<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ni</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">no<b class=\"hrvc\">g</b>a</b> <i>leg</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">no<b class=\"hrvc\">ž</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">o<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b>o</b> <i>eye</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">o<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trbu<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b> <i>belly</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">trbu<b class=\"hrvc\">š</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">uli<b class=\"hrvc\">c</b>a</b> <i>street</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">uli<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ni</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(English <em>has</em> specific adjectives <i>personal</i>, <i>marital</i> and <i>circular</i>, but there’s no specific adjective for many other nouns in English, e.g. <i>hand</i> is simply used as an adjective in <i>hand brake</i>. English usually has specific adjectives if a noun is of French or Latin origin, since these two languages have specific adjectives). Adjectives derived from <em>cardinal directions</em> also follow this pattern:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sjeverni</b> <i>northern</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zapadni</b> <i>western</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">isto<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ni</b> <i>eastern</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ju<b class=\"hrvc\">ž</b>ni</b> <i>southern</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>A few adjectives in <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b> have specific meanings; the most common one is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">glava</b> <i>head</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">glavni</b> <i>main</i>\n</p>\n<p>It’s interesting that relational adjectives cannot be derived from days of week, except for <i>Sunday</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">nedjelja</b> <i>Sunday</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">nedjeljni</b>\n</p>\n<p>(You will occasionally see and hear adjective <b class=\"hrv\">subotnji</b> adj. <i>Saturday</i>, but it’s quite rare.)</p>\n<p>It’s very useful to learn relational adjectives derived from <em>time nouns</em> (like English <i>day</i> → <i>daily</i>, <i>month</i> → <i>monthly</i>); some of them are quite irregular:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dan</b> <i>day</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">dnev</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">noć</b> f <i>night</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">noćni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jutro</b> <i>morning</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">jut<b class=\"hrvc\">arnji</b></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">večer</b> f <i>evening</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-vecer\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">večer<b class=\"hrvc\">nji</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mjesec</b> <i>month</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">mjese<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>ni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">godina</b> <i>year</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">godi<b class=\"hrvc\">šnji</b></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For the nouns <b class=\"hrv\">tjedan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">tjedn-</b>) <i>week</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">ponoć</b> f <i>midnight</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">podne</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">podnev-</b>) <i>noon</i>, adjectives are derived regularly by adding the <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b>. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> je <span class=\"hc-n\">moj</span><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\"> mjesečni</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> prihod</span>.</b> <i>This is my monthly income.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <span class=\"hc-a\">neke</span><b class=\"hrvc hc-a\"> dnevne</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> novine</span>.</b> <i>I have a daily newspaper.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">godišnji</b> <i>annual</i> is used in a common phrase:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">godišnji odmor</b> <i>annual leave, paid vacation</i>\n</p>\n<p>The phrase is often shortened (not in formal documents) to just <b class=\"hrv\">godišnji</b>: the noun <b class=\"hrv\">odmor</b> is assumed. So, you’ll often hear (and read):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> je na <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">godišnjem</b>.</b> <i>Ivan is on (paid) vacation.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sutra <b class=\"tt\">idem<b class=\"ttb\">ići</b></b> na <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">godišnji</b>.</b> <i>I’m going on (paid) vacation tomorrow.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, even when used on its own, the word <b class=\"hrv\">godišnji</b> behaves like any adjective and keeps the gender of the omitted noun (here: <em>masculine inanimate</em>). Therefore, it got the DL ending <b class=\"hrv\">-em</b> in the first sentence (for “activity as a location”) and the A ending in the second (for “activity as a destination”).</p>\n<p>It’s also possible to derive relational adjectives from many adverbs, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">sad</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) <i>now</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">jučer</b> <i>yesterday</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">gore</b> <i>up</i> and so on: they will be explained in 76 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"76.html\">Inner and Outer and Step by Step: More on Space and Time</a>.</p>\n<p>A small number of neuter nouns which have alternative, poetic, longer plurals in <b class=\"hrv\">-<u>e</u>sa</b> always derive relational pronouns from the longer form:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">nebo</b> <i>sky</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">nebeski</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">t<s>i</s>jelo</b> <i>body</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">tjelesni</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Few nouns have relational adjectives on <b class=\"hrv\">-ji</b>, again with (specific) consonant alternations; they include most animals:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">djeca</b> coll. <i>children</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">dje<b class=\"hrvc\">čji</b></b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-djecji\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mačka</b> <i>cat</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">mač<b class=\"hrvc\">ji</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">miš</b> <i>mouse</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">miš<b class=\"hrvc\">ji</b></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ptica</b> <i>bird</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">pti<b class=\"hrvc\">čji</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">riba</b> <i>fish</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">rib<b class=\"hrvc\">lji</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zec</b> <i>rabbit</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">ze<b class=\"hrvc\">čji</b></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Mi</span> smo na <span class=\"hc-dl\">dječjem</span><span class=\"hc-dl\"> igralištu</span>.</b> <i>We’re at the </i>(<i>kid’s</i>)<i> playground.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Note that Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">igralište</b> can mean any type of <i>playing</i> or <i>sports grounds</i> (football, basketball...) so adding <b class=\"hrv\">dječji</b> makes it precise.</p>\n<p>For certain animals, it’s possible to distinguish possessive from relational adjectives; the latter includes a <em>generic</em> relation, the former possession to a <em>specific, individual animal</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"vcent nopad\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mačka</b> <i>cat</i> →  \n</td><td class=\"nopad\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mačkin</b> (possessive = specific)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mačji</b> (relational = generic)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>There are frequently used adjectives to indicate what kind of meat something is made of:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">goveđi</b> adj. <i>beef</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">janjeći</b> adj. <i>lamb</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pileći</b> adj. <i>chicken</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">teleći</b> adj. <i>beef</i> (<i>veal</i>)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Since relational adjectives cannot be simply derived from nouns, they will be listed with nouns in the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"/p/d0.html\">Core Dictionary</a>.</p>\n<p>The <b class=\"hrv\">-ski</b> is the <em>default suffix</em> for relational adjectives: new words that are adopted into Croatian use it (translation for the words below is, I hope, not necessary):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u>t<u>o</u>m</b> (») →\n<b class=\"hrv\">atom<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">laser</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">laser<b class=\"hrvc\">ski</b></b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>However, nouns ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-s</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-t</b> will likely get the suffix <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">b<u>a</u>l<u>e</u>t</b> (») →\n<b class=\"hrv\">b<u>a</u>l<u>e</u>t<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">virus</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">virus<b class=\"hrvc\">ni</b></b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>There are probably more rules on <b class=\"hrv\">-ski</b> vs <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b>, but I don’t know them at the moment.<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-rules\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a></p>\n<p>Certain terms in Croatian are not expressed in this way, especially when we describe the <em>purpose</em> of something, e.g. where something is applied or where it’s used. Then, the preposition <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ + a noun in A are put after the noun. Common examples are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">čaša <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> vino</b> <i>wine glass</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">četka <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> kosu</b> <i>hair brush</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">krema <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> ruke</b> <i>hand cream</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">lak <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> nokte</b> <i>nail polish</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pasta <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> zube</b> <i>toothpaste</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">šalica <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> čaj</b> <i>tea cup</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-salica\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Such constructions are used even in many cases when there seems to be an appropriate relational adjective. For example, <i>hand towel</i> is only <b class=\"hrv\">r<u>u</u>čn<u>i</u>k za ruke</b>, despite the relational adjective existing and being used in <b class=\"hrv\">ručna kočnica</b> <i>hand brake</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">ručni <u>a</u>l<u>a</u>t</b> <i>hand tool</i>, and some others. Also, there is an adjective <b class=\"hrv\">čajni</b>, but it’s basically used only in the expression <b class=\"hrv\">čajni kol<u>u</u>tić</b>, which is a type of tea biscuit (some 80% of appearances of <b class=\"hrv\">čajni</b> on the Internet are followed by <b class=\"hrv\">kol<u>u</u>tić</b>: try it yourself).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some of these terms have alternative versions, with relative adjectives (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">zubna pasta</b> <i>toothpaste</i>), but versions with <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ are more common in speech.</p>\n<p>Certain types of nouns, e.g. <em>gerunds</em> like <b class=\"hrv\">čitanje</b> <i>reading</i> don’t have relational adjectives at all. To express <i>reading glasses</i> in Croatian, you have to use the same construction:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"noun-fpl\">naočale</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> čitanje</b> <i>reading glasses</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-naocale\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">štap <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> pecanje</b> <i>fishing rod</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>(More about gerunds later.)</p>\n<p>The preposition <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ is used always in expressions like <i>plane to Split</i>, where you describe a vehicle:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">av<u>i</u><u>o</u>n <b class=\"hrvc\">za</b> Split</b> <i>plane to Split</i>\n</p>\n<p>However, nouns <b class=\"hrv\">put</b> <i>way, travel</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">putov<u>a</u>nje</b> <i>trip, travel</i> normally use <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨/<b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + A for destinations:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">put <b class=\"hrvc\">u</b> J<u>a</u>p<u>a</u>n</b> <i>trip to Japan</i>\n</p>\n<p>Another way of expressing relation which does not use a relational adjective is with <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + A, mostly placed after a noun, used as a predicative, or used as a kind of (secondary) object. First, it can describe basically sources of power and energy:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"gender-f\">peć</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">drva</span></b></b> <i>wood stove</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">svjetiljka <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">b<u>a</u>t<u>e</u>rije</span></b></b> <i>battery-powered lamp</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">igračka <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">nav<u>i</u>janje</span></b></b> <i>wind-up toy</i>\n</p>\n<p>Note how Croatian is more precise here. English <i>wood stove</i> is in principle ambiguous. Is it maybe a proverbial stove <i>made of wood</i>? Croatian distinguishes <b class=\"hrv\">peć od drva</b> (<i>made <u>of</u> wood</i>) from <b class=\"hrv\">peć na drva</b> (<i>running <u>on</u> wood</i>).</p>\n<p>It can be also used with the verb <b class=\"hrv\">raditi</b> <i>work, do</i> describing <em>how</em> something works:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Fen</span> radi <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">struju</span></b>.</b>\n<i>The hair dryer runs on electricity.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This preposition (with A!) is frequently used in parts of phrases that describe something;  it’s never about the material, but some other <em>distinctive</em> property. For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">krevet <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">kat</span></b></b> <i>bunk bed</i> (lit. <i>‘bed on floor/story’</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kupus <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">sal<u>a</u>tu</span></b></b>\n<i>cabbage salad</i> (lit. <i>‘cabbage on salad’</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">plaćanje <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">rate</span></b></b> <i>paying by installments</i> (lit. <i>‘on installments’</i>)<br/>\n</p>\n<p>There are four very common, fixed combinations of <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + a noun in A, with non-trivial meanings (except for one, which translates to English literally):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na primjer</b> <i>for example</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na sreću</b> <i>fortunately</i>, <i>luckily</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na vr<s>i</s>jeme</b> <i>on time</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na žalost</b> <i>unfortunately</i>\n</p>\n<p>All four are sometimes spelled as one word, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">napr<u>i</u>mjer</b> (both ways are standard)<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#33-naprimjer\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>. The phrase <b class=\"hrv\">na primjer</b> is so common that is has a standard abbreviation (the period is mandatory):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">npr.</b> = <i>e.g.</i>\n</p>\n<p class=\"att\"><em>Don’t forget</em>: when <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ is used to describe properties or power supply, it always requires the accusative case.</p>\n<!-- NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: THIS TABLE MUST BE ADAPTED WHEN TRANSLATING TO OTHER LANGUAGES -->\n<p>This table summarizes various ways to express English ‘noun attributes’ in Croatian:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first\">\nexpression\n</th><th>\nCroatian\n</th><th class=\"last\">\nexample\n</th></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\ngeneric\n</td><td>\nrel. adj. +\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrvc\">školsko</b> <b class=\"hrv\">dvorište</b> <i>school yard</i>\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\">\nx <i>of</i> y\n</td><td>\n+ G\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ključevi</b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-g\">auta</b> <i>car keys</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ključevi</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">od <span class=\"hc-g\">auta</span></b> (colloq.!)\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\nmaterial\n</td><td>\n+ <b class=\"hrv\">od</b>¨ G\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sok</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">od <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span></b> <i>apple juice</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\npurpose\n</td><td>\n+ <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ A\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">četka</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">za <span class=\"hc-a\">kosu</span></b> <i>hair brush</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\nmode, power\n</td><td>\n+ <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ A\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">peć</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">drva</span></b> <i>wood stove</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>All these constructions form phrases that can fill the first position in a sentence or clause, and then second-position words normally come after them:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-n\"><b class=\"noun-fpl\">Naočale</b></span> za <span class=\"hc-a\">čitanje</span></b>\n<b class=\"hrv\">su</b>²\n<b class=\"hrv\">na <span class=\"hc-dl\">stolu</span>.</b> <i>The reading glasses are on the table.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You will very rarely see these expressions split by second-position words, if ever.

This applies to most such nouns, but not to <b class=\"hrv\">viški</b>, which is accepted also in Serbia. Conversely, forms like <b class=\"hrv\">pariski</b> are very rare in Croatia.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"33-proljetni\">Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">proljetni</b>, a more regular “Ekavian” adjective <b class=\"hrv\">prolećni</b> is used in Serbia and as <b class=\"hrv\">proljećni</b> Montenegro, and sometimes in Bosnia; instead of <b class=\"hrv\">osoba</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">osobni</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">lice</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">lični</b> covers that meaning in Serbia and Bosnia.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"33-stol\">The noun <b class=\"hrv\">stol</b> <i>table</i> has the form <b class=\"hrv\">sto</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">stol-</b>) in Serbia and most of Bosnia, and the derived adjective is a bit unexpected <b class=\"hrv\">stoni</b>.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"33-vecer\">The noun <b class=\"hrv\">večer</b> f <i>evening</i> has the form <b class=\"hrv\">veče</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">večer-</b> f) in Serbia and most of Bosnia, but the derived adjective is the same, <b class=\"hrv\">večernji</b>.</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"33-djecji\">Adjectives ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-ji</b> (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">dječji</b>) have alternative forms ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-iji</b> (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">dječiji</b>) that actually prevail in Serbia and Bosnia and are accepted in standard there.

The <em>-i-</em> before <em>-sk-</em> was lost in Croatian, but not before it had affected the preceding consonants: for instance, it had changed <b class=\"hrv\">k</b> to <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> in <b class=\"hrv\">putnik</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">putnički</b>.</p>\n<p>Each employee in Croatia has at least 4 weeks of <b class=\"hrv\">godišnji</b>, <i>paid vacation</i>, and often more.

This is often shortened to just <b class=\"hrv\">čajna</b>, since the feminine form of the adjective is seldom used in any other expression.

      "title": "EC: Variations: Regional",
      "html": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\" id=\"post-body-2396327920532102722\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<p>Some colloquial words in Croatian – which often means very frequent in speech <em>and</em> writing – vary by region, they are known only in one region, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">šlapa</b> <i>house slipper</i>, to the point that frequently people from other regions will not be able to understand it.</p>\n<p>Most variations in vocabulary are <em>inland vs. coastal regions</em>. The following colloquial nouns are commonly used in the coastal region, while other words <em>dominate</em> the inland region (this is just a short list, there are many more):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Std./inland</th>\n<th class=\"last\">coast</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>bed sheet</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">plahta</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">l<u>a</u>nc<u>u</u>n</b> (»)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>fork</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vilica</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">p<u>i</u>r<u>u</u>n</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>pillow</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">jastuk</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">k<u>u</u>š<u>i</u>n</b> (»)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>towel</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">r<u>u</u>čn<u>i</u>k</b> (»)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">šug<u>a</u>m<u>a</u>n</b> (»)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>(If you go to villages in the inland regions, you might hear more words for the terms above, but these things I leave for later.)</p>\n<p>This is maybe the right place to look into the regions of Croatia. What are “coastal areas” in Croatia, and how many people live there? Only about 1/3 lives at the coast or near it, as this map of Croatia, where each black dot represents 10,000 people, clearly shows:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/8jnjrPj/EC-Population-Points.png\" title=\"overview of population of Croatia\" width=\"500px\"/>\n<p>(I had to distort shapes of bigger cities to fit all the dots, but it’s fairly representative; there should be 408 dots, representing the population estimate for 2018.)</p>\n<p>So, most people live inland. But, somehow, coastal areas are culturally as important as inland areas, as you’ll see in the following chapters.</p>\n<p>There are many terms which are specific for coastal regions, related to the coastal way of life, such as <b class=\"hrv\">šterna</b> <i>cistern</i>, or <b class=\"hrv\">k<u>a</u><u>i</u>ć</b>, a small wooden boat, usually propelled by oars. Such words often have no true inland equivalents.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, both regions are far from homogeneous. For example, the word for the <i>tracksuit</i> has roughly the following variation (maybe there are even more terms, and, frankly, I don’t know what is used on some islands):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">region</th>\n<th class=\"last\">form</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">inland (Zagreb area)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">tren<u>i</u>rka</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">inland (Osijek area)<br/>coast (except Split)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">trenerka</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">coast (Split)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">tuta</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>However, the main variation in many terms is still inland vs coast. Many such terms are related to home, especially food an cooking. Often, there are <em>triplets</em> – one colloquial word dominates inland, another dominates coastal areas, and there’s a standard word which is used rarely:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Standard</th>\n<th>inland</th>\n<th class=\"last\">coast</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>clothing iron</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">glačalo</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">pegla</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">šumpreš</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>screwdriver</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">odv<u>i</u>j<u>a</u>č</b> (»)</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">šrafciger</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kac<u>a</u>v<u>i</u>da</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>shoelaces</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vezice</b> f pl.</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">žniranci</b> m pl.</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">šp<u>i</u>g<u>e</u>te</b> f pl.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>small meal</i><br/><i>lunch during work</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">užina</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">ručak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ručk-</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"vcent\"><b class=\"hrv\">gablec</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">m<u>a</u>r<u>e</u>nda</b><br/>(see below)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>tomato</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">rajčica</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">par<u>a</u>d<u>a</u>jz</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pom<u>i</u>d<u>o</u>r</b> (RI)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pom</b> (ST)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pom<u>a</u>dora</b> (DU)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>bathroom sink</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">umiva<u>o</u>n<u>i</u>k</b> (»)</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">lavab<u>o</u></b> m</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">lav<u>a</u>nd<u>i</u>n</b> (»)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>So, here’s is the third term used for the <i>clothing iron</i> in Croatia. Some coastal-specific terms, such as <b class=\"hrv\">šumpreš</b>, are getting rare, at least in public, while inland (or standard) terms dominate. (Try Googling™ for <b class=\"hrv\">šumpreš</b>). However, <b class=\"hrv\">m<u>a</u>r<u>e</u>nda</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">pom<u>i</u>d<u>o</u>r</b> are very common.<p>\n<p>Some of these terms have further local variations (abbreviations above stand for RI – Rijeka, ST – Split, DU – Dubrovnik). You can also hear <b class=\"hrv\">pom<u>i</u>dora</b> and maybe even more words for <i>tomato</i>.</p>\n<p>Also, precise meanings of these words can vary: in Split, <b class=\"hrv\">m<u>a</u>r<u>e</u>nda</b> is a <i>small meal, snack</i>, while in Rijeka, <b class=\"hrv\">m<u>a</u>r<u>e</u>nda</b> also means <i>lunch</i> (i.e. a cooked meal, eaten at the lunch break at work).</p>\n<p>The noun <b class=\"hrv\">lavab<u>o</u></b> changes like any masculine noun, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">u lavab<u>o</u>u</b> <i>in bathroom sink</i> – the final vowel is never dropped, unlike in <b class=\"hrv\">auto</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">aut-</b>) m <i>car</i>.</p>\n<p>There are also triplets where all three terms are common in real life:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Standard</th>\n<th>inland</th>\n<th class=\"last\">coast</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>screw</i> (noun)</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vijak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">vijk-</b>)</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">š<u>a</u>r<u>a</u>f</b> (»)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vida</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>slice</i> (of cake, bread)</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">kriška</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">šnita</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">feta</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>faucet</i> / <i>tap</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">slavina</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">pipa</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">špina</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>You can find more about features of language colloquially used in most coastal regions in <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"i3.html\">Variations: Ikavian (dite vs dijete)</a>. (Note that colloquial use in Croatia includes also many novels, poetry and popular songs.)</p>\n<p>English has many <em>word pairs</em>, where one word is an inherited Germanic word, and another came from French or Latin (e.g. <i>freedom/liberty</i>, <i>stay/remain</i>, etc.). Croatian has similar pairs, where one word is inherited from Slavic, while another is Turkic or Greek:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"> </th>\n<th>Slavic</th>\n<th class=\"last\">Turkic/Greek</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>bed</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">postelja</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">krevet</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>well</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">zdenac</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">zdenc-</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">b<u>u</u>n<u>a</u>r</b> (»)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>kerchief</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">rubac</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">rupc-</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">marama</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Both words are used, and interestingly, often Turkic or Greek words prevail in standard use, even in actual speech, while Slavic prevail in some western regions, which were less influenced by Turks, and are found in poetry.</p>\n<p>Besides colloquial words, there are colloquial ways of expressing various things. One such thing is telling time in 12-hour manner, and in <em>quarters</em> and <em>halves</em>. It has two variants, inland and coastal:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">time</th>\n<th>inland</th>\n<th class=\"last\">coast</th>\n</tr><tr><td class=\"first\">14:00</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">14:15</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">frtalj tri</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva i kvarat</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">14:30</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pol</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">tri</b>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#v2-diff\" title=\"click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva i po</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">l</b>)\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">14:45</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tri frtalj tri</b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tri frt<u>a</u>lja tri</b><br/>\n</br></td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">tri manje kvarat</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">15:00</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tri</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">tri</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Observe that inland, number of quarters is relative the last full hour, but expressions use <em>the next hour</em>! This is a quite non-obvious way to express time. This is similar to ways in Southern Germany and Austria – and <b class=\"hrv\">frtalj</b> (») comes from German ‘<em>viertel</em>’ – meaning <em>quarter</em>. (Note this is one more rare word where stress shifts even in the ‘western’ stress scheme.) The same non-obvious was to refer to time is common in Hungarian.</p>\n<p>This is only a very shallow outline of the real language diversity in Croatia. If we would add neighboring countries (i.e. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia) we would have more variation, especially in terms related to home and cooking, names of various tools, etc. Terms in Serbia sometimes are more common with colloquial terms in inland Croatia, due to the common German influence, so <b class=\"hrv\">par<u>a</u>d<u>a</u>jz</b> is spoken in both Zagreb and Belgrade; however, there are also many terms used in Serbia which are almost unknown in Croatia. A very brief overview of such terms is given in A9 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"a9.html\">Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin</a>.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"v2-diff\">® Expressing 14:30 as <b class=\"hrv\">pola tri</b> is also very common in Serbia and Bosnia, but <b class=\"hrv\">tri frtalja tri</b> = 14:45 is unknown in these countries.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_V2\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_V2_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_V2\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>Referring to cities in Croatia with two-letter abbreviations is very common, since these two-letter combinations are used in car license plates, and everyone is familiar with them.

(This applies to English as well: 12 is <i>twelve</i> – does it end in <i>two</i> in speech?)</p>\n<p>The number <i>zero</i> also behaves as a number greater than 4 (note that English requires here plural as well!):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\">nula</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuk<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b></span>.</b> <i>I have 0 apples.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>For numbers with decimal points (in Croatian, a comma is often used instead of the decimal point) it again depends on the last word:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam dva <b class=\"hrvc\">c<s>i</s>jela</b> pet <span class=\"hc-g\">kilograma</span>.</b> <i>I have 2.5 kilos.</i> (G-<em>pl</em>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam dva <b class=\"hrvc\">c<s>i</s>jela</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">jedan kilogram</span>.</b> <i>I have 2.1 kilos.</i> (A)\n</p></div>\n<p>Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">c<s>i</s>jela</b>, words <b class=\"hrv\">točka</b> <i>dot</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">zarez</b> <i>comma</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#46-zarez\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a> are also used.</p>\n<p>Now, we can finally say <em>how old someone is</em>.

Furthermore, in speech, the word for <i>million</i> is very often <b class=\"hrv\">m<u>i</u>lj<u>o</u>n</b>, but that form is very rare in writing.</p>\n<p>The above words are <em>nouns</em> (except <b class=\"hrv\">sto</b>) and can change case according to usual roles (the counted noun is always in G-<em>pl</em>, of course):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">tisuću</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">dolara</span>.</b> <i>I have one thousand dollars.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Tisuća</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">dolara</span> je u <span class=\"hc-dl\">ladici</span>.</b> <i>One thousand dollars are in the drawer.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#46-ladica\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>The Standard Croatian noun for 1000 is <b class=\"hrv\">tisuća</b>, while the noun <b class=\"hrv\">hiljada</b> is colloquial; both words are used in speech (I personally use <b class=\"hrv\">tisuća</b>).</p>\n<p>The Croatian verb is in singular, since we’re talking about <em>a</em> thousand – only <em>one</em> thousand, like one box containing small pieces of paper.</p>\n<p>The nouns listed above – except <b class=\"hrv\">mil<u>i</u>j<u>u</u>n</b> <i>million</i> – are often used as ‘adverbs’ (identical to the <em>accusative forms</em> of nouns), regardless of their role, especially <b class=\"hrv\">tisuća</b>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"subj\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Tisuću</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">dolara</span></span> je u <span class=\"hc-dl\">ladici</span>.</b>\n<i>One thousand dollars are in the drawer.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you use the accusative form as subject (i.e. an ‘adverb’), don’t forget it then behaves as any quantity adverb, that is, adjectives and past forms of verbs must be put to neuter singular. Compare the following sentences:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"subj\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Tisuću</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">dolara</span></span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">bilo</b> u <span class=\"hc-dl\">ladici</span>.</b> (adverb) <i>One thousand dollars were in the drawer.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Tisuća</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">dolara</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">bila</b> u <span class=\"hc-dl\">ladici</span>.</b> (fem. noun, the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>While in English it’s a rule to say <i>one thousand</i> (or <i>one million</i>), in Croatian it’s a rule to use just <b class=\"hrv\">tisuća</b> (or <b class=\"hrv\">mil<u>i</u>j<u>u</u>n</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">mil<u>i</u>j<u>a</u>rda</b>) – it’s assumed there’s one if the word is in singular.</p>\n<p>If you have <em>two thousands</em> (or more) you don’t have an option to use accusative, you have to follow rules for <em>counting two things</em> (or more) – things counted are <em>thousands</em>. Therefore the word <b class=\"hrv\">tisuća</b> goes into either the 2-4 form or G-<em>pl</em>, the same as if you were counting money in <em>bags</em> or any other noun:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc hc-2\">dvije tisuće</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">dolara</span>.</b> <i>I have two thousand dollars.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\">pet <span class=\"hc-g\">tisuća</span></b> <span class=\"hc-g\">dolara</span>.</b> <i>I have five thousand dollars.</i>\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p><em>Pay attention</em> that <b class=\"hrv\">mil<u>i</u>j<u>u</u>n</b> <i>million</i> is always a noun in Croatian, following the usual rules for counted nouns (however, the forms for 2-4 and G-<em>pl</em> are normally spelled the same – length marks are seldom used):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">jedan mil<u>i</u>j<u>u</u>n</b>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dva milij<u>u</u>na</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pet milij<u>u</u>nâ</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n</div><!-- att -->\n<p>While you usually say in English <i>five million men</i>, in Croatian you <em>have</em> to adjust the word to the number before it, and a noun after the <i>million</i> always goes into G-<em>pl</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">U <span class=\"hc-dl\">Hrvatskoj</span> ž<u>i</u>vi <span class=\"subj\"><span class=\"hc-2\">četiri</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> mil<u>i</u>juna</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">ljudi</span></span>.</b> <i>Four million people live in Croatia.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p><em>Wait a second!</em> Why is the verb in singular? Shouldn’t the verb be in plural, like in:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">U <span class=\"hc-dl\">Hrvatskoj</span> ž<u>i</u>ve <span class=\"subj\"><span class=\"hc-2\">četiri</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> vrste</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">ljudi</span></span>.</b> <i>Four kinds of people live in Croatia.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Well... <em>true</em>. But the problem is that <b class=\"hrv\">mil<u>i</u>j<u>u</u>n</b> <i>million</i> is also a number, so 4 <i>million</i> seems to be often understood as a single, large number, and with numbers larger than 4, singular is used (and neuter gender, where it applies). Therefore, both singular and plural of verbs are used in such constructions, but the singular is more common. This holds for 1000 and larger numbers; here’s some statistics on the .hr domain of the Internet:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">ima</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">imaju</b>\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">dvije tisuće...</b>\n</td><td class=\"rgh\">153\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">36\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">dva milijuna...</b>\n</td><td class=\"rgh\">368\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">8\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">dvije milijarde...</b>\n</td><td class=\"rgh\">572\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">7\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>So, the singular prevails, especially for millions and larger numbers.</p>\n<p>Hundreds are expressed as:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n200 <b class=\"hrv\">dvjesto</b><br/>\n300 <b class=\"hrv\">tristo</b><br/>\n400 <b class=\"hrv\">četiristo</b><br/>\n500 <b class=\"hrv\">petsto</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n600 <b class=\"hrv\">šesto</b><br/>\n700 <b class=\"hrv\">sedamsto</b><br/>\n800 <b class=\"hrv\">osamsto</b><br/>\n900 <b class=\"hrv\">devetsto</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(There are archaic forms <b class=\"hrv\">dvjesta</b> 200 and <b class=\"hrv\">trista</b> 300 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#46-trista\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a> as well, <b class=\"hrv\">dvjesta</b> was used on banknotes.) Since they are derived from <b class=\"hrv\">sto</b>, they never change their form. You’ll occasionally see the number 600 spelled as <b class=\"hrv\">šeststo</b>. In Croatian, numbers bigger that 1000 are <em>never</em> expressed as <i>nineteen hundred</i>, always as <i>one thousand and nine hundred</i>.</p>\n<p>Ordinals derived from <b class=\"hrv\">sto</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">tisuća</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">mil<u>i</u>j<u>u</u>n</b> are a bit irregular and end in <b class=\"hrv\">-ti</b>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sto<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b> <i>hundredth</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tisuć<b class=\"hrvc\">iti</b></b> <i>thousandth</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#46-tisuca\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mil<u>i</u>j<u>u</u>n<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b> <i>millionth</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#46-tisuca\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>Thousands are, of course, used for years, as ordinal numbers; in singular, the adverb form <b class=\"hrv\">tisuću</b> is only used:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n1996. <b class=\"hrvc\">tisuću</b> <b class=\"hrv\">devetsto deved<u>e</u>set</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">i</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">šesta</b>\n</p><p>\n2015. <b class=\"hrv\">dvije tisuće</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">i</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">petnaesta</b>\n</p></div>\n<p>In speech, years are often referred to with shortened ordinals, where the word for <i>thousand</i> is left out (and often the number of hundreds, if there’s no confusion)<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#46-dvijepetnaesta\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n1996. <b class=\"hrv\">devetsto deved<u>e</u>set šesta</b> (colloq.)\n</p><p>\n1996. <b class=\"hrv\">deved<u>e</u>set šesta</b>  (colloq.)\n</p><p>\n2015. <b class=\"hrv\">dvije i petnaesta</b>  (colloq.)\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#46-dvijepetnaesta\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s one more complication left.

      "html": "\n<p>How to express <i>half an apple</i>? Or <i>third</i>? If you think you can just use ordinal numbers (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">treći</b> <i>third</i>) to express <em>parts</em> (e.h. <i>third of an apple</i>), you cannot. They must be ‘adjusted’ a bit.</p>\n<p>In English, <i>third</i> is both an adjective (<i>the third man</i>) and a noun (<i>two thirds</i>). The Croatian form <b class=\"hrv\">treći</b> corresponds to the adjective meaning only!</p>\n<p>However, it’s simple to make a noun from it: just add <b class=\"hrv\">-na</b> and you have the <em>partial noun</em> you need (except for the word for <i>half</i> does not fit to this scheme at all). For 1/2 and 1/4 there are additional words that behave like adverbs:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>noun</th>\n<th class=\"last\">adverb</th>\n</tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n1/2\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pol<u>o</u>v<u>i</u>na</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pol</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>)\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n1/3\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">treć<u>i</u>na</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n1/4\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">četv<u>r</u>t<u>i</u>na</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">četvrt</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n1/5\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pet<u>i</u>na</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\netc.\n</td><td>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<em>part</em>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dio</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jel-</b>) m\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#58-dio\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>I have listed also a generic noun meaning just <em>part</em>. How to use them? Well, just use the above nouns as any nouns on <b class=\"hrv\">-na</b>, and the other noun (one you want to express part of) goes after it, in the genitive singular:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-n\">treć<u>i</u>na</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span></b>.</b> <i>This is a third of an apple.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-a\">treć<u>i</u>nu</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span></b>.</b> <i>I have a third of an apple.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">pol<u>o</u>v<u>i</u>na</b>, adverb <b class=\"hrv\">pol</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) is much more frequent; it doesn’t change, of course, since it’s not a noun, but an adverb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ovo</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">pola</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span>.</b> <i>This is half an apple.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc\">pola</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span>.</b> <i>I have half of an apple.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Such <em>partial quantities</em> are in singular; <b class=\"hrv\">pol</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>) is neuter and other partial nouns are feminine, as expected:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"subj\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pola</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span></span> <b class=\"hrvc\">je bilo</b> na <span class=\"hc-dl\">stolu</span>.</b> <em>Half of an apple was on the table.</em>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Treć<u>i</u>na</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">je bila</b> na <span class=\"hc-dl\">stolu</span>.</b> <em>A third of an apple was on the table.</em>\n</p></div>\n<p>Just remember that you are talking about a <em>third</em> (of something) and not about <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>In Croatia, bread is usually sold in loaves and some types are cut in half if required by the customer. So you can ask at the bread counter, or in a bakery:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Molim <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"2pl\">Vas</b> pola <span class=\"hc-g\">kruha</span>.</b> lit. <i>‘A half of bread, please.’</i> (i.e. <i>a half of a loaf of bread</i>) \n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#58-kruh\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s possible to use parts with nouns in genitive plural, meaning a part of some plural quantity, possibly the total quantity; then partial quantities get verbs in plural sometimes:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"subj\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pola</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuka</span></span> <b class=\"hrvc\">je bilo <span class=\"hc-n\">zrelo</span></b>.</b>\n<i>Half of apples were ripe.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"subj\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pola</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">ljudi</span></span> <b class=\"hrvc\">su bili</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">žene</span>.</b>\n<i>Half of the people were women.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The use of plural in such sentences prevails with people and animals, while singular is common with other things (<i>apples</i>, <i>stones</i>...).</p>\n<p>The generic <b class=\"hrv\">dio</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jel-</b>) m <i>part</i> can be used with <em>both</em> singular and plural nouns (in genitive, of course):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\"><b class=\"gender-m\">dio</b></b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuke</span>.</b>\n<i>I have a part of an apple.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\"><b class=\"gender-m\">dio</b></b> <span class=\"hc-g\">jabuka</span>.</b>\n<i>I have ‘a part’ of apples.</i> (i.e. <i>a part of some set of apples</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>This is unlike English, where <i>part</i> cannot be used with plural nouns!</p>\n<p>The quantity in Croatian has always gender of the quantity-word (neuter for adverbs).

For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <span class=\"hc-a\"><b class=\"hrvc\">koju</b> jabuku</span>.</b> (A) <i>I have few apples.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <span class=\"hc-a\"><b class=\"hrvc\">neku</b> jabuku</span> negdje.</b> <i>I have an apple somewhere.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">neki</b> just expresses indefiniteness, while <b class=\"hrv\">koji</b> stands for a unknown, but likely small number of things of some kind. Here singular is used with <b class=\"hrv\">koji</b>, but the meaning is plural.</p>\n<p>Now the confusing part: the <em>adjective</em> <b class=\"hrv\">mnogi</b> is used with nouns in plural. The problem is that its neuter singular form – <b class=\"hrv\">mnogo</b> – is used as a quantity <em>adverb</em>. So both can be said:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n(1) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"subj\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Mnogo</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">ptica</span></span> l<u>e</u>ti na <span class=\"hc-a\">jug</span>.</b> <i>A lot of birds fly south.</i> (the verb is in singular!)\n</p><p>\n(2) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Mnoge</b> ptice</span> l<u>e</u>te na <span class=\"hc-a\">jug</span>.</b> (more or less the same meaning, the verb is in plural!)\n</p></div>\n<p>Observe the different verb forms: the subject of the sentence #1 behaves as neuter singular (due to the quantity adverb), while the subject of the sentence #2 is just a noun (in plural) with an adjective, as if we said <i>big birds</i> or <i>gray birds</i>. In the past tense:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n(1) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"subj\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Mnogo</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">ptica</span></span> je letjelo na <span class=\"hc-a\">jug</span>.</b> <i>A lot of birds were flying south.</i>\n</p><p>\n(2) <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Mnoge</b> ptice</span> su letjele na <span class=\"hc-a\">jug</span>.</b> (more or less the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>If there’s any difference in meaning, it’s so subtle that I don’t have any idea. However, sentences like #2 are much more common with nouns like <b class=\"hrv\">ljudi</b> pl. <i>people</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">žena</b> <i>woman/wife</i>.</p>\n<p>Of course, like other generic adjectives, <b class=\"hrv\">mnogi</b> can be also used as a pronoun:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Mnogi</b> ne vole <span class=\"hc-a\">ml<s>i</s>jeko</span>.</b> <i>Many don’t like milk.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Razgov<u>a</u>rao sam s <span class=\"hc-i\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-i\">mnogima</b></span>.</b> <i>I talked to many.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>Such use is more common than in English.

      "title": "EC: 60 Put, Give, Take, Get: More Verbs",
      "html": "\n<p>Now, let me introduce a couple of very useful verb pairs, and verbs derived from them. Each set of derived verbs makes a ‘family’. The first one is derived from the event verb pair:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">stavljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">staviti</b> <i>put, place</i>\n</p>\n<p>These verbs are simple to use – just use A for what you put, and a <em>destination</em> (unlike in English!) for where you put something:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Stavio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">pivo</span> u <span class=\"hc-a\">friž<u>i</u>d<u>e</u>r</span>.</b> (colloq.)\n<i>I’ve put the beer in the fridge.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>(I marked this as colloquial, but the Standard Croatian noun <b class=\"hrv\">hladnjak</b> is very rare in real life.) Of course, you can also specify the location of the destination, i.e. where the fridge is (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">u friž<u>i</u>d<u>e</u>r u kuhinji</b>).</p>\n<p>The verbs are derived from this pair in the same way as with the <i>stand</i> pair: the same prefix is attached to both verbs and we get a new pair with a different meaning than the original one. Two pairs we have already encountered:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u></b>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u></b>st<u>a</u>viti</b> <i>leave</i> (a thing)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">pretp<u>o</u></b>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">pretp<u>o</u></b>st<u>a</u>viti</b> <i>suppose, assume</i>\n</p>\n<p>The verb pair <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>st<u>a</u>viti</b> is frequently used with a metaphoric location <b class=\"hrv\">na miru</b> <i>in peace</i>, in meaning <i>leave alone</i>, that is, <i>not interfere</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>O</u>st<u>a</u>vila sam <b class=\"tt hc-a\">ga<b class=\"ttt\">3m/n A</b></b> <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-dl\">miru</span></b>.</b> <i>I left him alone.</i> {f}\n</p></div>\n<p>Another frequently used verb pair is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">n<u>a</u></b>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">n<u>a</u></b>st<u>a</u>viti</b> <i>keep on, continue</i>\n</p>\n<p>This pair is usually used with another verb in <em>inf</em> (it can be also used with an object in A, usually some activity). This is another <em>phase verb</em> – the verb after it should be impf., since we describe action, and not outcomes:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">N<u>a</u>st<u>a</u>vio sam č<u>i</u>tati.</b> <i>I continued reading.</i> {m}\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#60-inf\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>This can be also translated as <i>kept on reading</i> – this verb pair is the way to express that meaning in Croatian. Also, you likely noticed that the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">na</b> means <i>on</i>.</p>\n<p>This verb pair translates to several meanings in English:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">p<u>o</u></b>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">p<u>o</u></b>st<u>a</u>viti</b> <i>set</i>\n</p>\n<p>The basic meaning is <i>set</i>, in the meaning <i>fix</i>, put on an elevated place, <i>erect</i> (a monument), but also <i>make ready</i> (e.g. <i>set the table</i>). It’s not used in the meanings <i>set free</i>, <i>set in motion</i> (Croatian has specific verbs for such actions):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je p<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>vila <span class=\"hc-a\">stol</span>.</b> <i>Ana has set the table.</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#60-stol\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p></div>\n<p>When you want to express <em>where</em> something is placed or fixed, you have to use <em>destinations</em>, like for the base pair, but again unlike in English:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">P<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>vit ću <span class=\"hc-a\">sliku</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">zid</span></b>.</b> <i>I’ll put the picture on the wall.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Interestingly, this verb is also the most common verb used to formulate and ask <em>questions</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">P<u>o</u>st<u>a</u>vio sam <span class=\"hc-2\">dva</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> pitanja</span>.</b> <i>I asked two questions.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>These two verb pairs have exactly the opposite meaning:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">r<u>a</u></b>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">r<u>a</u></b>st<u>a</u>viti</b> <i>take apart, disassemble</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">s<u>a</u></b>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">s<u>a</u></b>st<u>a</u>viti</b> <i>put together, assemble</i>\n</p>\n<p>When you disassemble something, the result is expressed in <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + A (usually in plural):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> je <b class=\"hrv\">r<u>a</u>st<u>a</u>vio</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">igračku</span> na <span class=\"hc-a\">d<s>i</s>jelove</span>.</b> <i>Goran has disassembled the toy to its parts.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The following table summarizes this verb pair and common verbs from its ‘family’:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">stavljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">staviti</b></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">prefix</th>\n<th>used with</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>none</em></td>\n<td>A (+ dest)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>put, place</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>-</b></td>\n<td>A (+ dest)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>set, place, erect</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>leave</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>A <b class=\"hrv\">na miru</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>leave alone</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">n<u>a</u>-</b></td>\n<td>A / <em>inf</em></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>continue</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pretp<u>o</u>-</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">da</b> + clause</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>suppose that</i>...</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">r<u>a</u>-</b></td>\n<td>A (<b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ A)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>take apart</i> (<i>to</i>...)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">s<u>a</u>-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>put together</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>There are more verb pairs derived from this base pair; these were just the most common ones. All the pairs we have seen are simply derived from the base pair, by prefixes. This pattern of derivation can be called <em>symmetric</em>. The other three verb ‘families’ in this chapter are symmetric too. The first one is derived from:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">daje</b>) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">dati</b> <i>give</i>\n</p>\n<p>The verb pair is simply used with two objects, one in A (what is given) another in DL (who got it):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je dala <span class=\"hc-dl\">Goranu</span> <span class=\"hc-a\">čokol<u>a</u>du</span>.</b> <i>Ana has given Goran a chocolate.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This pair is used first in literal meaning of ‘give’, not when e.g. ‘<i>giving a lecture</i>’. However, it has more uses than this basic one (it could be argued that <b class=\"hrv\">dati</b> behaves as a ‘modal’ verb in some circumstances). They will be explained gradually.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting that the perf. verb <b class=\"hrv\">dati</b> is often used in the present tense, especially when negated, to indicate <em>intentions</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">N<u>e</u> <b class=\"hrvc\">dam</b> <b class=\"tt hc-dl\">ti<b class=\"ttt\">2 DL</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">loptu</span>.</b> <i>I don’t want to give you the ball.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The perf. verb is short (its <em>pres-3</em> is only one syllable) so it’s one of few verbs where stress shifts to the negative particle <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>¨ even in the ‘western’ stress scheme. This is the cause of quite frequent (but non-standard) spellings like <b class=\"hrv\">nedamo</b> <i>we don’t want to give</i> and like.</p>\n<p>This verb pair is also used in an interesting phrase:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">daje</b>) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">dati</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">sve od sebe</b> <i>do his/her/their best</i>\n</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Dali smo <b class=\"hrvc\">sve od sebe</b>.</b> <i>We did our best.</i> {m/mixed}\n</p></div>\n<p>All verbs derived from this pair follow the same pattern, e.g.:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">do</b>d<u>a</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">d<u>o</u></b>daje</b> / <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">d<u>o</u></b>d<u>a</u>je</b>) ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">d<u>o</u></b>dati</b>\n</p>\n<p>I’ll show you three common derived verb pairs. Each of them behaves like the base pair: there are two objects, one in A, another, optional, in DL.</p>\n<p>With the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">do-</b>, the meaning is <i>add</i>, but also <i>pass</i> (e.g. salt or ball in a game):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> je dodao <span class=\"hc-a\">loptu</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">Marku</span>.</b> <i>Ivan passed the ball to Marko.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This verb can be used for mathematical addition, but there’s another verb pair with the specifically mathematical meaning:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">zbrajati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">zbrojiti</b> <i>add</i> (in math)\n</p>\n<p>With the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b>, the meaning is <i>sell</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Darko</span> je prodao <b class=\"tt hc-a\">auto<b class=\"ttt\">masc.</b></b> <span class=\"hc-dl\">Ani</span>.</b> <i>Darko sold the car to Ana.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> <b class=\"tt\">pr<u>o</u>daje<b class=\"ttb\">prod<u>a</u>vati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">jabuke</span>.</b> <i>Ivan sells apples.</i><br/>\n</p></div>\n<p>The third common verb pair is derived with <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b>, with the meaning <i>hand over</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Poštar</span> je predao <span class=\"hc-a\">pismo</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">Ani</span>.</b> <i>The postman handed the letter over to Ana.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The impf. verb from this pair is also used in meaning <i>give lectures</i>, (for more information, check 73 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"73.html\">Teach, Borrow, Succeed: Two-Sided Verbs</a>):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> <b class=\"tt\">pr<u>e</u>daje<b class=\"ttb\">pred<u>a</u>vati</b></b> <span class=\"hc-a\">matem<u>a</u>tiku</span>.</b> <i>Ivan teaches math.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>All three pairs have also alternative forms of present tense of the impf. verb, which are regularized, i.e. <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>o</u>d<u>a</u>vam</b>, etc. They are much less common that the standard forms. This table summarizes common verbs from this ‘family’:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">daje</b>) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">dati</b></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">prefix</th>\n<th>used with</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">(none)</td>\n<td>A (DL)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>give</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">do-</b></td>\n<td>A (DL)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>add</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b></td>\n<td>A (DL)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>hand over</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b></td>\n<td>A (DL)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>sell</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>There are more common verbs derived from this pair. One of them is derived with <b class=\"hrv\">u-</b>. It behaves differently than the pairs above, and has a bit unexpected meaning: <i>marry</i>. Moreover, its use is rather specific; for more details, check 89 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"89.html\">Customs and Traditions</a>.</p>\n<p>This pair has the opposite meaning to the previous one:<p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>z<u>i</u>mati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">uzeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">uzme</b>) <i>take</i>\n</p>\n<p>Now, a warning. The English verb <i>take</i> has many uses, many of them having nothing to do with <em>literally</em> taking things; e.g. to <i>take a shower</i> doesn’t really mean to go to the bathroom, unscrew the shower, and take it with you! The Croatian verbs <em>are</em> used in some ways when English <i>take</i> is used, such as:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<i>take the key</i><br/><i>take a pill</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>take a taxi</i><br/><i>take a vacation</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uzeo sam <span class=\"hc-a\">jaknu</span>.</b> <i>I took the jacket.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uzet ćemo <b class=\"tt hc-a\">taksi<b class=\"ttt\">masc.</b></b>.</b> <i>We’ll take a taxi.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>To express <em>who</em> you take something from, use <b class=\"hrv\">od</b>¨ + G:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uzeo sam <b class=\"hc-a\">jaknu</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">od <span class=\"hc-g\">Ivana</span></b>.</b>\n<i>I took the jacket from Ivan.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>To express <em>where</em> you took something from, use <em>origins</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uzeo sam <b class=\"hc-a\">jaknu</b> iz <span class=\"hc-g\">orm<u>a</u>ra</span>.</b>\n<i>I took the jacket from the wardrobe.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>In many common situations where <i>take</i> is used in English, Croatian uses other verbs and verb pairs:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">English <i>take</i></th>\n<th class=\"last\">Croatian verb(s)</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>I took a walk</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">šetati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">šeta</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">šeće</b>) ~* <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> («) <i>walk, stroll</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>I took a shower</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">tuš<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² ~* <b class=\"hrv\">o-</b> <i>shower</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>They take credit cards</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">primati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">primiti</b> <i>receive</i> (also <i>accept</i>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>I took kids to the park</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">voditi</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">odvesti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">odv<u>e</u>de</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">odveo</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">odvela</b>) <i>lead</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>I took it seriously</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">shvaćati</b> ~~ <b class=\"hrv\">shvatiti</b> <i>understand</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>It took a lot of time</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">trebati</b> <i>need</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>We took the first place</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">osv<u>a</u>jati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">osv<u>o</u>jiti</b> («) <i>conquer</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p class=\"att\">If you speak only English, <em>pay attention</em> to use specific Croatian verbs when you would use e.g. <i>take a shower</i> in English.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of derived verbs from this pair; they all follow the same pattern, one of them is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pre<u>u</u>z<u>i</u>mati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>e</u><u>u</u>zeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>e</u><u>u</u>zme</b>) <i>take over</i>\n</p>\n<p>Another common pair is derived with <b class=\"hrv\">od-</b>; it means <i>substract</i>, but also <i>take by force</i>.</p>\n<p>Another derived verb has <b class=\"hrv\">pod-</b> and a bit unexpected meaning – <i>undertake</i>.

      "html": "\n<p>UNDER CONSTRUCTION, coming soon...</p>\n<p>Here's a longer example: a part of a novel.</p>\n<p>When in 2019, a student of achitecture from <b class=\"hrv\">Os<s>i</s>jek</b> published a novel with the title <b class=\"hrv\">N<u>a</u>d<u>o</u>hvat</b> <i>Within Reach</i>, very few paid any attention. </p>\n<p>After a while, a couple of reviews appeared; most were astonished that an unknown 22-year-old student, who never published anything before, wrote a book spanning decades of complex history with dozens of characters speaking various dialects, over more than 450 well-written pages. More and more people noticed the book -- and realized its a major work of Croatian literature.</p>\n<p>The author was <b class=\"hrv\">Ena Katar<u>i</u>na Haler</b>. She later explained she had started working on it back in high school. While studying architecture, she worked on designs and drawings in the day, and then worked on the novel into the night, combining her family history, fiction and official documents.</p>\n<p>The novel got the Croatian book of the year award: <b class=\"hrv\">Haler</b> was the youngest recipient ever. Since then, she has started writing articles for magazines and published another novel in 2024 -- which again received very positive reviews -- while working as architect at the same time. (I have to admit: I had some bad dreams after reading her second novel. It's a bit too dark for me.)</p>\n<p>This is a short except from her acclaimed 'big work', published with her kind permission.

Clicking on (...) after some lines will display additional details of grammar and culture, and clicking again will hide them.

Danas su svi tu u dućanu, to kažu.“\n  \n„A jel? Ko to?“\n„A sad... Miran i Vaso od Stanka, njih znaš, onaj Peđa, Aco...\njoš neki kojima nisam zapamtila ime.

Bože, Kate!“\nNasmijavalo me to.\nHodale smo niz glavnu cestu, a kako bi nas koja žena navaljena\nna prozor vidjela da prolazimo njišući spojene dlanove, viknula bi:\n„Vide lijepih cura!“ pa bismo se cerekale, kao neugodno nam je, a\nona dodaje za nama kada već prođemo i susjednu kuću: „Pozdravite mater!“ \ni tako sve dok naposljetku ne stignemo i do naše kuće.\nUlazim u kuću provlačeći se između braće i oca, zbijeni stoje na\nulazu i navlače na sebe radne jakne, udara me keper po licu dok\nmlate rukama kao da me nema. Julijana lupa uza stube, trči se\npresvući, ja uzimam tanjure, naslanjam ih na prsa i nosim do stola na kojem se puši mlijeko.\n„Na, dršte“, mama pruža zamotuljke doručka tati, Nikoli i Josipu. „Će bit dost, a?“ popravlja ovratnik tati kao da se sprema na\nkakvo slavlje.\n„Joso, ti si sa mnom danas“, samo je spremio hranu u torbu i\nnastavio, „u Domu smo, radimo popise.“\n„Jel, kud ja?“\n„Treba tako, kud! Niko, možeš skupit Stipana i Tomu usput,\nideš s njima.“\n„Ajde de, šta Tomu već vode radit?“\n„Je već! Završio školu umalo, vrijeme je valaj. Oni njegov brat\nništa, moraju njega. Al nije ni on neka sreća.“\n„A da?“ mama je i dalje stajala pred njim.\nNapokon je pogleda: „Ma ništa, Marice, ništa. Nesposobno\nto, gore neg da su mazgu izrodili!“\n„Ej, đe ćeš tako, aj!“ okrzne ga dlanom kao da opominje.\n„Jes valaj, a šta bi da kažem? Eno i nekidan, pijanog ga iz jarka\nvodili. Lego tamo, ni daleko sveti Križ, neđe upo noći.“\n„Šta lego, ispružio se sav, a glavu u blato zaronio!“ smijao se Josip. „Ja ga nosio, na svoje oči vidio!“\n„Ma!“ odmahnula je rukom.\n„Ti nikad nećeš da čuješ o njemu, a šta da ti kažem, eto nek ti\nkaže sin.“\n„Nas trojica, a on jedan. I jedva! Vukli se do kuće, sve oće stat\npa padne. Ludo i pijano, natego bocu ko da mu je sto godina i dosta živit, eto.“\n„Mater mu je fina, nemam šta reć.“\nTata je podvrtao hlače i govorio: „Fina je, a ćaća isti taki, niškoristi. Bože pomozi.“\n„Ni čudo da strikan vodi Tomu sa sobom“, nastavio je Josip,\n„da ga odvuče od tog malo.“\n„Šta će, joj“, mama je odmahivala glavom, „kad je sam čovjek,\nnema svoje djece, jadno i to.“\n„Tomi će ostat udio zadruge od Stipana, ako se ne ubije dotad. Ajmo!“\n„Đe bi se ubijao, šuti, nemoj! Aj, Katarina, sjedi, uzimaj jest.\nĐe ti je sestra?“\n„Ne znam.“\n„Zovi je. Dobro me sjeti, moram im se javit, Tominima.“ Rezala je kruh i skupljala mrvice na hrpu.\n„Šta bi im se javljala?“ tata otrgne komad crnog kruha i umoči u mlijeko.\n„Kako šta, red je. Nismo dugo.“\nŽvakao je i govorio, brišući mrvice s jakne i brade. „Nismo\njer su taki. Pijanice. Džabe ti familije bez jednog dobrog djeteta.“\n„Vide ga!“\n„Mani to, Marice, aj!“\n„Red je...“\n„Đe ti više vidiš red ovdje?“ podigao je glas.\n„Šta ti je, Ivo, nemoj sad!“\n„Đe si bila to ranom zorom?“ okrenuo se prema Julijani čim se spustila.\n„Na polju kod izvora. Išla sam se malo družit.“\n„Ništa ne kažem.“ Još jednom je obrisao bradu. „I, ko je sve bio, Julo?“\n„Ko bi bio! Juraj od Ranka, Marko, Franka, Jana... Miran i Vaso.“\n„Jel Stankovi?!“ izvio mu se glas u piskutavi smijeh.\nJulijana je bila zbunjena. „Ja ne znam, tajo, čije druge vi\nznadete!“\n„Nasula sam ti mlijeko da se ladi“, pokazala sam Julijani.\n„Ničije, već baš njegove“, nastavio je tata. „Jesi vidila i Stanka,\njel on bio tamo?“\n„Mislim da njemu nije rada da se igra s nama, tata.“\n„Julijana, znaš šta te pitam!“ povisio je glas, a onda nastavio\ntiše. „Je li dolazio šta po njih, a?“\nOdmahnula je glavom, prekriživši ruke na prsima. „Nit dolazi on, nit su mu djeca raspoložena za igru. Zadirkuju, ne daju se,\n  mani to, bolje nama kad njih nema u selu.“</p>\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=7615867549788897473&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=7615867549788897473&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=7615867549788897473&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=7615867549788897473&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=7615867549788897473&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</p></p></div>"

      "html": "\n<p>This song might be a bit over the top for you, but it should be understood in its context. It was first performed in <b class=\"hrv\">Split</b>, the largest city in Dalmatia (and the second largest in Croatia) a year after <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_War_of_Independence\">the 1991-95 war</a>; in the war, Dalmatia was almost cut off from the rest of Croatia (the only road led over the damaged <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pag_Bridge\"><b class=\"hrv\">Pag</b> bridge</a> and a ferry line connecting the island of <b class=\"hrv\">Pag</b> to the mainland; both were occasionally closed.) Tourism, the main source of income in Dalmatia for many, was reduced to zero. Power outages were common. Recovery was slow (some parts of Croatia basically never recovered).</p>\n<p>Also, there’s a long tradition of local pride in Dalmatia, the most southern historical province of Croatia, likely much more known in the world than Croatia – Dalmatia is actually mentioned in the Bible – despite it having less than a million inhabitants. Much before this song, there were other songs which could be possible anthems for Dalmatia. Dalmatia has had a specific culture for centuries, strong cultural ties to Venice (it was ruled as a Venetian colony for 4 centuries) and later to generally Italy – the city of <b class=\"hrv\">Zadar</b> had especially strong ties – explaining why this song sounds like from an Italian opera.</p>\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">Grdović</b> continued to write similar songs, such as <b class=\"hrv\">Dalmat<u>i</u>nac</b> <i>Dalmatian</i>, with chorus <i>I’m Dalmatian / This is my home</i> before his songs became quite trivial, and he started to be more known for arrests, car crashes and other incidents under the influence of a lot of alcohol.</p>\n<p>Dalmatia is more traditional and much more Catholic (as you can see in this song) than the superficially similar parts of the Northern Croatian Adriatic (i.e. the <b class=\"hrv\">R<s>i</s>jeka</b> area and Istria). There are striking cultural differences between these two parts of the Croatian coast – for example, a song about Istria including a Christian prayer is virtually unthinkable. The most popular singer from <b class=\"hrv\">R<s>i</s>jeka</b> is <b class=\"hrv\">Damir Urban</b>, a shaved-head rocker who often performs barefoot and <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://www.muzika.hr/izvjestaji/urban-nije-mala-truba/\">in black dresses</a>; compare it to <b class=\"hrv\">Grdović</b>’s sound and look. More differences will be explained in later chapters.</p>\n<p>There’s one more interesting detail: <b class=\"hrv\">Grdović</b>, his relative <b class=\"hrv\">Matešić</b>, very successful <b class=\"hrv\">Tomislav Ivčić</b>, his half-brother <b class=\"hrv\">Đani Maršan</b> and an unusual number of various singers come from a neigborhood of <b class=\"hrv\">Zadar</b> called <b class=\"hrv\">Arbanasi</b>. The word <b class=\"hrv\">Arbanas</b> is an archaic word for <i>Albanian</i>: that neighborhood is a former village where people from the area between the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Skadar\">Lake Skadar</a> and the sea were settled in the early 18th century. Most settlers spoke <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language\">Albanian</a>; even today, some older people in <b class=\"hrv\">Arbanasi</b> speak a particular Albanian dialect (with a lot of Croatian, <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_language\">Venetian</a> and Italian words, of course), although most have assimilated long ago (all of them consider themselves Croats).</p>\n</div><!-- EXAMPLE ENDS -->\n<!--##QUIZ##-->\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Answ_72()\n{ var

      "title": "EC: 73 Teach, Borrow, Succeed: Two-Sided Verbs",
      "html": "\n<!-- spans fixed -->\n<p>There are couple of verbs in Croatian that show a bit bizarre behavior (such behavior is not limited to Croatian and even to related Slavic languages, though).</p>\n<p>First, there are verbs that can have <em>two</em> distinct objects in A at the same time. Common verbs and verb pairs with that feature are:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pitati</b> ~ (<b class=\"hrv\">u-</b>) («) <i>ask</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>čiti</b> ~* <b class=\"hrv\">na-</b> («) <i>learn, teach</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>The perf. verb <b class=\"hrv\">up<u>i</u>tati</b> («) <i>ask</i> is rarely used.</p>\n<p>In all such verbs, two objects are clearly distinguished: one object is a person (or animal) and another is not. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> je pitao <b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-a\">nešto</span> <span class=\"hc-a\">Anu</span></b>.</b> <i>Goran asked Ana something.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>In this sentence, both <b class=\"hrv\">Ana</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">nešto</b> <i>something</i> are in A, i.e. <em>objects</em>, but one object is ‘who’, and another ‘what’, so there’s no ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Another example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je <u>u</u>čila <b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-a\">Gorana</span> plivati</b>.</b> <i>Ana taught Goran to swim.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here, instead of the second object (‘what’), we have a verb in <em>inf</em>, so it’s clear what is taught.</p>\n<p>Now, you’re probably scratching your head: doesn’t <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>čiti</b> mean <i>learn, study</i>? Yes, it does. It has both meanings.</p>\n<p>When the verb pair <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>čiti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">na-</b> («) is used with a single object in A, which is a thing (‘what’), it means <i>learn, study</i>. However, when its object is a person (or animal), then it means <i>teach</i>, and then another object in A (‘what’) can be used to express <em>what</em> is taught. (The second object is not mandatory). The ‘what’ object in both \"configurations\" can be a verb in <em>inf</em>. Compare:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> <u>u</u>či <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">Gorana</b> plivati.</b> <i>Ana is <u>teaching</u> Goran to swim.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> <u>u</u>či plivati.</b> <i>Goran is <u>learning</u> to swim.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Therefore, whenever this verb pair gets an object that’s a person (or animal), its meaning shifts!</p>\n<p>But what if someone is a teacher, and we want to say e.g. <i>Ivan teaches math</i>? One solution is to express a person-object with some generic word, to shift the verb meaning. For instance, you can hear:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> <u>u</u>či <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">djecu</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">matem<u>a</u>tiku</span>.</b> <i>Ivan teaches math <u>to children</u>.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Beware, here the Croatian noun <b class=\"hrv\">djecu</b> is in A, while English has <i>to</i>, often corresponding to the Croatian DL case.)</p>\n<p>We cannot say just <b class=\"hrv\">Ivan <u>u</u>či matem<u>a</u>tiku</b>, since it has exactly the opposite meaning, however, we can in principle say (but this sounds quite incomplete to me):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> <u>u</u>či <span class=\"hc-a\">djecu</span>.</b> <i>Ivan teaches children.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Another way is to use a more formal verb pair:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pred<u>a</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>e</u>daje</b>) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>e</u>dati</b> <i>teach, give lecture</i>\n</p>\n<p>So we can say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> pr<u>e</u>daje <span class=\"hc-a\">matem<u>a</u>tiku</span>.</b> <i>Ivan teaches math.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are more verbs that have two opposite meanings, depending on other words around them. Common ones are:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">iznajmlj<b class=\"suff\"><u>i</u>vati</b></b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-uje</b> «) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">izn<u>a</u>jmiti</b> («) <i>rent</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">posuđ<b class=\"suff\"><u>i</u>vati</b></b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-uje</b> «) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pos<u>u</u>diti</b> («) <i>borrow/lend</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#73-borrow\" title=\"click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Both verb pairs have two meanings, depending on the cases used. What is rented/borrowed/lent is always in A. If you add a person (or animal, but also an institution, and so on) in DL, it denotes someone receiving:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pos<u>u</u>dio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">kišobran</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">Ani</b>.</b> <i>I’ve lent the umbrella to Ana.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Izn<u>a</u>jmili smo <b class=\"ft-dl hrvc\" data-tip=\"3pl\">im</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">kuću</span>.</b> <i>We’ve rented (out) the house to them.</i> {m/mixed}\n</p></div>\n<p>However, if you instead of DL use <b class=\"hrv\">od</b>¨ + G, the meaning shifts, and G represents the source (i.e. the owner):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> je pos<u>u</u>dila <span class=\"hc-a\">kišobran</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">od <span class=\"hc-g\">mene</span></b>.</b> <i>Ana borrowed the umbrella from me.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Izn<u>a</u>jmili su <span class=\"hc-a\">kuću</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">od <b class=\"hc-g\">nas</b></b>.</b> <i>They’ve rented the house from us.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s interesting that English <i>rent</i> shows the same double meaning. If you use the verbs without DL or <b class=\"hrv\">od</b>¨ + G, the meaning is ambiguous, and depends on the context.</p>\n<p>(Standard Croatian insists on using another verb pair in the formal Croatian – <b class=\"hrv\">unajmlj</b><b class=\"hrv suff\"><u>i</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-uje</b> «) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">un<u>a</u>jmiti</b> («) – for the meaning <i>rent something from someone</i>, but it’s less common in real life.)</p>\n<p>The Croatian verb pairs for <i>rent</i> and <i>borrow/lend</i> are ‘round-trip’ verbs, that is, they imply that the state of things will be restored after some time. Therefore, they are used with ‘round-trip periods’, that is, preposition <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + A:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Izn<u>a</u>jmili smo <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"3pl\">im</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">kuću</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-2\">dva</span><span class=\"hc-2\"> tjedna</span></b>.</b> <i>We’ve rented (out) the house to them <u>for two weeks</u>.</i> {m/mixed}\n</p></div>\n<p>Unlike the verbs above, which shift their meaning according to cases used, there are some verbs (or verb pairs) that use cases in two distinct ways – but there’s not much difference in meaning. The first one is the main way to express <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em> in Croatian:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">usp<s>i</s>j<u>e</u>vati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">uspjeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">uspije</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">uspio</b>) <i>succeed</i>\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#73-uspjeti\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p>\n<p>The impf. verb has the Standard stress shift to the 1st syllable (<b class=\"hrv\">-ije-</b> is usually one syllable when inside a word), but the perf. verb is pronounced as three syllables in the present tense: <b class=\"hrv\">us-pi-je</b>, like <b class=\"hrv\">piti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pije</b>) <em>drink</em>.</p>\n<p>Unlike English, this verb takes a verb in <em>inf</em> – or an infinitive clause, i.e. an <em>inf</em> with an object and possibly other words attached – as its object. It can be translated with English <i>succeed</i> or <i>manage</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uspjeli smo r<s>i</s>ješiti <span class=\"hc-a\">pr<u>o</u>bl<u>e</u>m</span>.</b>\n<i>We succeeded in solving the problem.</i> {m/mixed}\n<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#73-inf\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uspjela je otv<u>o</u>riti <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span>.</b>\n<i>She managed to open the window.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Nisam uspio proč<u>i</u>tati <span class=\"hc-a\">knjigu</span>.</b>\n<i>I failed to read the book.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>This verb is not used to <i>‘manage household’</i> and similar things – only to manage <i>to do</i> something.</p>\n<p>Like <b class=\"hrv\">trebati</b> <i>need/should</i>, this verb pair can be – and often is – used in the ‘reverse’ mode: what is achieved (or not) is the subject (in N), and the person (or animal) who was responsible is optionally expressed in DL. As usual, if the subject is a verb in <em>inf</em>, it behaves like neuter singular, 3rd person:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uspjelo <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1pl\">nam</b> je <span class=\"subj\">r<s>i</s>ješiti <span class=\"hc-a\">pr<u>o</u>bl<u>e</u>m</span></span>.</b>\n<i>We succeeded in solving the problem.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uspjelo <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"3f\">joj</b> je <span class=\"subj\">otv<u>o</u>riti <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span></span>.</b>\n<i>She managed to open the window.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Nije <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> uspjelo <span class=\"subj\">proč<u>i</u>tati <span class=\"hc-a\">knjigu</span></span>.</b>\n<i>I failed to read the book.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Note that <b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>bl<u>e</u>m</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">prozor</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">knjiga</b> are <em>not</em> the subjects: the subjects are now the verbs in <em>inf</em>: <b class=\"hrv\">r<s>i</s>ješiti</b> and so on.</p>\n<!-- DIFFERENT IN THE PDF!!!!! --->\n<p>As in other examples when infinitives (with their objects) are actually subjects, they will be highlighted with a <span class=\"subj-c\">blue frame</span> if you place your mouse over an example, or touch it (on touchscreens). Try the examples above!</p>\n<p>In this mode, the verb pair is more versatile: the subject can be also a noun: something that you <i>succeeded in making</i> (or <i>failed to make</i>). Now you must observe the gender of subject in the past tense:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">K<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č</span> je uspio.</b>\n<i>The cake turned out fine.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uspio <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1pl\">nam</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">k<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>č</span>.</b>\n<i>We succeeded in making the cake.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Other common verbs that can be used in two ways are:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">čuditi</b> <i>wonder, be surprised, marvel</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">r<u>a</u>d<u>o</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">raduje</b>) <i>look forward to</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ves<u>e</u>liti</b> (very similar meaning)\n</p>\n<p>They are usually used in a way that what causes emotions is in DL, the person affected is the subject (in N), and a <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² must be used:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Radujem se <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">odmoru</b>.</b> <i>I’m looking forward to the vacation.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>But these verbs can be used in the ‘inverse’ as well, where the person affected is in A, and what causes emotion is the subject (there’s no <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² now):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Raduje <b class=\"ft-a hrvc\" data-tip=\"1\">me</b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">odmor</b>.</b> (the same meaning, less frequent)\n</p></div>\n<p>This way of using the verb <b class=\"hrv\">čuditi</b> is often considered non-standard in Croatian; however, it’s very common, especially when the subject – <em>what makes you wonder</em> – is a content clause:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čudi <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"1\">me</b></b>\n<span class=\"subj\">[<b class=\"hrv\">da <b class=\"ft-g\" data-tip=\"3f\">je</b> nema</b>°]</span><b class=\"hrv\">.</b>\n<i>I am surprised</i> [<i>she’s not here</i>].\n</p></div>\n<p>Check the Google™ results on the .hr domain, in thousands:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">\"čudi me da\"</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">47</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">\"čudim se da\"</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">29</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>When translated to English, <b class=\"hrv\">čuditi</b> corresponds to several English verbs:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">čuditi se</b>² (+ DL) <i>wonder, marvel</i> (<i>at</i> DL)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čuditi</b> (+ A) <i>amaze, surprise</i>\n</p>\n<p>The following verbs can be used in several ways, with different cases:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stiti</b> <i>use</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">oduševlj<u>a</u>vati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">oduš<u>e</u>viti</b> («) <i>be/get enthusiastic</i>\n</p>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stiti</b> can be used in three ways, and two of them have the same meaning:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stiti</b> + A (very common, but non-standard)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stiti se</b>² + I (much less common, but standard)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stiti</b>² + DL (less common)\n</p>\n<p>Using this verb simply with A is being gradually accepted as standard (i.e. what teachers in schools consider ‘correct’):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">K<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stim <span class=\"hc-a\">Firefox</span>.</b> <i>I use Firefox.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">K<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stim se <span class=\"hc-i\">Firefoxom</span>.</b> (the same meaning – standard, but very rare in real life)\n</p></div>\n<p>(As an excersize, enter first <b class=\"hrv\">\"koristim Firefox\"</b> and then <b class=\"hrv\">\"koristim se Firefoxom\"</b> into Google™.)</p>\n<p>When used with DL, what is useful is the subject, while the person who benefits is in DL (but this is less common):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">K<u>o</u>r<u>i</u>stio <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je <span class=\"hc-n\">tvoj</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> savjet</span>.</b>\n<i>Your advice was helpful to me.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>The other verb pair is used two ways, and the A-N way is much more common than N-<b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²-I:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Film</span> <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"1\">me</b> je oduš<u>e</u>vio.</b> <i>The movie amazed me.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Oduš<u>e</u>vio sam se <span class=\"hc-i\">filmom</span>.</b> {m} (the same meaning, much rarer)\n</p></div>\n<p>However, the second use of cases with this pair is common without an object in I, in meaning <i>be/become entusiastic</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Oduš<u>e</u>vila se.</b> <i>She got enthusiastic.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are other verbs who use cases in this way, some will be introduced later.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are two common verbs where the affected person is in either DL or (non-standard) in A.

      "html": "\n<!-- spans fixed -->\n<p>Croatian has an interesting way of expressing that something happened, you were involved, but you <em>weren’t</em> in control, it just happened – <i>to you</i>.</p>\n<p>As you can probably guess, it involves the DL case, which usually corresponds to English <i>to</i> + person / personal pronoun:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">To</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se dog<u>o</u>dilo.</b> <i>It happened <u>to me</u>.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s kind of similar to expressions like <b class=\"hrv\">hladno mi je</b>, but now subjective feelings are not important. Consider the following sentence:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Čaša</span> je pala.</b> <i>The glass fell.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>We don’t know why it happened. Just adding a person in DL changes its meaning subtly:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Čaša</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je pala.</b> <i>I dropped the glass (accidentally).</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you know some Spanish, you can notice that’s exactly the same as adding an “indirect object pronoun” (which, of course, corresponds to the Croatian DL case) to sentences like these:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n(Spanish) <em>Se cayó.</em> <i>It fell.</i>\n</p><p>\n(Spanish) <em>Se <u>me</u> cayó.</em> <i>I dropped it.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you look into an English-Croatian dictionary, you will probably find that there’s the verb pair <b class=\"hrv\">isp<u>u</u>štati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">isp<u>u</u>stiti</b> («) listed having one meaning <i>drop</i>, but that verbs are not the first choice, especially in speech, when you accidentally drop something!</p>\n<p>If you want to stress that somebody dropped something <em>intentionally</em>, another verb pair is used:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">b<u>a</u>cati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">baciti</b> (A) <i>throw, intentionally drop</i>\n</p>\n<p>A similar difference is expressed with two a bit similar verb pairs that both translate to English as <i>leave</i>:</p>\n<table><tr><td class=\"last\"> \n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>st<u>a</u>vljati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>st<u>a</u>viti</b></td>\n<td class=\"first last\">  + A  </td>\n<td class=\"first last\"></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"last\"> \n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>st<u>a</u>jati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">ostati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>st<u>a</u>ne</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"first last\">  + DL  </td>\n<td class=\"first last\">(accidentally!)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The case roles in the second pair are “rotated”: what is left is in N, while one who was affected (that is, the person who left something by accident) is in DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jakna</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> je ostala u <span class=\"hc-dl\">autu</span>.</b> <i>I left the jacket in the car (accidentally).</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If we would use the first verb pair, it’s not said whether is was intentional or not, could be either way. Notice how the person affected is now the subject, and what is left is object:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>O</u>st<u>a</u>vio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">jaknu</span> u <span class=\"hc-dl\">autu</span>.</b> <i>I left the jacket in the car.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>With many verbs, the same verb is used for both meanings: unintentional events are expressed using the mediopassive (i.e. <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²) and the DL case. Nobody caused the event (at least that’s what we want to say), but the one in DL is somehow involved, or affected. This is a common example:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">razb<u>i</u>jati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">razbiti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">razbije</b>) <i>break</i><br/>\n  + A = intentionally :(<br/>\n  + <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² = “on its own”<br/>\n  + <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² + DL = accidentally ;)\n</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Razbio sam <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">čašu</b>.</b> <i>I broke the glass.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Čaša</span> se</b> razbila.</b> <i>The glass broke.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Čaša</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se</b> razbila.</b> <i>The glass broke</i> ‘<i>on me</i>’.\n</p></div>\n<p>The English has a similar thing, but only colloquially: ‘<i>on me</i>’.</p>\n<p>Again, in the ‘accidental’ construction, what is broken is the subject (observe how the past form is in feminine).</p>\n<p>Hovever, this pair doesn’t exactly mean what English <i>break</i> means. In English, you can <i>break</i> a bone, a branch, a glass, or even a <em>law</em>! Not so in Croatian. There are five different verbs – verb pairs, really – used for different objects (yes, Croatian has <em>a lot</em> of verbs). They are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">English <i>break a...</i></th>\n<th class=\"last\">Croatian verbs</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>branch, bone, leg...</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">lomiti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">s-</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>glass, vase, plate...</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">razb<u>i</u>jati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">razbiti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">razbije</b>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>mechanism, car engine...</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kvariti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">po-</b> («)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>cord, link, transmission...</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">prek<u>i</u>dati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>e</u>k<u>i</u>nuti</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><i>law, regulation, promise...</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">kršiti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> («)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Now, it’s likely not obvious when to use <b class=\"hrv\">lomiti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">s-</b> and when <b class=\"hrv\">razb<u>i</u>jati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">razbiti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">razbije</b>). The first verb is basically about breaking things in two nice pieces, like <i>branches</i>; the second one is about things that <i>shatter</i> or get <i>crumpled</i>. This table summarizes when to use each verb:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">lomiti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">s-</b></th>\n<th class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">razb<u>i</u>jati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">razbiti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">razbije</b>)</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">• sticks, branches<br/>• bones, body parts<br/>• ice </td>\n<td class=\"last\">• glass, ceramics, doors, furniture<br/>• toys, bycycles, cars<br/>• TV sets, various devices</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">• heart (metaphorically)<br/> • people (emotionally)</td>\n<td class=\"last\">• codes and cyphers<br/> • conspiracies, gangs</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Also, the verb pair <b class=\"hrv\">kvariti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">po-</b> («) is used for a very specific kind of <i>breaking</i>: for internal damages of machines, while <b class=\"hrv\">razb<u>i</u>jati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">razbiti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">razbije</b>) implies a visible damage. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Razbila</b> sam <span class=\"hrvc ft-a\"><b class=\"gender-m\">auto</b></span>.</b> <i>I crashed the car.</i> {f}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pokv<u>a</u>rila</b> sam <span class=\"hrvc ft-a\"><b class=\"gender-m\">auto</b></span>.</b> <i>I damaged the car.</i> {f} (internally, its engine)\n</p></div>\n<p>The first four pairs in the table above can be used in the mediopassive construction, and then optionally by adding a person in DL with involuntary meaning, for things that break ‘on you’; for example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Slomio</b> sam <span class=\"hc-a\">granu</span>.</b> <i>I broke the branch.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Pr<u>e</u>k<u>i</u>nuo</b> sam <b class=\"hc-a\">vezu</b>.</b> <i>I broke the connection.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Grana</span> (<b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b>) se <b class=\"hrvc\">slomila</b>.</b> <i>The branch broke</i> (‘<i>on me</i>’).\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Veza</span> (<b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b>) se <b class=\"hrvc\">pr<u>e</u>k<u>i</u>nula</b>.</b> <i>The connection broke</i> (‘<i>on me</i>’).\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\"><b class=\"gender-m\">Auto</b></span> (<b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b>) se <b class=\"hrvc\">pokv<u>a</u>rio</b>.</b> <i>The car broke.</i> (‘<i>on me</i>’).\n</p></div>\n<p>The last pair cannot be manipulated like that; you <em>can</em> transform it into mediopassive, but you <em>cannot</em> add the person involved in DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Vlada</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">prek<u>r</u>šila</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">obeć<u>a</u>nje</span>.</b> <i>The government broke the promise.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Additionally, for the first three pairs, there’s a special verb pair where what breaks is <em>always</em> the subject:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pucati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">puknuti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pukne</b>) <i>break, pop</i> (no object, what broke is the subject!)\n</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Čaša</span> je pukla.</b> <i>The glass broke.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Grana</span> je pukla.</b> <i>The branch broke.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Veza</span> je pukla.</b> <i>The connection broke.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>With it, you can add a person in DL, but it sounds a bit colloquial. So, there are actually <em>six</em> verb pairs covering English <i>break</i>!</p>\n<p>The DL case is a common way to add <em>who’s affected</em> – always a person/animal or a group – to anything. Consider:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Grijanje</span> ne radi.</b> <i>The heating doesn’t work.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The sentence above lacks context: <em>what heating</em>. If it’s not working in your house, you would add a possessive in English: <em>our heating</em>. It can be also done in Croatian, but the preferred way in speech is to add DL:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Grijanje</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1pl\">nam</b> ne radi.</b> <i>Our heating doesn’t work.</i> (lit. ‘<i>doesn’t work to us</i>’)\n</p></div>\n<p>Again, if you know some Spanish, this will all be very familiar to you. This usage is so common that some people call it <em>possessive dative</em>.</p>\n<p>The accidental construction is really just the mediopassive – that is, using <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² to express that we don’t know or don’t want to say who caused it – with a person in DL who was somehow “affected” or “involved”. This is an elegant way to say that what has happened was not intention of that person.</p>\n<p>As you hopefully remember, there’s another construction that uses the mediopassive and the DL case: the “feel-like”. However, it’s easy to distinguish them, since the “feel-like\" uses impf. verbs (usually, but not always, related to fulfilling needs, like <i>drink</i>, <i>eat</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>smoke</i>). Taking the “feel-like” to the extreme, we could say that somebody felt like breaking glasses, but there would be still a difference:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n(1) <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Razbile</b> su <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se <span class=\"hc-n\">čaše</span>.</b> <i>The glasses have broken.</i> (‘<i>on me</i>’)\n</p><p>\n(2) <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Razb<u>i</u>jale</b> su <b class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b> se <span class=\"hc-n\">čaše</span>.</b> also: <i>I felt like breaking glasses.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can see clearly how the sentence #1 uses an perf. verb, while the sentence #2 uses and impf. counterpart. However, the sentence #2 <em>is</em> ambiguous: it could also mean, depending on the context, that glasses were breaking (e.g. you worked in a bar, and glasses were constantly breaking, but it was not your fault, the dishwasher did it, etc.) This is really an extreme, stretched example, which would be very rare in real life.</p>\n<p>Since persons/animals or groups added in DL are just affected by the event, this use of DL is also called <em>dative of interest</em>. Its use extends – mostly colloquially – to sentences where we want somebody to get interested, or when we just emphasize who is/should be interested. So, in colloquial communication, among friends, it’s common to add the DL <b class=\"hrv\">ti</b>² to many sentences when you say something about yourself or someone else, similar to colloquial English <i>you know</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ja</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"2\">ti</b> sutra ne radim.</b> <i>I don’t work tomorrow.</i> (<i>you know</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, if you’re talking to a group, you would use another pronoun:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ja</span> <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"2pl\">vam</b> sutra ne radim.</b>\n</p></div>\n<p>On the other side, when you ask a question, the DL <b class=\"hrv\">mi</b>² is sometimes added to emphasize that you’re interested:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kako si <b class=\"hrvc ft-dl\" data-tip=\"1\">mi</b>?</b> <i>How are you doing?</i> (<i>I’d like to know</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>All these DL’s to express interest are used only colloquially, among close friends and family.</p>\n<p>Another way used in colloquial communication is literally the same as in English, adding <b class=\"hrv\">znaš</b> <i>you know</i> to the beginning:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Znaš</b>, sutra ne radim.</b> <i>You know, I don’t work tomorrow.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(the rest is coming soon...)</p>\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=39567972184721204&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=39567972184721204&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=39567972184721204&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=39567972184721204&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=39567972184721204&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/dative%2Flocative%20case\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\ndative/locative case</span></a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "html": "\n<p>This chapter will explain various constructions which mostly correspond to English <i>one another</i>.</p>\n<p>In such constructions, two adjectives-used-as-pronouns are frequently used together:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">jedan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">jedn-</b>) <i>one</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">drugi</b> <i>other, another</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The simplest examples are when they fill subject and object (or indirect object) roles in a sentence. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedan</span> čeka <span class=\"hc-a\">drugog</span>.</b> <i>One is waiting for another.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedan</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>že <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugom</span>.</b> <i>One is helping another.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedan</span> se igra s <span class=\"hc-i\">drugim</span>.</b> <i>One is playing with another.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This simply means: <i>one person</i> does something to <i>another person</i> (or <i>animal</i>, actually <i>anything</i>). Who these person are is not said, it must be known from the context.</p>\n<p>However, unlike in English, these adjectives-used-as-pronouns are used in plural too, where they stand for <em>groups</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedni</span> čekaju <span class=\"hc-a\">druge</span>.</b> <i>One group is waiting for another group.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedni</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugima</span>.</b> <i>One group is helping another group.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedni</span> se igraju s <span class=\"hc-i\">drugima</span>.</b> <i>One group is playing with another group.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now, in all examples above, we have used only masculine animate gender; when we have mixed-sex sets, or sets of neuter things (<i>trees</i>, <i>eggs</i>) you can use the neuter gender, and in all-female sets, feminine is used:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Jedna</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>že <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugoj</span>.</b> <i>One is helping another.</i> {all-female}\n</p></div>\n<p>For example, the last sentence would be used in a group of girls that do some task together.</p>\n<p>Now, it’s also possible to say <i>they help one another</i>, but that <i>one another</i> part is much more specific in Croatian. For example, two people, <b class=\"hrv\">Marko</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Ivan</b> help each other. We would say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ivan</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Marko</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu </b>[<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">jedan</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugom</span></b>]<b class=\"hrv\">.</b> <i>Ivan and Marko help each other.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now, the words <b class=\"hrv\">jedan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">jedn-</b>) and <b class=\"hrv\">drugi</b> are <em>still in singular</em>: they describe what is going on in detail. One person helps another.</p>\n<p>Of course, if we had two women or girls, we would use the feminine forms:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Ivana</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu </b>[<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">jedna</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugoj</span></b>]<b class=\"hrv\">.</b> <i>Ana and Ivana help each other.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>If we have a mixed-sex pair, it’s common to use neuter forms:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu </b>[<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">jedno</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugom</span></b>]<b class=\"hrv\">.</b> <i>Ana and Goran help each other.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>But you’ll sometimes see masculine animate used for mixed-sex pairs too (this is likely non-standard):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu </b>[<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">jedan</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugom</span></b>]<b class=\"hrv\">.</b> <i>Ana and Goran help each other.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>When you have a situation where individuals and groups help each other, it’s not strictly person-to-person, it’s common to use plural:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Građani</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu </b>[<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">jedni</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugima</span></b>]<b class=\"hrv\">.</b> <i>Citizens help each other.</i>\n</p></div>\n<!--\n\n<p>If we have explicitly two groups as the subject, only plural is used:</p>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Psi</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">mačke</span> m<u>r</u>ze </b>[<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">jedni</span> <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugima</span></b>]<b class=\"hrv\">.</b> <i>Citizens help each other.</i>\n</p></div>\n\n-->\n<p>We have already encountered another reciprocal construction, using <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² and related forms. These forms are, strictly speaking, <em>reflexive</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">si</b> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu.</b>\n<i>Ana and Goran help themselves.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(We have used the reflexive DL <b class=\"hrv\">si</b>², because this verb, of course, requires a person in DL.)</p>\n<p>This sentence is, in principle, a bit ambiguous. It <em>could</em> mean that each of them help themselves, but not another person.</p>\n<p>A way to emphasize <em>mutuality</em> is using the adverb:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">međ<u>u</u>sobno</b>ʷ¹ <i>mutually, one with/to another</i>\n</p>\n<p>This word can’t be exactly translated into English. It’s used in several ways. First, it’s used to remove any ambiguity from sentences like the last one:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> <b class=\"hc-dl\">si</b> </b><b class=\"hrvc\">međ<u>u</u>sobno</b>ʷ¹<b class=\"hrv\"> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu.</b>\n<i>Ana and Goran help one another.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Another use of this adverb is with verbs like <b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jeliti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">po-</b> («) <i>divide</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> su pod<s>i</s>j<u>e</u>lili </b><b class=\"hrvc\">međ<u>u</u>sobno</b>ʷ¹<b class=\"hrv\"> <span class=\"hc-a\">pizzu</span>.</b>\n<i>Ana and Goran divided a pizza among themselves.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s another way to emphasize such forms, using the adjective:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sam</b> <i>alone, on its own</i>\n</p>\n<p>It’s always placed before a <em>stressed</em> form of the pronoun, and must match the subject gender and number:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ana</span> i <span class=\"hc-n\">Goran</span> p<u>o</u>m<u>a</u>žu <b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">sami</b> <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">sebi</b>.</b>\n<i>Ana and Goran help themselves.</i> (<i>nobody else is involved</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>(the rest is coming soon)</p>\n<!--##EXAMPLE##-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"example_78\", \"Examples\")'>\n<span id=\"example_78_ctrl\">↓ Examples (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"example_78\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>This sticker in a fast food restaurant during the COVID-19 outbreak says:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Brinimo <span class=\"hc-n\">jedni</span> o <span class=\"hc-dl\">drugima</span></b>\nlit. <i>‘let’s care ones about others’</i>\n</p></div>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/8Kw35kL/EC-Brinimo-Jedni-ODrugima.jpg\" title=\"Brinimo jedni o drugima\"/>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">brinuti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">brine</b>) <i>care, worry</i> is  here in <em>imper-1pl</em>, and the verb uses a subject in N and an optional object expressed with <b class=\"hrv\">o</b>¨ + DL, which follows, but both words are in plural.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons why plurals are used. First, the graphic on the sticker below the headline clearly shows <b class=\"hrv\">mi</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">vi</b>, i.e. two groups: <em>us</em> (the employees) and <em>you</em> (the guests). So, two groups help each other, and consequently, plurals are used.</p>\n<p>The other reason is that customers are addressed in the respectful way. The <b class=\"hrv\">vi</b> on the sticker could also be about a single customer – this is a plural of respect. It’s then caried to the ‘one another’ construction.</p>\n<p>One thing is certain: plural is <em>not</em> required by the verb being in plural, <b class=\"hrv\">brinimo jedan od drugom</b> would be perfectly fine, but it would have a slightly different meaning!</p>\n</div><!-- EXAMPLE ENDS -->\n<!--##QUIZ##-->\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction Answ_78()\n{ var Answ=[\"s\",\"drugima\",\"Jedna\",\"drugu\"]; return Answ; }\n</script>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"quiz_78\", \"Exercise\")'>\n<span id=\"quiz_78_ctrl\">↓ Exercise (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div class=\"quiz\" id=\"quiz_78\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<form class=\"quiz\">\n<p>Complete the sentences below:</p>\n<p><label><input id=\"HRKBD_need\" onfocusin=\"HRKBD(undefined);\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"HRKbd\"/>Show a pop-up Croatian keyboard</label></p>\n<p class=\"quiz\"><b class=\"hrv\">Jedni ne razgov<u>a</u>raju\n<span onfocusin=\"HRKBD(this)\"><input maxlength=\"20\" name=\"78.a\" size=\"3\" type=\"text\"/></span>\n<span onfocusin=\"HRKBD(this)\"><input maxlength=\"20\" name=\"78.b\" size=\"8\" type=\"text\"/></span>.</b>\n<i>One group doesn’t talk to another.</i></p>\n<p class=\"quiz\"><b class=\"hrv\">\n<span onfocusin=\"HRKBD(this)\"><input maxlength=\"20\" name=\"78.c\" size=\"3\" type=\"text\"/></span>\nm<u>r</u>zi\n<span onfocusin=\"HRKBD(this)\"><input maxlength=\"20\" name=\"78.d\" size=\"5\" type=\"text\"/></span>.</b>\n<i>One hates another.</i> (speaking about two women, girls...)</p>\n<p>(To be expanded.)</p>\n<p>\n<input onclick=\"Provjeri(this.form, Answ_78());\" onfocusin=\"HRKBD(undefined);\" type=\"button\" value=\"Check Answers\"/>\n<input onclick=\"Otkrij(this.form, Answ_78());\" onfocusin=\"HRKBD(undefined);\" type=\"button\" value=\"Reveal an Answer\"/>\n</p>\n</form>\n</div> <!-- QUIZ -->\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8818332484279021896&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8818332484279021896&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8818332484279021896&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8818332484279021896&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8818332484279021896&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/pronouns\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\npronouns</span></a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "title": "EC: 81 Three Men: Group Numbers and Numeric Compounds",
      "html": "\n<p>So far we have learned <em>cardinal numbers</em> (<i>one</i>, <i>two</i>), <em>ordinal numbers</em> (<i>first</i>, <i>second</i>), <em>fractional numbers</em> (<i>half</i>, <i>third</i>), and <em>collective numbers</em> (another set of <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, used with some nouns).</p>\n<p>Croatian has more numbers: this set actually consists of collective <em>nouns</em> which stand for groups of males. They are called <em>group numbers</em>, and are listed here:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<i>both</i> <b class=\"hrv\">ob<u>o</u>jica</b><br/>\n2 <b class=\"hrv\">dvojica</b><br/>\n3 <b class=\"hrv\">trojica</b><br/>\n4 <b class=\"hrv\">četv<u>o</u>rica</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n5 <b class=\"hrv\">pet<u>o</u>rica</b><br/>\n6 <b class=\"hrv\">šest<u>o</u>rica</b><br/>\n7 <b class=\"hrv\">sedm-<u>o</u>rica</b><br/>\netc.\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The noun <b class=\"hrv\">dvojica</b> really stands for <i>two men</i> (or <i>two boys</i> — two males of any kind really). The same holds for all other nouns listed above. The pattern for larger group numbers is: take an ordinal adjective (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">osm-i</b>), remove the final <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> and add either <b class=\"hrv\">-ero</b> or -<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>rica</b>.</p>\n<p>You will sometimes hear versions of adverbs with <b class=\"hrv\">-oro</b> (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">četvoro</b>). They are very common in Bosnia and Serbia, and heard in Croatia as well.</p>\n<p class=\"att\">Group numbers (<b class=\"hrv\">ob<u>o</u>jica</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">dvojica</b>, etc.) are nouns that behave <em>exactly like</em> <b class=\"hrv\">djeca</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">braća</b>, i.e. have feminine singular endings, require feminine singular forms of adjectives, <em>but</em> require verbs in plural!</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Razg<u>o</u>v<u>a</u>rao sam s <b class=\"hrvc hc-i\">ob<u>o</u>jicom</b>.</b> <i>I talked to both men.</i> (or <i>both boys</i>) {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>As e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">djeca</b> <i>children</i>, they require verbs in plural, despite being in feminine singular:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Djeca</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">su</b> <b class=\"tt\"><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>šla<span class=\"ttt\"><b><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>ći</b> <em>past-f</em></span></b>.</b> <i>Children left.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ob<u>o</u>jica</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">su</b> <b class=\"tt\"><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>šla<span class=\"ttt\"><b><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>ći</b> <em>past-f</em></span></b>.</b> <i>Both men left.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>These numbers give us another possibility: you can express <em>counted pronouns</em>, like <i>us two</i>. As you probably expect, the pronoun will be in the genitive case, and the form of the number will depend on the gender, but there’s one twist you probably didn’t expect: <em>pronouns come before numbers</em>. The forms are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">all-male</th>\n<th>mixed</th>\n<th class=\"last\">all-female</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">nas ob<u>o</u>jica</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nas oboje</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">nas obje</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">nas dvojica</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nas dvoje</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">nas dvije</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">nas trojica</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nas troje</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">nas tri</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">etc.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>You get the system: for all-male groups, the specific collective nouns listed above are used; for all-female groups, regular (cardinal) numbers in the feminine gender; for mixed groups, the collective numbers. Colloquially, the mixed sex pattern is very often used even for all-male and all-female groups.</p>\n<p>The constructions above can mean either e.g. <i>us two</i> or <i>two of us</i>. However, there’s a variation, if <i>two of us</i> stands for <i>two out of a larger group of us</i> (e.g. there are five of us in total, and two of us should do something...). In such a case you can use either:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dvoje <span class=\"hc-g\">nas</span></b> <i>two of us, out of a larger group</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dvoje <b class=\"hrvc\">od</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">nas</span></b> (the same, but a bit more precise)\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, instead of <b class=\"hrv\">nas</b>, you can use <b class=\"hrv\">vas</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">njih</b> (stressed forms must be used) to get various expressions:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-g\">njih</span> trojica</b> <i>three of them</i> (all male)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-g\">vas</span> obje</b> <i>both of you</i> (all female)\n</p></div>\n<p>You can also use other quantity adverbs, and quantity adjectives, to quantify personal pronouns. When you use <b class=\"hrv\">neki</b> and similar words with pronouns, the rules change, you have to use <b class=\"hrv\">od</b>¨ + G:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nitko <b class=\"hrvc\">od</b> nas</b> <i>none of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">jedan <b class=\"hrvc\">od</b> nas</b> <i>one of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">netko <b class=\"hrvc\">od</b> nas</b> <i>somebody of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">neki <b class=\"hrvc\">od</b> nas</b> <i>some of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mnogi <b class=\"hrvc\">od</b> nas</b> <i>many of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">svatko <b class=\"hrvc\">od</b> nas</b> <i>each of us</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">nekoliko nas</b> <i>several of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">mnogo nas</b> <i>many of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dosta nas</b> <i>quite a few of us</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">puno nas</b> <i>a lot of us</i><br/>\n <br/>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">svi mi</b> <i>all of us</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Of course, you can use the pronoun <b class=\"hrv\">oni</b> and so on. The rule is: pronoun-like words require <b class=\"hrv\">od</b>¨ + G, adverbs just G, while <b class=\"hrv\">svi</b> behaves like an adjective in such expressions, and both words change.</p>\n<p>But this is not all! There are <em>derived adjectives</em> of the form <em>number</em> + <em>measure</em>. English examples would be <i>10-inch</i> or <i>four-year</i>. In Croatian, they are spelled without a hyphen – in the standard spelling, at least – and the second part must be a (relational) adjective. The first part is derived from the ‘compounding forms’ of numbers:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">‘Compounding’ number forms</th>\n<tr><td class=\"first\">\n1- <b class=\"hrv\">jedno-</b><br/>\n2- <b class=\"hrv\">dvo-</b><br/>\n3- <b class=\"hrv\">tro-</b><br/>\n4- <b class=\"hrv\">čet<b class=\"hrvc\">ver</b>o-</b><br/>\n5- <b class=\"hrv\">peto-</b><br/>\n6- <b class=\"hrv\">šesto-</b><br/>\n7- <b class=\"hrv\">sedmo-</b><br/>\n8- <b class=\"hrv\">osmo-</b><br/>\n9- <b class=\"hrv\">deveto-</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n10- <b class=\"hrv\">deseto-</b><br/>\n11- <b class=\"hrv\">jedanaesto-</b><br/>\n12- <b class=\"hrv\">dvanaesto-</b><br/>\n20- <b class=\"hrv\">dvadeseto-</b><br/>\n100- <b class=\"hrv\">sto-</b><br/>\n200- <b class=\"hrv\">dvjesto-</b><br/>\n1000- <b class=\"hrv\">tisuć<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b>-</b><br/>\n <br/>\n<i>many</i> <b class=\"hrv\">više-</b>\n</td></tr></tr></table>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">tr<u>o</u></b>dnevni</b> <i>three-day</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">četvero</b>g<u>o</u>dišnji</b> <i>four-year</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">četrdeseto</b>g<u>o</u>dišnji</b> <i>forty-year</i>\n</p>\n<p>The linking vowel (<b class=\"hrv\">-o-</b> in most forms) appended to create the compound form is lost in rare cases when an adjective begins with a vowel; it’s not lost if the vowel is a part of the original number:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">deset<u>i</u>nčni</b> <i>10-inch</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sto<u>i</u>nčni</b> <i>100-inch</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Despite being spelled as one word, they often pronounced with two places of stress, one on the number, another on the adjective. (You will occasionally see such adjectives in a non-standard spelling, as two words, or even with a hyphen, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">deset-<u>i</u>nčni</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">deset <u>i</u>nčni</b>)</p>\n<p>They are used as any other adjective:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Sutra <b class=\"tt\">p<u>o</u>činje<b class=\"ttb\">p<u>o</u>č<u>i</u>njati</b></b>\n<b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">tr<u>o</u>dnevni</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> fest<u>i</u>v<u>a</u>l.</span></b>\n<i>A three-day festival begins tomorrow.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bili smo na <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">dv<u>o</u>tjednom</b><span class=\"hc-dl\"> odmoru</span>.</b>\n<i>We were on two-week vacation.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Observe also placing of the indefinite subject after the verb.)</p>\n<p>With forms derived from numbers based on 10 (10, 20, 50, etc.) you’ll sometimes see forms without the vowel <b class=\"hrv\">-o-</b>, that is <b class=\"hrv\">pedesetgodišnji</b> besides usual <b class=\"hrv\">pedeset<b class=\"hrvc\">o</b>godišnji</b>. You will also see non-standard forms derived from numbers 5, 6 and 7, like ones for 4, that is:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n(all colloq.)<br/>\n5- <b class=\"hrv\">pet<b class=\"hrv\">er</b>o-</b><br/>\n6- <b class=\"hrv\">šest<b class=\"hrv\">er</b>o-</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n <br/>\n7- <b class=\"hrv\">sedm<b class=\"hrv\">er</b>o-</b><br/>\n8- <b class=\"hrv\">osm<b class=\"hrv\">er</b>o-</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>When such adjectives – derived from relative adjectives of time periods – are used with people and animals, they mean <i>three-year-old</i>, <i>forty-year-old</i>, etc. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Dovela<span class=\"ttt\"><b>dovesti</b><br/><em>past-f</em></span></b> je <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">šestogodišnjeg</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> sina</span>.</b>\n<i>She brought her six-year-old son.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Note that the words derived from <b class=\"hrv\">šesto-</b> can mean both 6- and 600-; therefore, some people write compounds derived from 600- as <b class=\"hrv\">šeststo-</b>. In real life, confusion is rare – there are very few 600-year-olds around.</p>\n<p>From these adjectives, there are <em>nouns</em> for <i>‘x-year-olds’</i> (i.e. boys/girls, men/women, but occasionally other animals, even some products). They are derived from the ‘compounding forms’ with appended <b class=\"hrv\">godišnji</b> by further appending <b class=\"hrv\">-njak</b> (m) and <b class=\"hrv\">-njakinja</b> (f). As with the most other male/female pairs, the male form is also generic/default:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\">Četver<u>o</u>godišnj<u>a</u>ci</b> vole trčati.</b>\n<i>Four-year-olds like to run.</i> (i.e. <i>Four-year-old kids</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>Believe it or not, there are more words derived from numbers, but I’ll leave them for later.</p>\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3516881745934672079&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3516881745934672079&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3516881745934672079&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3516881745934672079&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3516881745934672079&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/numbers\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\nnumbers</span></a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "html": "\n<p>There’s a group of adjectives derived from many verbs (but not all!) that stand for <em>potential</em>. They are kind of similar to passive adjectives. English has such adjectives too: examples are <i>visible</i> and <em>readable</em>.</p>\n<p>They are usually derived by adding <b class=\"hrv\">-ljiv</b> to the verb root (that is, the infinitive form without <b class=\"hrv\">-ati</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">-iti</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">-jeti</b>, etc.):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">č<u>i</u>tati</b> <i>read</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">čit-</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">čit<b class=\"hrvc\">ljiv</b></b> <i>readable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vidjeti</b> <i>see</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">vid-</b> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">vid<b class=\"hrvc\">ljiv</b></b> <i>visible</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>They are frequently derived from perf. verbs:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>i</u>hv<u>a</u>titi</b> perf. <i>accept</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">prihv<u>a</u>t<b class=\"hrvc\">ljiv</b></b> <i>acceptable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">shvatiti</b> inch. <i>understand</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">shvat<b class=\"hrvc\">ljiv</b></b> <i>understandable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zap<u>a</u>liti</b> («) perf. <i>ignite</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">zap<u>a</u><b class=\"hrvc\">ljiv</b></b> <i>flammable</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>(Of course, inch. is short for <em>inchoative</em>, i.e. start-of-state or start-of-action.)</p>\n<p>The stress of such adjectives seems to be always on the syllable just before the last one (that is, one before <b class=\"hrv\">-ljiv</b>).</p>\n<p>Few verbs that end in <b class=\"hrv\">-siti</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-sati</b> have pot. adj. ending only in <b class=\"hrv\">-siv</b>. Common ones are:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pod<u>e</u>siti</b> perf. <i>adjust</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">pod<u>e</u><b class=\"hrvc\">siv</b></b> <i>adjustable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pren<u>o</u>siti</b> <i>transport</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">pren<u>o</u><b class=\"hrvc\">siv</b></b> <i>portable</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>If the consonant that would come before <b class=\"hrv\">-ljiv</b> is <b class=\"hrv\">n</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">nj</b>, it gets fused with <b class=\"hrv\">lj</b>; some adjectives have both forms:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">prom<s>i</s>j<u>e</u>niti</b> perf. <i>change</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">promj<u>e</u><b class=\"hrvc\">njiv</b></b> / <b class=\"hrv\">promj<u>e</u><b class=\"hrvc\">nljiv</b></b> <i>variable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">hraniti</b> <i>feed</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">hra<b class=\"hrvc\">njiv</b></b> <i>nutritious</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sumnjati</b> <i>suspect</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">sum<b class=\"hrvc\">njiv</b></b> <i>suspicious</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>(You will sometimes see the spelling <b class=\"hrv\">sum<b class=\"hrvc\">lj</b>iv</b>; that’s considered non-standard and a gross error by some people.)</p>\n<p>Verbs that have <em>pres-3</em> ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b> usually don’t derive such adjectives with <b class=\"hrv\">-ljiv</b>, but with <b class=\"hrv\">-iv</b>, and they appear more similar to the infinitive form:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">jesti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">jede</b>) <i>eat</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">jest<b class=\"hrvc\">iv</b></b> <i>eatable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">op<u>i</u>sati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>p<u>i</u>še</b>) perf. <i>describe</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">op<u>i</u>s<b class=\"hrvc\">iv</b></b> <i>describable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">saviti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">savije</b>) perf. <i>bend</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">sav<u>i</u>t<b class=\"hrvc\">ljiv</b></b> <i>flexible</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>If the verb contains a sequence <b class=\"hrv\">-<s>i</s>je-</b>, it’s shortened in the potential adjective to <b class=\"hrv\">-je-</b> or just <b class=\"hrv\">-e-</b> (after <b class=\"hrv\">r</b>, preceded by another consonant):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">d<b class=\"hrvc\"><s>i</s>je</b>liti</b> <i>divide, share</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">d<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>ljiv</b> <i>divisible</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">l<b class=\"hrvc\"><s>i</s>je</b>piti</b> <i>glue, stick</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">l<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>pljiv</b> <i>sticky</i>\n</p>\n<p>As in English, negated versions of some potential adjectives are more common then non-negated. The negation is done by simply appending <b class=\"hrv\">ne-</b> to the front. Common negated potential adjectives are:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">neraz<u>u</u>mljiv</b> <i>incomprehensible</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">neshv<u>a</u>tljiv</b> <i>inexplicable</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">neun<u>i</u>štiv</b> <i>indestructible</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nev<u>i</u>dljiv</b> <i>invisible</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">piti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pije</b>) <i>drink</i> doesn’t have a regular potential adjective, but a specific adjective is used:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pitak</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pitk-</b>) <i>drinkable, potable</i></p>\n<p>Also, a frequent negative potential adj. has an unexpected form:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">nezaboravan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">nezaboravn-</b>) <i>unforgettable</i></p>\n<p>Some potential adjectives stand for active ability, especially when someone likes to do something, or often does something; this happens mostly for verbs related to <em>talking</em>. For example:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">paziti</b> <i>take care</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">pažljiv</b> <i>careful</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pričati</b> <i>tell</i> (stories) → \n<b class=\"hrv\">pričljiv</b> <i>talkative</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">šaliti se</b>² <i>joke</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">šaljiv</b> <i>funny, humorous</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">šutjeti</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">šutiti</b> <i>be silent</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">šutljiv</b> <i>silent</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>vj<u>e</u>riti</b> <i>convince</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">uvj<u>e</u>rljiv</b> <i>persuasive</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Few more adjectives have (apparently) non-potential meaning and often active meaning:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dirati</b> <i>touch</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">dirljiv</b> <i>touching, emotional</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">hraniti</b> <i>feed</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">hranjiv</b> <i>nutritious</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>sj<u>e</u>titi</b> inch. <i>feel</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">osj<u>e</u>tljiv</b> <i>sensitive</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">smrdjeti</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">smrditi</b> <i>stink</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">smrdljiv</b> <i>foul-smelling</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">strpjeti</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">strpiti se</b>² perf. <i>be patient</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">strpljiv</b> <i>patient</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">št<u>e</u>djeti</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">št<u>e</u>diti</b> <i>save</i> (money, resources) → \n<b class=\"hrv\">štedljiv</b> <i>thrifty, economical</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">uzb<u>u</u>diti</b> («) perf. <i>excite</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">uzb<u>u</u>dljiv</b> <i>exciting</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zan<u>i</u>mati</b> («) <i>be interesting</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">zan<u>i</u>mljiv</b> <i>interesting</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Today, the main meaning of <b class=\"hrv\">uzb<u>u</u>dljiv</b> is <i>exciting</i> – something or somebody that excites others – but you’ll sometimes see it used in meaning <i>excitable</i> – something or somebody that can be excited by others.</p>\n<p>With the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">osj<u>e</u>tljiv</b>, you can express what you’re sensitive <i>to</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">osj<u>e</u>tljiv</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨ + A = <i>sensitive to</i>\n</p>\n<p>Croatian has a great number (likely, thousands) of verbs ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-irati</b>; most of them have been borrowed from German and other western languages. Examples are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">analiz<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>analyze</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ignor<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>ignore</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">imit<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>imitate</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pak<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>pack</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(As you have probably already learned, such verbs always have the stress on the same syllable). In English, you can create potential adjectives from these verbs – <i>analyzable</i>, <i>ignorable</i>, <i>imitable</i> and <i>packable</i>. Unfortunately, <em>this is not possible in Croatian</em>! There’s no “<b class=\"hrv\">ignor<u>i</u>rljiv</b>” or “<b class=\"hrv\">ignor<u>i</u>riv</b>” (try entering these words into Google™).</p>\n<p>There are more examples where English has a potential adjective, but there’s no matching potential adjective in Croatian; for example:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<i>enjoyable</i><br/>\n<i>inhabitable</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>livable</i><br/>\n<i>walkable</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"att\">You should remember that not all verbs have potential adjectives, even if it would make sense. You’ll have to use relative clauses if you need such meanings.</p>\n<p>Unlike passive adjectives, most potential adjectives are comparable (and always use the <b class=\"hrv\">-iji</b> suffix). The stress moves to the suffix (<b class=\"hrv\">ljiv</b>):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pažljiv</b> <i>careful</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">pažlj<u>i</u>viji</b> <i>more careful</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vidljiv</b> <i>visible</i> →\n<b class=\"hrv\">vidlj<u>i</u>viji</b> <i>more visible</i>\n</p>\n<p>Similar in form to potential adjectives – but not in meaning – are adjectives derived by adding <b class=\"hrv\">-av</b>. There are only a couple of them derived from verbs in frequent use:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">brbljati</b> <i>chit-chat</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">brblj<b class=\"hrvc\">av</b></b> <i>chatty</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prljati</b> <i>soil, pollute</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">prlj<b class=\"hrvc\">av</b></b> <i>dirty</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>This suffix is used to derive adjectives from certain nouns:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dlaka</b> <i>body hair, animal hair</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">dlakav</b> <i>hairy</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">hrđa</b> <i>rust</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">hrđav</b> <i>rusty</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#82-diff\" title=\"Click for regional variations\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">krv</b> f <i>blood</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">krvav</b> <i>bloody</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">m<u>i</u>š<u>i</u>ć</b> (») <i>muscle</i> → \n<b class=\"hrv\">mišićav</b> <i>muscular</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>These adjectives <em>never</em> have a case-base with the <b class=\"hrv\">-a-</b> dropped, while adjectives which end in <b class=\"hrv\">-av</b> for other reasons sometimes have, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">mrtav</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">mrtv-</b>) <i>dead</i>. (Do you remember when I wrote, way back, that <b class=\"hrv\">-a-</b> is not always dropped?)</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"82-diff\">® In Serbia and Bosnia, words for <i>rust</i> and <i>rusty</i> don’t have the initial <b class=\"hrv\">h</b>: they have forms <b class=\"hrv\">rđa</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">rđav</b>.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_82\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_82_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_82\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>The use of <b class=\"hrv\">-iv</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">-ljiv</b> to produce adjectives with active meaning is actually older. Probably one of the oldest passive potential adjectives was (<b class=\"hrv\">ne</b>)<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>i</u>dljiv</b> (<i>in</i>)<i>visible</i>. The use of such adjectives expanded much in the 19th and 20th centuries, but they are much older.</p>\n<p>The seemingly random use of <b class=\"hrv\">-iv</b> vs. <b class=\"hrv\">-ljiv</b> led to attempts by some Croatian linguists to basically invent and prescribe clear-cut rules, but they all failed. It’s, however, been noted that after <b class=\"hrv\">-t</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">-ljiv</b> is almost always used; for the rest, the actual rules are so complicated that it’s easier simply to remember these adjectives.</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<!--##EXAMPLE##-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"example_82\", \"Examples\")'>\n<span id=\"example_82_ctrl\">↓ Examples (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"example_82\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>This billboard, advertising a popular newspaper, explains that they’re <i>“insensitive to critiques”</i> because they’re <i>sensitive to social injustice</i>.

      "html": "\n<p>I’ll explain several useful verbs and verb families here, and also introduce a couple of advanced topics.</p>\n<p>The first verb family is derived in this pattern:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">tvoriti</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">o-tv<u>a</u>rati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">o-tv<u>o</u>riti</b> («)\n</p>\n<p>The base verb, <b class=\"hrv\">tv<u>o</u>riti</b>, is quite rare. The derived pairs are not:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">prefix</th>\n<th>used with</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">o-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>open</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pri-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>leave ajar</i> (<i>‘almost close’</i>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">za-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>close</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b></td>\n<td>A (<b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ A)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>transform</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">s-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>create</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>show up</i> (colloq.)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>There’s not much to say about the first three verbs: they express <i>open</i> and <i>close</i> – either literal (<i>window</i>, <i>shop</i>), or metaphoric (<i>discussion</i>, <i>person</i>).</p>\n<p>The last two verbs have specific meanings. The <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> verb is similar to transport verbs derived by <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b>: it uses <em>destinations</em> (expressed by <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨ + A) and optionally also <em>origins</em> (expressed by <b class=\"hrv\">iz</b>¨ + G, matching the destination). The verb is used with either an object in A, or a <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² (mediopassively, if something transforms ‘on its own’):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Mali</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> pr<u>o</u>bl<u>e</u>m</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">se</b> <b class=\"hrv\">pretv<u>o</u>rio</b> <b class=\"hrvc\">u <span class=\"hc-a\">veliki</span></b>.</b>\n<i>A small problem has transformed into a big one.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The verb pair <b class=\"hrv\">otv<u>a</u>rati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">otv<u>o</u>riti</b> («) <i>open</i> can illustrate a fine point when perfective verbs are used and where not. If you opened a window, and then closed it – and it’s a bit cold now in the room – and you want to express with a single verb what you did, you would use the <em>imperfective</em> verb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Otv<u>a</u>rao sam <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span>.</b> <i>I opened the window.</i> {m} (It’s maybe closed now.)\n</p></div>\n<p>If you use the impf. verb, it doesn’t imply that the window is open now, or that it remained open for some time – but such things would be implied if you would use the perf. verb:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Otv<u>o</u>rio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span>.</b> <i>I’ve opened the window.</i> {m} (And it’s open now.)\n</p></div>\n<p>This is the ‘standing outcome’ principle. This is because perf. verbs <em>focus on the outcome</em>, but the outcome – state of the window – is not relevant here (or not expected). It’s important that you touched it. An obvious way to say it’s not open anymore is this:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Otv<u>o</u>rio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span> i posl<s>i</s>je <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"3m/n\">ga</b> zatv<u>o</u>rio.</b> {m} <i>I’ve opened the window and closed it later.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>So, the second verb ‘undoes’ the first. It’s actually more general: <em>only the last perfective verb in the sequence counts</em>. That is, if you say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Otv<u>o</u>rio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span> i oprao <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"3m/n\">ga</b>.</b> <i>I’ve opened the window and washed it.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>It would imply only <i>it’s washed now</i>, not whether it’s open or closed. This is a very subtle, but important principle: only the <em>last outcome in a sequence ‘stands’</em>. We could paraphrase it as <em>the last outcome standing</em>! This likely sounds extremely complicated, but an example will make it (hopefully) clear (‘standing outcomes’ are in red):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">example</th><th class=\"last\">implies</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Išla<span class=\"ttt\"><b>ići</b><br/><em>past-f</em></span></b> sam u <span class=\"hc-a\">trg<u>o</u>vinu</span>.</b><br/>\n<i>I was going/went to the shop.</i> {f}</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>imperfective!</em><br/><u>no implications</u> whatsoever</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc ttc\"><u>O</u>t<u>i</u>šla<span class=\"ttt\"><b><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>ći</b><br/><em>past-f</em></span></b> sam u <span class=\"hc-a\">trg<u>o</u>vinu</span>.</b><br/>\n<i>I’ve gone to the shop.</i> {f}</td>\n<td class=\"last\">(I’m in the shop)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\"><u>O</u>t<u>i</u>šla<span class=\"ttt\"><b><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>ći</b><br/><em>past-f</em></span></b> sam u <span class=\"hc-a\">trg<u>o</u>vinu</span> i <b class=\"hrvc\">kupila</b> <span class=\"hc-a\">pivo</span>.</b><br/>\n<i>I went to the shop and bought beer.</i> {f}</td>\n<td class=\"last\">(I have some beer)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\"><u>O</u>t<u>i</u>šla<span class=\"ttt\"><b><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>ći</b><br/><em>past-f</em></span></b> sam u <span class=\"hc-a\">trg<u>o</u>vinu</span>, kupila <span class=\"hc-a\">pivo</span> i <b class=\"hrvc\">popila</b> <b class=\"ft-a\" data-tip=\"3m/n\">ga</b>.</b><br/>\n<i>I went to the shop, bought beer and drank it.</i> {f}</td>\n<td class=\"last\">(no beer; I might be drunk)</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"tt\">Pala<span class=\"ttt\"><b>pasti</b><br/><em>past-f</em></span></b> sam.</b><br/>\n<i>I fell.</i> {f}</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>involuntary event!</em><br/><u>no implications</u></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>However, the ‘standing outcome’ doesn’t apply to all perf. verbs – <em>only to voluntary</em> ones. Check the last row: <b class=\"hrv\">pala sam</b> doesn’t imply I’m still on the floor: it’s not something I did voluntary. It just happened.</p>\n<p>Note that the impf. verb <em>doesn’t really say</em> we got to the shop at all. It just says we were going there, there was <em>some</em> action. But if we don’t say there were some problems on the way there, it’s enough. So the default, shortest way of saying something with a ‘standing outcome’ – if the ‘standing outcome’ doesn’t hold anymore – would be actually using the impf. verb.</p>\n<p>Therefore, perf. involuntary verbs are used much more often than voluntary ones.</p>\n<p>In real life, this rule is not completely clear-cut: you will hear both just <b class=\"hrv\">išla sam u trg<u>o</u>vinu</b> and <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>šla sam u trg<u>o</u>vinu</b> for completed actions in the past <em>and</em> for speaker being obviously not in the shop anymore.</p>\n<p>The important thing is that you will hear impf. verbs where you would naively – due to completion – expect perf. ones. Always keep in mind that perf. verbs are not just about completed actions, but also about the <em>outcomes</em>, especially for voluntary actions\n – and the outcome of <i>going somewhere</i> is <i>being there</i>.</p>\n<p>There’s another way to distance yourself from a past action expressed by a voluntary perfective verb – by using another tense, not yet described: the so-called <em>plusquamperfect tense</em> (in English, the name is often simplified to <em>pluperfect tense</em>). It roughly corresponds to <i>he had opened</i> and like.</p>\n<p>The tense is formed like the common past tense, but there’s an extra <em>past</em> form of the verb <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² +), in the same gender and number as the other <em>past</em> form:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Gledala sam <span class=\"hc-a\">film</span>.</b> <i>I watched the movie.</i> {f}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Bila</b> sam gledala <span class=\"hc-a\">film</span>.</b> (pluperfect)\n</p></div>\n<p>You can visualize it as putting the verb in the past twice:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr>\n<td>present</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">gledam</b> <i>I’m watching</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>  ↓</td><td>  ...put the verb <b class=\"hrv\">gledati</b> into the past</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>past</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">gledala sam</b> <i>I was watching</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>  ↓</td><td>  ...put the verb <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² +) into the past</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>pluperfect</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">bila sam gledala</b> <i>I had been watching</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Using this tense, we can put a distance from the action – there’s no ‘standing outcome’:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bio sam otv<u>o</u>rio <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span>.</b> <i>I had opened the window.</i> {m} (But it was maybe closed later.)\n</p></div>\n<p>It also serves to emphasize actions and states, like I was <em>really</em> doing it, I <em>really</em> did it, it has <em>really</em> happened:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bila sam gledala <span class=\"hc-a\">film</span>.</b> <i>I was really watching the movie.</i> {f}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Bio sam otv<u>o</u>rio <span class=\"hc-a\">prozor</span>.</b> <i>I did open the window.</i> {m} (despite it being closed now)\n</p></div>\n<p>However, this tense is actually rare in speech, just check these Google™ results (in thousands, from the .hr domain):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">kupio sam</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">142</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">bio sam kupio</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">kupio sam bio</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">18<br/>19</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>You will find this tense occasionally in literature. There are actually even more tenses you’ll see sometimes in writing; they will be described in 99 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"99.html\">Aorist Tense and Other Marginal Features</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s go back to verbs. The next family is weird – there’s no base verb (or pair) – all verbs have prefixes. They are made attaching prefixes to this:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">-pr<u>e</u>mati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">-pr<u>e</u>miti</b> («)\n</p>\n<p>Common verbs in this family are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">prefix</th>\n<th>used with</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">o-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>equip</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pos-</b></td>\n<td>A (dest)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>tidy, put to place</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pri-</b></td>\n<td>A (<b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ A1)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>prepare</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">s-</b></td>\n<td>A (dest)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>put to its place</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#86-spremati\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<i>make ready</i> *</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">do-</b></td>\n<td>A (dest)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>deliver</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The pair derived with <b class=\"hrv\">pri-</b> has a simple meaning, <i>prepare</i>. It’s used with an object or with a <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pripr<u>e</u>mio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">ručak</span>.</b> <i>I’ve prepared lunch.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pripr<u>e</u>mio sam se.</b> <i>I’ve prepared (myself).</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>You can express <i>what for</i> the preparation was with <b class=\"hrv\">za</b>¨ + A:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Pripr<u>e</u>mio sam se <b class=\"hrvc\">za <span class=\"hc-a\">put</span></b>.</b>\n<i>I’ve prepared for the trip.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>The most interesting verb pair is <b class=\"hrv\">spremati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">spremiti</b> (since the prefix is merely a consonant, the stress shift in the present tense is not possible – the stress is always on the first syllable).</p>\n<p>This verb pair has the basic meaning: <i>bring something/someone to the optimal/requested state</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#86-spremati\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>. It’s basically used for three things. First, to put things back to their places, e.g. if a book is out of its usual place (shelf), a toy is out of the box, etc.:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Spremio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">knjige</span>.</b>\n<i>I’ve put the books back in place.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>If the place is expressed, it’s a <em>destination</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Spremio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">knjige</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">na <span class=\"hc-a\">policu</span></b>.</b>\n<i>I've put the books back to the shelf.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>Then, this pair covers the meanings expressed by the <b class=\"hrv\">pri-</b> pair:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Spremio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">ručak</span>.</b> <i>I’ve prepared lunch.</i> {m}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Spremio sam se.</b> <i>I’ve prepared (myself).</i> i.e. <i>I’ve got ready.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>Finally, the third meaning is <i>tidy</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Spremio sam <span class=\"hc-a\">sobu</span>.</b> <i>I’ve tidied the room</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>Next, there are two interesting verb families. One is derived like this:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">vršiti</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">do-vrš<u>a</u>vati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">do-v<u>r</u>šiti</b> («)\n</p>\n<p>The base verb is sometimes used, in meaning <i>do, make</i>. Three derived pairs are quite common:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">prefix</th>\n<th>used with</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">do-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>finalize, complete</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>carry out, execute</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">za-</b></td>\n<td>A</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>end, terminate</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>One derived pair matches the meaning of a phase verb pair I’ve already introduced:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poč<u>i</u>njati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>č<u>i</u>nje</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>činje</b>) ~ \n<b class=\"hrv\">početi</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">počne</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">počeo</b>) <i>start</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">završ<u>a</u>vati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">zav<u>r</u>šiti</b> («) <i>end</i>\n</p>\n<p>This verb pair is very useful:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">navik<u>a</u>vati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">n<u>a</u>v<u>i</u>knuti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">n<u>a</u>v<u>i</u>kne</b>) (AX / <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²) (<b class=\"hrv\">na</b> YA) <i>get/become used</i> (X) (<i>to</i> Y)\n</p>\n<p>You’ll see this pair with the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pri-</b> with roughly the same meaning, and with the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">od-</b> in the opposite meaning, like colloquial English ‘<i>get unused</i>’.</p>\n<p>Next, there are four common verb pairs derived from this ‘pair’:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">-ključ<u>i</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-klj<u>u</u>čuje</b>) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">-klj<u>u</u>čiti</b> («)\n</p>\n<p>Common verbs in this family are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">prefix</th>\n<th>used with</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">is-</b></td>\n<td>A (orig)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>exclude, switch off</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pri-</b></td>\n<td>A (dest)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>join, connect, plug in</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u-</b></td>\n<td>A (dest)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>include, switch on</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">za-</b></td>\n<td>A / CC</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>conclude</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>(The rest is coming soon)</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"86-spremati\">\n<p>® In Serbia, the verb pair <b class=\"hrv\">spremati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">spremiti</b> means only <i>prepare</i>, never <i>put to its place</i>;

      "html": "\n<p>In this chapter, I will explain how various derived nouns, such as <i>player</i>, <i>playroom</i> and <i>playground</i> are derived in Croatian.</p>\n<p>The simplest nouns derived from verbs are of <i>‘player’</i> type. You simply remove the infinitive ending, and the vowel before it (if any) and add <b class=\"hrv\">-ač</b>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">verb</th>\n<th

<i>watchmaker</i> is still derived from it.</p>\n<p>With this suffix, the stress is basically unpredictable, as you can see, but it seems that with verbs, the more common pattern is the stress on the first syllable, while nouns derived from nouns get the ‘western’ stress on <b class=\"hrv\">-ar</b>, and the standard stress on the syllable before it – and the standard stress is again movable.</p>\n<p>The suffix <b class=\"hrv\">-ar</b> derives nouns from <em>verb roots</em>, which might be visible only in past forms or in the present tense:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\"><b

class=\"hrv\">zlatnik</b> <i>gold coin</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Finally, a couple of verbs have two derived nouns — one for the person who is kind of ‘giving’, and another for the one who is ‘receiving’.

      "html": "\n<!-- spans fixed -->\n<p>In this chapter, we finally cover all the remaining numbers and number-like words.</p>\n<p>First, you can use suffix <b class=\"hrv\">-ak</b> to create <em>numbers</em> (not adjectives!) that correspond to English <i>-odd</i>. They are formed only from ‘round’ numbers, such as:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">des<u>e</u>tak</b> <i>ten-odd</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">dvades<u>e</u>tak</b> <i>twenty-odd</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">stot<u>i</u>njak</b> <i>hundred-odd</i>\n</p>\n<p>Such numbers behave like 10, 20 and 100 – i.e. like quantity adverbs – G-<em>pl</em> is used with them, and the whole phrase behaves as neuter singular:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Des<u>e</u>tak</b> <span class=\"hc-g\">ljudi</span> je na <span class=\"hc-dl\">plaži</span>.</b> <i>Ten-odd people are on the beach.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are <em>nouns</em> derived from smaller numbers using <b class=\"hrv\">-ica</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">-ka</b> (the derivation is not regular, forms must be remembered):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n1 → <b class=\"hrv\">jed<u>i</u>n<b class=\"hrvc\">ica</b></b><br/>\n2 → <b class=\"hrv\">dvojka</b><br/>\n3 → <b class=\"hrv\">trojka</b><br/>\n4 → <b class=\"hrv\">četv<u>o</u>rka</b><br/>\n5 → <b class=\"hrv\">p<u>e</u>t<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>i</u>ca</b></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n6 → <b class=\"hrv\">š<u>e</u>st<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>i</u>ca</b></b><br/>\n7 → <b class=\"hrv\">s<u>e</u>dm<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>i</u>ca</b></b><br/>\n8 → <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>sm<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>i</u>ca</b></b><br/>\n9 → <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>e</u>v<u>e</u>tka</b><br/>\n10 → <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>e</u>s<u>e</u>tka</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>They mean e.g. ‘<i>digit two</i>’, or colloquially, something with the number on it, e.g. a <i>playing card</i>, <i>bus</i> or <i>tram</i> – depending on the context:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Čekat ću <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">š<u>e</u>st<u>i</u>cu</b>.</b>\n(colloq.) <i>I’ll wait for a number 6 tram.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>However nouns derived from 1, 3 and 4 have special meanings as well:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">jed<u>i</u>nica</b> <i>unit</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trojka</b> <i>three-person team</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">četv<u>o</u>rka</b> <i>four-person team</i>\n</p>\n<p>(English sometimes uses a noun for the <i>three-person team</i>, taken from Russian: <i>troika</i>. You see it’s almost identical to Croatian.)</p>\n<p>For <i>two-person teams</i> (and other two-item groups), the common word is <b class=\"hrv\">par</b> <i>pair</i>.</p>\n<p>There is another type of compound adjectives and adverbs derived with numbers and <b class=\"hrv\">-struk</b>, standing for <em>multiplicity</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">Multiplicity adjectives</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">jednostruk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>one-fold, single-layer</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dvostruk</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">dupli</b> (colloq.)\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>double</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">trostruk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>triple</i>\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">čet<b class=\"hrvc\">ver<u>o</u></b>struk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>fourfold</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pet<b class=\"hrvc\">er<u>o</u></b>struk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>5-fold</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">šest<b class=\"hrvc\">er<u>o</u></b>struk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>6-fold</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n...\n</td><td class=\"last\">...\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">deset<b class=\"hrvc\">er<u>o</u></b>struk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>10-fold</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n...\n</td><td class=\"last\">...\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">dvadeset<b class=\"hrvc\">er<u>o</u></b>struk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>20-fold</i>\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">stostruk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>100-fold</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mnogostruk</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">višestruk</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><i>multiple, manifold</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>As you can see, they are derived from numbers in a specific way – mostly from the ‘compounding forms’, but for numbers 5 and over, there’s extra -<b class=\"hrv\">er<u>o</u></b>- inserted between the ‘compounding form’ and the suffix <b class=\"hrv\">-struk</b>.</p>\n<p>While all these words are really used, some, like <b class=\"hrv\">jedanaester<u>o</u>struk</b> <i>11-fold</i> are very rare. All these words are adjectives, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Razgov<u>a</u>rali smo s <b class=\"hrvc hc-i\">trostrukim</b><span class=\"hc-i\"> prv<u>a</u>cima</span> <span class=\"hc-g\">Europe</span>.</b> <i>We talked to three-time European champions.</i> (lit. ‘<i>triple champions of Europe</i>’)\n</p></div>\n<p>The adjectives <b class=\"hrv\">mnogostruk</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">višestruk</b> are very common.</p>\n<p>All these adjectives, in neuter form, are used as adverbs too, so you can tell how many times something is better:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Novi</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> mobitel</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">dvostruko</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">bolji</span>.</b> <i>The new cellphone is twice better.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Novi</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> mobitel</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\">duplo</b> <span class=\"hc-n\">bolji</span>.</b> (colloq., the same meaning)\n</p></div>\n<p>Instead of <b class=\"hrv\">dvostruk</b>, the colloquial word <b class=\"hrv\">dupli</b> is very common in speech.</p>\n<p>There are more adjectives that use this pattern; the most common are ones derived with <b class=\"hrv\">-stran</b> <i>sided</i>, such as:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">obostran</b> <i>both-sided</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">šesterostran</b> <i>six-sided</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Three more suffixes with this pattern are commonly used:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">-djelan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-djeln-</b>) <i>having X parts</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">-kratan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-kratn-</b>) <i>having X parts</i> (in time)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">-značan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-značn-</b>) <i>having X meanings</i>\n</p>\n<p>All three are normally combined only with smaller numbers and <b class=\"hrv\">više-</b>. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <span class=\"hc-a\">dvodjelni</span><span class=\"hc-a\"> kupaći</span><span class=\"hc-a\"> k<u>o</u>st<u>i</u>m</span>.</b> <i>I have a two-piece swimming suit.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>So far, all these words were derived from cardinal numbers (<i>one</i>, <i>two</i>...) but some words are derived from <em>ordinal</em> numbers (<i>first</i>, <i>second</i>...); for example, nouns for students in various grades of the primary school:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>r</u>v<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>1st grader</i><br/> <!--- regional! --->\n<b class=\"hrv\">dr<u>u</u>g<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>2nd grader</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tr<u>e</u>ć<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>3rd grader</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">četv<u>r</u>t<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>4th grader</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>e</u>t<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>5th grader</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">š<u>e</u>st<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>6th grader</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>e</u>dm<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>7th grader</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>sm<u>a</u>š</b> (») <i>8th grader</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Feminine forms are derived with <b class=\"hrv\">-ica</b>, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">prv<u>a</u>šica</b>.</p>\n<p>Then, there are a couple of adjectives derived from ordinal numbers, but they usually use only the first three ordinal numbers, e.g.:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">prvorazredan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">prvorazredn-</b>) <i>first-class</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">drugorazredan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">drugorazredn-</b>) <i>second-class</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trećerazredan</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">trećerazredn-</b>) <i>third-class</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>(the rest is coming soon)</p>\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=65559828431313816&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=65559828431313816&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=65559828431313816&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=65559828431313816&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=65559828431313816&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/numbers\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\nnumbers</span></a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "html": "\n<p>The song is ambitious and offers some interesting observations about the Croatian society, but it also reveals some stereotypes. First, everyone agrees the country is beautiful (many even think it’s <em>rich</em>), but it’s very easy to find garbage heaps and quite ugly industrial landscapes in Croatia.</p>\n<p>Second, there’s a tendency in liberal/left-oriented parts of the Croatian society – which completely dominate in central parts of Zagreb, where <b class=\"hrv\">Elem<u>e</u>ntal</b> is from, and in some other cities, notably, <em>ones with the ‘western’ pronunciation</em>, like Varaždin, Rijeka and Pula – to think “symmetrically”. An example are these lines:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Slušamo <span class=\"hc-a\">savjete</span></b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>We listen to advices </i>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-g\">hodže</span>, <span class=\"hc-g\">popa</span> i <span class=\"hc-g\">prote</span></b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>From a ‘hodža’, a priest and a ‘prota’</i>\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pa štancamo <span class=\"hc-a\">djecu</span>...</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<i>So we mass-produce children...</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">hodža</b>, a Turkish loan, means <i>Islamic preacher</i>; the word <b class=\"hrv\">prota</b> – a shortened form of <b class=\"hrv\">protojerej</b> – is a higher priest in the Serbian Orthodox Church. However, in Croatia, any influence of Islam is basically non-existent, and the Serbian Orthodox Church is marginal. Mentioning the three religions side by side is a stereotype, inherited from the days of Yugoslavia. The only region where all three religions maybe had a comparable influence was and is Bosnia-Herzegovina; even there, these three religions had and have different roles and influence. Finally, the last line is simply wrong – the birth rate in Croatia is quite low, <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility\">below the replacement rate</a>; having more that 3 children is very rare, and having only one kid is quite common. (The verb <b class=\"hrv\">štancati</b> is colloquial, it means <i>mass-produce</i>, from German <em>stanzen</em>, <i>press, punch</i> in manufacturing.)</p>\n<p>Having a quite negative view of any (local) religion is very common in liberal parts of the Croatian society; interestingly, the same people sometimes can have a more positive view of less common religions in Croatia, such as Buddhism.</p>\n<p>The song also echoes an important debate in Croatia: why isn’t Croatia as developed as Germany, Switzerland, France or the Netherlands? Who is to blame? <b class=\"hrv\">Tko je kriv?</b> Some say Yugoslavia, others say general ‘eastern’ influences (usually summed up as <b class=\"hrv\">B<u>a</u>lk<u>a</u>n</b> <i>the Balkans</i>, as in this song). Or are <em>we</em> to blame (as implied by this song)?<p>\n<p>Note that this question implies another stereotype: Croatia <em>should</em> be, and maybe <em>should have been already</em> as developed as Germany or France.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that’s far from obvious, especially for a country where in 1880 about 70% of people were illiterate (Dalmatia was even worse: almost 90%). Croats have <em>always</em> compared themselves against the richest and most developed countries in Europe and in the world. You can get in your car (or on a bus) in Zagreb in the morning – you’ll have to refuel somewhere in Germany – and reach the other side of Europe, the North Sea shore near Amsterdam in the evening of the same day, without breaking speed limits: very developed countries are quite close to Croatia. The Netherlands had a higher literacy rate in 1630 than Croatia in 1900.</p>\n<p>Maybe... it simply takes some time?</p>\n</p></p></div>\n<!--##EXAMPLE_END##-->\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4682902534827945922&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4682902534827945922&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4682902534827945922&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4682902534827945922&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4682902534827945922&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</p></p></p></p></div>"

      "html": "\n<p>This chapter will give a brief overview of words and expressions used in some Croatian traditions.</p>\n<p>There are two process-completion verb pairs for <i>marry</i>: one is from the female perspective, another from the male perspective:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\">female: </td>\n<td class=\"nopad\"><b class=\"hrv\">ud<u>a</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>daje</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²\n~* <b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>dati</b> <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td class=\"nopad\">male:</td>\n<td class=\"nopad\"><b class=\"hrv\">ženiti</b> <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²\n~* <b class=\"hrv\">o-</b> («)\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>You would use the first pair if the subject is a woman, and the second verb if the subject is a man.</p>\n<p>However, if the subject is a couple, the male version is used:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Ož<u>e</u>nit će se.</b> <i>They will get married.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Such reciprocal use of this verb pair is very common, but some Standard Croatian manuals don’t accept it, and suggest using another, gender-neutral verb pair (which is a bit archaic, and seldom used in speech):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">vjenč<u>a</u>vati</b> («) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²\n~* <b class=\"hrv\">vj<u>e</u>nčati</b> <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² <i>marry</i> (Std; rare in speech)\n</p>\n<p>It’s possible, but slightly old-fashioned to use both verb pairs without the <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²: then the subjects are <i>parents</i>, while one who gets married is the object – again, if your daughter gets married, you would use the first verb, if your son gets married, the second one.</p>\n<p>Note these pairs are clearly of the process-completion type, but one is derived by prefixes, others aren’t: derivation is not always clear cut.</p>\n<p>The most important holidays in Croatia are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Božić</b> <i>Christmas</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uskrs</b> <i>Easter</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Nova godina</b> <i>New Year</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Svi sveti</b> <i>All Saints’ Day</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>All except <b class=\"hrv\">Nova godina</b> <i>New Year</i> are Christian holidays. As most people in Croatia are Catholics, they are celebrated on the same dates as in most West European and North American countries <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#92-holidays\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>. It’s a custom to give presents (esp. to children) for Christmas. The day before Christmas, when preparations are made, has a special name, but it’s not an official holiday (many people, if they are able to, will take a day of vacation, but others will work):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Badnjak</b> <i>Christmas Eve</i>\n</p>\n<p>All these days, except the All Saint’s Day, will have specially prepared meals (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Badnjak</b> will have fish). On the All Saint’s Day, many people will visit family graves (since great crowds gather at that day, many people will visit graves few days earlier or a day later).</p>\n<p>Another holiday of some importance is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Prvi maj</b> (colloq.) <i>May 1st</i>\n</p>\n<p>Observe how its name diverts from the usual grammar rules, you would rather expect <b class=\"hrv\">Prvi</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dan mjeseca</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">maja</b>.</p>\n<p>From these holidays, relational adjectives are derived by <b class=\"hrv\">-ni</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-nji</b>, except for May 1st:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Božić</b> <i>Christmas</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">božićni</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Uskrs</b> <i>Easter</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">uskrsni</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">uskršnji</b> <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Nova godina</b> <i>New Year</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">novog<u>o</u>dišnji</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Prvi maj</b> (colloq.) <i>May 1st</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">prvomajski</b>\n</p>\n<p>There are no relational adjectives derived from <b class=\"hrv\">Svi sveti</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">Badnjak</b> in common use.</p>\n<p>In some regions, esp. with more religious (Catholic) people, there’s a tradition to celebrate various holidays dedicated to Virgin Mary.</p>\n<p>As in some other countries, there’s a period in late winter, known as <i>Carnival</i>, when masked processions and specific rituals occur <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#92-carnival\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>. It culminates on the Tuesday 41 days before Easter. There are various names in Croatia, the common ones are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">karn<u>e</u>v<u>a</u>l</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">fašnik</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">maškare</b> f pl.<br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mesopust</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">poklade</b> f pl.<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pust</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">fašnik</b> is most common in Zagreb and the northwestern area; other names prevail elsewhere. For instance, this billboard advertises <b class=\"hrv\">fašnik</b> in Samobor, a town close to Zagreb:</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMjUzOTI5M18/EC_SamoborskiFasnik.jpg\" title=\"Samoborski fašnik\"/>\n</p>\n<p>(Pay attention how Samobor is transformed into the relational adjective <b class=\"hrv\">samoborski</b>). Meanwhile, this poster announces <b class=\"hrv\">pust</b> in Matulji, a small town close to R<s>i</s>jeka:</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMjUzOTM5N18/EC_PustMatulji2018.jpg\" title=\"Samoborski fašnik\"/>\n</p>\n<p>(The poster is in the local dialect of Matulji and generally surroundings of Rijeka; e.g. instead of <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨, the preposition is <b class=\"hrv\">va</b>¨, some case endings are different, etc. The term <b class=\"hrv\">pust</b> is also used in Slovenia.)</p>\n<p>This custom varies in different parts of Croatia, its barely present in some parts (e.g. Slavonia), while in other parts (esp. northern part of the coast) it’s a major tradition and a great celebration.</p>\n<p>(the rest is coming soon)</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"92-holidays\">\n<p>® In Serbia, and parts of Bosnia where there’s a majority of Serbs, religious holidays are celebrated on different dates, according to the tradition of the Serbian Orthodox Church.</p>\n<p>In Bosnia, esp. in parts with a large Muslim population, additional holidays, usually known as <b class=\"hrv\">Bajram</b> are celebrated according to Muslim traditions.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"92-carnival\"><i>Carnival</i> traditions are uncommon in Bosnia and Serbia.</p>\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3521629834901363403&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3521629834901363403&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3521629834901363403&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3521629834901363403&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=3521629834901363403&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "title": "EC: 93 Learn to Crawl: Verbs, Verbs... All Perfective",
      "html": "\n<p>I’ve introduced the verb aspect many chapters ago, and explained some details in later chapters. This chapter will wrap up all the missing parts.</p>\n<p>First, <em>some</em> impf. verbs have special perf. verbs that are sometimes called ‘delimitative’. They are hard to exactly translate to English, but the idea is there was some action or state for some time, or space, not less.</p>\n<p>For example, you have to go to work and work there for 8 hours. You can simply say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Radio sam osam <span class=\"hc-g\">sati</span>.</b> <i>I worked for eight hours.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>However, you call also stress that you’ve fulfilled your duty for that day, by using a derived <em>perfective</em> verb <b class=\"hrv\">odr<u>a</u>diti</b> («); nothing else is changed:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Odr<u>a</u>dio sam osam <span class=\"hc-g\">sati</span>.</b> <i>I worked for eight hours.</i> {m} (focus on the time)\n</p></div>\n<p>This verb sometimes corresponds to English <i>work off</i> or <i>put in</i> (hours), but there’s no single English construction which has the exact meaning.</p>\n<p>Such verbs <em>always</em> start with <b class=\"hrv\">od-</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">ot-</b> and are especially used when you fulfill a duty, or what you did is taken off from a bigger requirement (e.g. you have to work 40 hours a week, you did 8 today, 32 to go).</p>\n<p class=\"att\">These verbs are an exception from the general rule that you can’t specify how long with a perfective verb. In fact, with many such verbs, you <em>have</em> to specify the duration, because this is the whole point of such verbs.</p>\n<p>Another common such verb is:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">odsp<u>a</u>vati</b> («) perf. <i>sleep for a time</i>\n</p>\n<p>For example, you can say:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Odsp<u>a</u>vala sam deset <span class=\"hc-g\">sati</span>.</b> <i>I slept for ten hours.</i> {f} (focus on the time)\n</p></div>\n<p>The time doesn’t have to be precise, you can say that you <i>slept for a few hours</i>.</p>\n<p>Second, some impf. verbs have <em>two</em> related perfective verbs, making an <b class=\"hrv\">od</b>/<b class=\"hrv\">do</b> pair. Such verbs are always related to motion. The most important verb means literally <i>travel</i>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">process (impf.)</th>\n<th></th>\n<th class=\"last\">kind-of-completion (perf.)</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first vcent\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">put<u>o</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>u</u>tuje</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"vcent\">↗<br/>↘</td>\n<td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">ot</b>put<u>o</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">ot</b>p<u>u</u>tuje</b>) ‘<i>away</i>’<br/><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">do</b>put<u>o</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">do</b>p<u>u</u>tuje</b>) ‘<i>to</i>’\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>At the first look, it might seem it’s a triplet for start (i.e. inchoative), process and completion, but it’s a bit more complicated. The <b class=\"hrv\">od-</b>/<b class=\"hrv\">ot-</b> verbs in such triplets emphasize <i>leaving</i>. The <b class=\"hrv\">do-</b> verbs stand only for completion understood as <i>coming</i> somewhere, to a temporary or permanent “base”.</p>\n<p>This is a quite fine difference. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">P<u>u</u>tujemo u <span class=\"hc-a\">Split</span>.</b> <i>We’re traveling to Split.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Otput<u>o</u>vali smo u <span class=\"hc-a\">Split</span>.</b> <i>We’ve departed to Split.</i> {m/mixed}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Doput<u>o</u>vali smo u <span class=\"hc-a\">Split</span>.</b> <i>We’ve arrived in Split.</i> {m/mixed}\n</p></div>\n<p>The second sentence doesn’t focus on really reaching the destination, it’s in principle possible they failed to get there; the third sentence is about coming to the destination.

Some of the matching impf. verbs for the verbs in the table above are really rare: the search for e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">otplovljavao</b> returns only 4 hits, and the expected <b class=\"hrv\">otplivavao</b> is not found at all (it can’t be found in dictionaries either).</p>\n<p>In my opinion, you don’t have to pay attention to these additional impf. verbs at all. Even without them, there are <em>a lot of verbs</em> in Croatian!</p>\n<p>The verbs above also have perfective verbs derived with <b class=\"hrv\">u-</b>, and the meaning is <i>fly in</i>, <i>walk in</i>, etc. These verbs must be used with destinations, and not simple objects:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Upl<u>o</u>vili su u <span class=\"hc-a\">luku</span>.</b>\n<i>They sailed into the harbor.</i> {m/mixed}\n</p></div>\n<p>For such verbs, matching impf. verbs are a bit more common, because you can repeatedly <i>fly</i> or <i>walk in</i> (or be in a middle of the process). They are <b class=\"hrv\">ul<s>i</s>j<u>e</u>tati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><u>u</u>l<s>i</s>j<u>e</u>će</b>), and so on.</p>\n<p>Third. This was all a bit complicated, I guess, but there was some logic behind it. Now, there are two more prefixes used with these verbs (and some others) where it feels more chaotic. They are <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b>. They <em>roughly</em> correspond to English <i>over</i> and <i>through</i>.</p>\n<p>However, with some of verbs above – and some others – the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> creates very special inchoative verbs:</p>\n<table class=\"worldlist\">\n<tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>gl<u>e</u>dati</b> ‘<i>start watching</i>’<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">proh<u>o</u>dati</b> («) <i>start walking</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>pl<u>i</u>vati</b> <i>start swimming</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>p<u>u</u>zati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>p<u>u</u>že</b>) <i>start crawling</i>  </td>\n<td class=\"nopad brack\"> </td>\n<td class=\"nopad\">  </td>\n<td class=\"last vcent\">‘absolute inchoatives’<br/>(gain an ability)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>They mean: <i>start doing something</i>, what you were <em>previously unable to</em>, uncapable to do. For example, you didn’t know how to swim, and you started swimming for the first time ever. Or a baby learned to crawl. Or a kitten or a puppy opened their eyes (both are born with their eyelids closed).</p>\n<p>An example (from an Internet forum):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kad su <span class=\"ft-dl\" data-tip=\"2pl\">vam</span> <span class=\"hc-n\">djeca</span> proh<u>o</u>dala?</b>\n<i>When did your children learn to walk?</i> (lit. ‘<i>start walking</i>’)\n</p></div>\n<p>(As you see, the possession is expressed by a pronoun in DL, which is common for family members.)</p>\n<p>There are no matching impf. verbs for them.</p>\n<p class=\"att\">Note that this meaning is quite unexpected. The verb <b class=\"hrv\">proč<u>i</u>tati</b> does <i>not</i> mean ‘<i>start reading because you learned how</i>’, but <i>have read something to the end</i>.</p>\n<p>I sometimes get questions like <em>can you please list meanings of all verb prefixes, so I can guess the meaning of prefixed verbs</em>...</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that. Prefixes did have meanings in a very distant past, but over many centuries, the meaning has changed for many prefixed verbs. (The same holds in English sometimes: there’s no way you can guess the meaning of the verb <i>understand</i> from its parts <i>under</i> and <i>stand</i>. The only possible guess would be stand under some cover, below something.)</p>\n<p>Note that the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> creates such <em>absolute inchoatives</em> only for abilities which are <em>natural</em> for people (and animals considered similar to humans and close to them, i.e. mammals). You would expect that when birds start flying because they learned how, something like <b class=\"hrv\">prol<u>e</u>tjeti</b> («) is used, but that verb is simply not used in that meaning, ever. It, if used, means simply <i>fly through</i>, e.g. if a bird flies through an open window.</p>\n<p>With the verb <b class=\"hrv\">cvj<u>e</u>tati</b> <i>blossom</i>, this prefix creates a common inchoative <b class=\"hrv\">procvj<u>e</u>tati</b>, which doesn’t imply that plant blossoms for the first time.</p>\n<p><i>A lot of verbs</i>. Including interesting and unexpected verbs.</p>\n<p>The other prefix, <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b>, creates something a bit less exciting: it simply means that the motion was <i>over</i>, <i>across</i> something, that you got from one side to the other (an example from the Internet, about a 21-year-old girl who decided to swim over major straits across the world):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Hrvatska</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> daljinska</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> pliv<u>a</u>čica</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> Dina</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> Levačić</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">pr<u>e</u>pl<u>i</u>vala</b> je <span class=\"hc-a\"> Gibraltarski</span><span class=\"hc-a\"> tjesnac</span>.</b>\n<i>Croatian long-distance swimmer Dina Levačić has swum across the Gibraltar strait.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> is used with all travel-like motion verbs. This table summarizes the prefixes we’ve covered in this chapter so far, on the example of <b class=\"hrv\">plivati</b>, which uses all of them:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"3\">Typical perfective verbs derived from <b class=\"hrv\">plivati</b> <i>swim</i></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\"><i>start swimming</i> (<i>learn how to swim</i>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">za-</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\"><i>start swimming</i> (<i>literally</i>, nothing with learning)</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ot-</b></td>\n<td><i>swim off</i>, <i>away</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"3\">+ orig. / dest.</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">do-</b></td>\n<td><i>arrive</i> (<i>by swimming</i>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u-</b></td>\n<td><i>swim into</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ot-</b></td>\n<td><i>swim</i> (a distance: <i>meters</i>, <i>km</i>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"2\">+ A</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b></td>\n<td><i>swim</i> (<i>over a river</i>, <i>lake</i>, <i>bay</i>...)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For this verb, the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">ot-</b> really has two meanings, the second one is like <b class=\"hrv\">odsp<u>a</u>vati</b> («), but with a distance (e.g. if you train swimming, and you have to swim some distance).</p>\n<p>For many verbs, the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> means <i>all through</i>. The main example is the first verb we started with:</p>\n<p class=\"worldlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">proput<u>o</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">prop<u>u</u>tuje</b>) perf. <i>travel all over</i>\n</p>\n<p>Again, there’s no matching impf. verb; the verb means that you have traveled a lot over some territory, expressed as a simple object in A:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Proput<u>o</u>vala</b> je <span class=\"hc-a\">sv<s>i</s>jet</span>.</b>\n<i>She traveled all over the world.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(Note that <b class=\"hrv\">proč<u>i</u>tati</b> perf. <i>read</i> essentially falls into this pattern: <i>read from the start to the end</i>).</p>\n<p>Two important verbs use both <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> with similar, but different meanings. The prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> here means the action was from start to the end (and possibly more), while <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> means it was uninterrupted in some critical moment or time (like skipping <i>over</i> an obstacle). They are <b class=\"hrv\">spavati</b> <i>sleep</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">živjeti</b> <i>live</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">prosp<u>a</u>vati</b> («) perf. <i>sleep</i> (a period of time)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">presp<u>a</u>vati</b> («) perf. <i>sleep through</i> (something that can wake you up)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prož<u>i</u>vjeti</b> («) perf. <i>live through</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prež<u>i</u>vjeti</b> («) perf. <i>live through, not getting killed</i> = <i>survive</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>English doesn’t have so fine differences, but it has <i>survive</i>; however, note that English <i>survive</i> also means <i>live longer than someone else</i> (e.g. <i>his children survived him</i>). Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">prež<u>i</u>vjeti</b> («) is used only with things which could (even metaphorically) kill you, and, hopefully, your parents weren’t among them.</p>\n<p>These four verbs are all used with simple objects in A; a couple of examples for the <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> verbs:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Presp<u>a</u>vala</b> sam <span class=\"hc-a\">budilicu</span>.</b>\n<i>I slept through the alarm clock.</i> {f}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Prež<u>i</u>vjeli</b> smo <span class=\"hc-a\">vožnju</span> <span class=\"hc-i\">aut<u>o</u>busom</span>.</b>\n<i>We survived the bus ride.</i> (lit. ‘<i>ride by bus</i>’) {m/mixed}\n</p></div>\n<p>Now examples for the <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> verbs; the usual object for <b class=\"hrv\">prosp<u>a</u>vati</b> («) is <b class=\"hrv\">noć</b> f <i>night</i>, but you can use other periods of time:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Prož<u>i</u>vjeli</b> su <span class=\"hc-a\">l<s>i</s>jep</span><span class=\"hc-a\"> život</span> zajedno.</b>\n<i>They lived a nice life together.</i> {m/mixed}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Prosp<u>a</u>vao</b> sam <span class=\"hc-a\">jutro</span>.</b>\n<i>I slept the whole morning.</i> {m}\n</p></div>\n<p>Since these four verbs have objects in A, they can form passive adjectives, and <b class=\"hrv\">nepr<u>o</u>sp<u>a</u>van</b> <i>sleepless</i> (lit. ‘<i>unslept through</i>’) is quite common.</p>\n<p>The verbs <b class=\"hrv\">prež<u>i</u>vjeti</b> («) and <b class=\"hrv\">prož<u>i</u>vjeti</b> («) do have matching impf. verbs – <b class=\"hrv\">preživlj<u>a</u>vati</b> («) and <b class=\"hrv\">proživlj<u>a</u>vati</b> («) – that are used sometimes; the <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b> verb implies also living poorly, barely, while the <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> verb can be used also if your life is not really in danger. Interestingly, the perf. verbs derived from <b class=\"hrv\">spavati</b> don’t have matching impf. verbs, at least I’ve never heard or seen them!</p>\n<p><em>Is there maybe a principle behind this</em>, after all? It seems the prefix <b class=\"hrv\">pro-</b> means, after all, <i>through</i>. Perf. verbs like <b class=\"hrv\">prob<u>u</u>šiti</b> («) <i>drill through</i> show this meaning. As we saw, <b class=\"hrv\">proč<u>i</u>tati</b> means <i>read the book all through</i>. Now it’s possible to explain the absolute inchoatives: maybe the first was <b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>gl<u>e</u>dati</b>, because puppies and kittens struggle to look ‘<i>through</i>’ their eyelids. Once their sight makes through them, they look around them for the first time.</p>\n<p>But what about verb pairs like:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">provjer<u>a</u>vati</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>vj<u>e</u>riti</b> <i>check, verify</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">proizv<u>o</u>diti</b> («) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pro<u>i</u>zvesti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">proizv<u>e</u>de</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">pro<u>i</u>zveo</b>) <i>produce, manufacture</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">propis<u>i</u>vati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">prop<u>i</u>suje</b>) ~ <b class=\"hrv\">prop<u>i</u>sati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>o</u>p<u>i</u>še</b>) <i>prescribe, regulate</i>\n</p>\n<p>It’s hard to connect their meaning with <i>through</i>. The first two pairs are, actually, loans from Russian. Russian is a closely related language and has almost the same prefixes, but their meaning can be a bit different than in Croatian. The second pair is for sure, ultimately based on Latin <em>prōdūcere</em>; however, <em>prō-</em> in Latin means <i>forward</i> and not <i>through</i>. Maybe someone in Russia, centuries ago, did a bad translation from Latin...</p>\n<p>The last pair is similar to the German verb <em>vorschreiben</em> with the same meaning, but again German <em>vor-</em> is rather <i>before</i>, while <em>durch-</em> is the prefix meaning <i>through</i>. So close, but not a match. Russian uses a verb which is a literal translation from German (Russian has a lot of verbs like that): <b class=\"hrv\">predpis<u>a</u>t’</b> (this is the perfective verb, in Croatian spelling, its meaning is obvious). So... I don’t know.</p>\n<p>There is <em>a kind of</em> system, but there were so many loans, so many literal translations from other languages where prefixes have wider meanings, that the system is useless for learners. This was only for your amusement.</p>\n<!--\n<p>This is the same difference as between these pairs:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u>d</b>l<u>a</u>ziti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u>t<u></b>i</u>ći</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">ode</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u>t<u></b>i</u>šao</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u>t<u></b>i</u>šla</b>) <i>leave, depart</i><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">d<u>o</u></b>l<u>a</u>ziti</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">do</b>ći</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">do</b>đe</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">do</b>šao</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">do</b>šla</b>) <i>come</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>(The rest is coming soon.)</p>\n\n-->\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"93-diff\">® The <em>pres-3</em> form <b class=\"hrv\">šeće</b> is specific to Croatia; in Bosnia and Serbia, the form <b class=\"hrv\">šeta</b> is used only.</p>\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_93\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_93_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_93\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>If the verb <b class=\"hrv\">otplivavati</b> doesn’t exist in dictionaries, if it’s not used at all, where did I get that form from?

Most perfective event verbs in <b class=\"hrv\">-ati</b> form impf. counterparts with <b class=\"hrv\">-avati</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ivati</b>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">isk<u>a</u>šlj<b class=\"hrvc\">ati</b></b> («) perf. <i>cough out</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">iskašlj<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>a</u>vati</b></b> impf.<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>i</u>sk<u>u</u>h<b class=\"hrvc\">ati</b></b> («) perf. <i>boil</i> (<i>thoroughly</i>) → <b class=\"hrv\">iskuh<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>a</u>vati</b></b> impf.<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u>k<u>u</u>š<b class=\"hrvc\">ati</b></b> («) perf. <i>try</i> → <b class=\"hrv\">pokuš<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>a</u>vati</b></b> impf.<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">prep<u>i</u>s<b class=\"hrvc\">ati</b></b> («) perf. <i>copy</i> (<i>by hand</i>) → <b class=\"hrv\">prepis<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>i</u>vati</b></b> impf.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Specifically, the verbs in <b class=\"hrv\">-v-ati</b> usually get <b class=\"hrv\">-avati</b>, resulting in <b class=\"hrv\">-v-avati</b>; therefore the form I made.</p>\n<p>This is not unusual: Croatians will sometimes – when they want to stress repetion of some action – make an impf. form of a perf. event verb on the spot, using analogies with other event pairs!</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=5661135735376887992&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=5661135735376887992&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=5661135735376887992&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=5661135735376887992&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=5661135735376887992&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "html": "\n<p>This chapter should give you most common <em>phrases</em>, i.e. constructions which have a special, unexpected meaning.</p>\n<p>First, we start with phrases where certain nouns are used as ‘places’, sometimes used both as locations and destinations, but the meaning is not a place, but some other attribute.</p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, expressions like <b class=\"hrv\">na ručku</b> could be understood as phrases too, but they also involve being somewhere to have a lunch, and such activities are quite predictable and easy to understand.</p>\n<p>Some ‘places’ are harder to understand. One of the most common is <b class=\"hrv\">red</b>, which was already introduced in 55 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"55.html\">More Prepositions</a>; to recap:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ti</span> si <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> <span class=\"hc-dl\"><b class=\"hrvc\">redu</b></span>.</b>\n<i>It’s your turn.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Nisam još došla <b class=\"hrvc\">na</b> <span class=\"hc-a\"><b class=\"hrvc\">red</b></span>.</b>\n<i>My turn didn’t come yet.</i> {f}\n</p></div>\n<p>When used with <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨, the meaning changes completely to <i>OK</i>, <i>alright</i>; sometimes, it’s used as a destination, it corresponds to English <i>put into order</i> and similar phrases.</p>\n<p>This table summarizes the most common ‘places’:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">prep.</th>\n<th>‘place’</th>\n<th>loc.</th>\n<th>dest.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning (<i>be...</i>)</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">forma</b></td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>physically fit</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">igra</b></td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>involved</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">obzir</b></td>\n<td>(+)</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>in play, in consideration</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">povoj</b>, <em>pl</em> <b class=\"hrv\">povoji</b></td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>in early stages</i>, <i>in infancy</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u</b>¨</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">red</b></td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>(+)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>OK</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrv\">konj</b></b></td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>(+)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>on to a good thing</i><br/><i>home free</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">na</b>¨</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrv\">red</b></b></td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>someone’s turn</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Then, there are phrases which look like <em>origins</em>, but actually express <i>how</i> something happened; common ones are:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n    <b class=\"hrv\">iz <span class=\"hc-g\">vedra</span><span class=\"hc-g\"> neba</span></b>\n<i>completely unexpectedly</i>, <i>out of the blue</i><br/>\n</p><p>  \n    <b class=\"hrv\">iz <span class=\"hc-g\">čista</span><span class=\"hc-g\"> mira</span></b>\n<i>completely unprovoked</i> <br/>\n</p></div>\n<p>As you can see, adjectives in these phrases have a bit strange genitive forms. These are a bit archaic, so-called <em>indefinite</em> forms; they will be further explained in 99 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"99.html\">Aorist Tense and Other Marginal Features</a>. Usual forms are used too, as you can see from the statistics on the .hr domain by Google™, in thousands:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz čista mira</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">61</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz čistog mira</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\">10</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Then, there are many phrases when you say that something has some propertly to the extreme using comparison with some term; for example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n    <b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">On</span> je <b class=\"hrvc\"><span class=\"hc-n\">glup</span> kao <span class=\"hc-n\">stup</span></b>.</b>\n<i>He’s dumb as a stump.</i> (i.e. <i>extremely stupid</i>)\n</p></div>\n<p>This table lists common adjective + <b class=\"hrv\">kao</b> + noun phrases:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">phrase</th>\n<th class=\"last\">meaning</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">glup kao stup</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>...</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">bl<s>i</s>jed kao krpa</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">bl<s>i</s>jed kao zid</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><i>...</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The rest is coming soon :)</p>\n<!--\n\nhttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/275665463.pdf\n\nhttps://forum.wordreference.com/threads/when-it-came-my-turn.3354730/\n\nhttp://ihjj.hr/mreznik/uploads/38f60305d77634497dc314ab82fef3bb.pdf\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/clanak/301625\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/clanak/195153\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/clanak/7126\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/clanak/104401\n\n!! voditi računa o...\n\n-->\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8777025933736293532&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8777025933736293532&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8777025933736293532&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8777025933736293532&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=8777025933736293532&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "title": "EC: 95 HRT,  SMS: Acronyms",
      "html": "\n<p>In this chapter, I’ll focus on so-called <em>acronyms</em>. These are words made of first letters of some phrase, e.g. NASA, USA, UN.</p>\n<p>In both English and Croatian, some acronyms are made from native expressions (like USA in English) but some are borrowed (e.g. KGB – do you know what it stands for?). Croatian has more borrowed acronyms than English.</p>\n<p>Writing them is not really a mystery, but how are they pronounced? In English, they are either pronounced either as ordinary words (e.g. NASA) or letter by letter (e.g. USA).</p>\n<p>In Croatian, they are pronounced in four ways.</p>\n<p>The <em>first way</em> is to pronounce them simply <em>as normal words</em> (the same as in English NASA). This happens if there are 3 letters at least, and the first letter is a consonant, while the second is a vowel; for example:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">CIA</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">FER</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">FIFA</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HAC</b><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HAK</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HAZU</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HEP</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">KUD</b><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">LED</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">MUP</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">NASA</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">NATO</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">RAI</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">RAM</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ZAMP</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ZET</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>So, <b class=\"hrv\">NASA</b> is simply pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">Nasa</b> in Croatian. Futhermore, <b class=\"hrv\">R</b> is not considered a vowel in acronyms (so <b class=\"hrv\">HRT</b>, the acronym for <i>Croatian Radio and Television</i>, is normally not pronounced like a normal word).</p>\n<p>Some acronyms above stand for Croatian organizations and bodies: <b class=\"hrv\">HAC</b> is the <i>Croatian Highway Authority</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">HAK</b> is a semi-official association of automobile drivers in Croatia, <b class=\"hrv\">HEP</b> sells electric power and heat, <b class=\"hrv\">FER</b> is a department of the University of Zagreb, <b class=\"hrv\">ZAMP</b> enforces publishing and performing rights of musicians in Croatia (cafe and restaurant owners who play any music must pay rights to them), <b class=\"hrv\">KUD</b> is an association dedicated to folklore, <b class=\"hrv\">MUP</b> is a department that manages police, personal ID’s and firefighters, and <b class=\"hrv\">ZET</b> manages public transport in Zagreb somewhow.</p>\n<p>Pronunciation as normal words also happens if an acronym consists of a vowel (or two vowels) + a consonant + <b class=\"hrv\">A</b>, for example:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ETA</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">IKA</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">IRA</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">UEFA</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(<b class=\"hrv\">IKA</b> is a Catholic News Agency in Croatia; the rest are well-known organizations.)</p>\n<p>Additionally, some acronyms having two consonants, followed by a vowel, followed by a consonant are pronounced as simple words too, for example:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">KSET</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">SKUC</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Some acronyms don’t fit into the patterns above, but they are nevertheless pronounced as normal words; the most frequent examples are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">Un<u>e</u>sko</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">UNICEF</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">Unicef</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Some of these are obviously imported, e.g. check how <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO</b> is pronounced as if having a <b class=\"hrv\">k</b>, but not <b class=\"hrv\">UNICEF</b>!</p>\n<p>One important acronym is an <em>exception</em>: <b class=\"hrv\">SAD</b>, short for <b class=\"hrv\">Sjedinjene Am<u>e</u>ričke Države</b> (i.e. <i>United States of America</i>, lit. <i>United American States</i>) is <em>not</em> pronounced like this, despite starting with a consonant and a vowel.</p>\n<p>The <em>second way</em> is to pronounce acronyms <em>letter by letter</em>, where each letter is pronounced almost like a separate word (e.g. like English pronunciation of USA). Croatian has its \"letters-as-words\" pronunciation, essentially inherited from Latin:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">A</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">a</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">B</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">be</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">C</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ce</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">D</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">de</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">E</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">e</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">F</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">ef</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">G</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ge</b><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">H</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">ha</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">I</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">i</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">K</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">ka</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">L</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">el</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">M</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">em</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">N</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">en</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">O</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">o</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">P</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">pe</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">R</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">er</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">S</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">es</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">T</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">te</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">U</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">u</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">V</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ve</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Z</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ze</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>You can see two things: first, vowels are pronounced simply (<b class=\"hrv\">R</b> is again not treated as a vowel); most consonants are pronounced just as the consonant + <b class=\"hrv\">e</b>, but not all: some are pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">e</b> + the consonant, and two are pronounced as the consonant + <b class=\"hrv\">a</b> (blame the Romans).</p>\n<p>Another thing you can see... where are the other letters? Well, this is what we (and most other langugages in Europe) have inherited from Latin (actually, even <b class=\"hrv\">Z</b> was not originally in Latin, so its pronunciation varies a bit; besides <b class=\"hrv\">ze</b>, you can hear <b class=\"hrv\">zet</b> once a while). What about the rest?<p>\n<p>The rest is much less established: <b class=\"hrv\">J</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Č</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Ž</b> etc. should be (according to style manuals) pronounced as the letter + <b class=\"hrv\">e</b>, while <b class=\"hrv\">Š</b> should be pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">eš</b>. However, in real life, this is quite rare, you’ll see below what actually happens. Patience!</p>\n<p>The letter <b class=\"hrv\">W</b>, appearing in some imported acronyms, is simply pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">ve</b>. The letter <b class=\"hrv\">X</b> is <b class=\"hrv\">iks</b>.</p>\n<p>So, this is how you pronounce e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">BMW</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">HRT</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">NK</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">WC</b>, and <b class=\"hrv\">SAD</b>, an exception mentioned above:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">BMW</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">be</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">em</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>e</u></b> (a car maker)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HRT</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ha</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">er</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">t<u>e</u></b> (<i>Croatian Public Radio and TV</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">NK</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">en</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>a</u></b> (short for <b class=\"hrv\">nogometni klub</b> <i>football club</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">SAD</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">es</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">d<u>e</u></b> (<i>United States of America</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">WC</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ve</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">c<u>e</u></b> (a common abbreviation for <i>toilet</i>)<br/>\n</p>\n<p>It’s interesting that the stress appears to be on the last syllable/component. This way of pronouncing is used for these acronyms and many others:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">CD</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">EKG</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">EU</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">KBC</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">KFC</b><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">KGB</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HDZ</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HNK</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HV</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HZMO</b><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">HZZO</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">IDS</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">PDF</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">PDV</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">PMS</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">RH</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">SDP</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">TV</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">USB</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">UN</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Here, <b class=\"hrv\">HV</b> is the acronym for the <i>Croatian Army</i>; <b class=\"hrv\">HNK</b> is the <i>Croatian National Theater</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">HDZ</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">IDS</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">SDP</b> are political parties; <b class=\"hrv\">HZZO</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">HZMO</b> are health and pension funds, <b class=\"hrv\">KBC</b> is used for major hospitals, <b class=\"hrv\">PDV</b> is <i><a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax\">value-added tax</a></i>, <b class=\"hrv\">EKG</b> is <i>electrocardiogram</i> and so on.</p>\n<p>Any acronyms containing dots (the most important is <b class=\"hrv\">d.o.o.</b>, meaning <i>limited liability company</i>) are also pronounced in this way, so <b class=\"hrv\">d.o.o.</b> is <b class=\"hrv\">de</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">o</b>-<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u></b>.</p>\n<p>Also, names of variables in math are pronounced in this way; the variable <b class=\"hrv\">y</b> is pronounced <b class=\"hrv\">ipsilon</b>.</p>\n<p>Also, letters used as names of rooms, categories, buildings, school groups are always pronounced this way. It’s interesting only characters inherited from Latin are used for this in Croatia; school groups in the 2nd grade will go <b class=\"hrv\">2. a</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">2. b</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">2. c</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">2. d</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">2. e</b>, etc.</p>\n<p>Wait, there’s more: there are two more ways acronyms are pronounced in Croatian!</p>\n<p>The <em>third way</em> is pronouncing each letter ‘natively’, e.g. the letter <b class=\"hrv\">K</b> is pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">kə</b> (that sound was explained in 01 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"1.html\">Alphabet and Pronunciation</a>) and all consonants follow this system. This happens basically if the acronym contains a letter <b class=\"hrv\">J</b> or some other letter not found in Latin (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Š</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Ž</b>). Examples are:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">HZJZ</b> (<i>Croatian Institute of Public Health</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">JNA</b> (<i>Yugoslav People’s Army</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">OŠ</b>  (<i>Elementary school</i>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">SFRJ</b>  (<i>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</i>)<br/>\n</p>\n<p>For example, <b class=\"hrv\">HZJZ</b> is pronounced as <b class=\"hrv\">hə</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">zə</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">jə</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">zə</b>.</p>\n<p>This is how most people in Croatia refer to <em>sounds</em> and <em>letters</em> (not <em>labels</em> or <em>variables</em>). For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\"><b class=\"gender-f\">R<s>i</s>ječ</b></span> <b class=\"tt\">p<u>o</u>č<u>i</u>nje<b class=\"ttb\">p<u>o</u>č<u>i</u>njati</b></b> <!-- ---> s k.</b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">s kə</b>) <i>The word starts with a</i> (<i>letter</i>) <i>k</i>.\n</p></div>\n<p>If you think about it, this is the unambiguous way.</p>\n<p>The <em>fourth way</em> happens when the pronunciation is borrowed together with the acronym; this mostly happens with the following recent loans from English, usually via movies and TV:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">BBC</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>i</u></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">CNN</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">si</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">en</b>-<b class=\"hrv\"><u>e</u>n</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">DJ</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>i</u></b>-<b class=\"hrv\">džej</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">FBI</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ef</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u>j</b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">NBA</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">en</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\"><u>e</u>j</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">PC</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">pi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">si</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">MTV</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">em</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">ti</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>i</u></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">UK</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">ju</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>e</u>j</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>There are also a couple of such acronyms borrowed from French and German:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\nFrench:<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">BCG</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">be</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">se</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">TGV</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">te</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">že</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>e</u></b><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">  \nGerman:<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">VW</b> = <b class=\"hrv\">fau</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>e</u></b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The only option is to remember them.

What <em>gender</em> are they? Do they get <em>case endings</em>? What about derived <em>possessive adjectives</em>?</p>\n<p>Words like <b class=\"hrv\">NASA</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">UEFA</b> are pronounced and understood as normal nouns: they normally change cases and make possessive adjectives. For example, <i>in NASA</i> would be <em>pronounced</em> <b class=\"hrv\">u Nasi</b>, as for any ordinary feminine noun in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b>; <i>from UEFA</i> would be <em>pronounced</em> <b class=\"hrv\">iz U<u>e</u>fe</b>, etc.<p>\n<p>But how are you going to <em>write</em> such words when they get some ending?</p>\n<p>There are three ways, illustrated by some examples from Croatian newspapers:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Velike</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> <b class=\"gender-f\">novosti</b></span> iz <span class=\"hc-g\">U<u>E</u>FA-e</span></b> <i>Big news from UEFA</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Zvonimir</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> Boban</span> <u>o</u>t<u>i</u>šao iz <span class=\"hc-g\">U<u>e</u>fe</span>!</b> <i>Zvonimir Boban has left UEFA!</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Rusi</span> ipak ne <u>i</u>zl<u>a</u>ze iz <span class=\"hc-g\">U<u>E</u>FE</span></b> <i>Russians are not leaving UEFA after all</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The first two ways are considered standard by the official spelling rules, but you’ll see all three in real life; the second one is likely the most common<a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#95-reg\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>. The same happens with possessive adjectives: you’ll see <b class=\"hrv\">UEFA-in</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Uefin</b>. Here are some stats from the .hr domain (via Google™):</p>\n<table class=\"margins\"><tr><td>\n<table class=\"nice nomargins\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz UEFA-e</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">8600</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz Uefe</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">17500</td>\n</tr></table>\n</td><td class=\"spaced\">\n<table class=\"nice nomargins\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">UEFA-in</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">8100</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">Uefin</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">9100</td>\n</tr></table>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(Google™ doesn’t distinguish letter case in searches; <b class=\"hrv\">iz UEFE</b> is the least common way.)</p>\n<p>Acronyms pronounced as words, but not ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-A</b>, are always understood as masculine (inanimate), and change so; spelling of case endings is a much smaller issue for them, because any ending is simply attached:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Upozor<u>e</u>nje</span> iz <span class=\"hc-g\">HAK-a</span></b> <i>A warning from HAK</i> (rarely: <b class=\"hrv\">iz <span class=\"hc-g\">Haka</span></b>)\n</p></div>\n<p>However, there is one more problematic acronym of this type: <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO</b>. It’s masculine inanimate (despite ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-o</b>) but that <b class=\"hrv\">-o</b> is lost in speech whenever you add any ending, so how to write it? You’ll see possessives <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO-v</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO-ov</b> (4:1 in favor of the shorter option), DL forms spelled as <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO-u</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">UNESC-u</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCU</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">Unescu</b> (of course, all are pronounced the same: <b class=\"hrv\">Un<u>e</u>sku</b>). Acronyms really don’t fit well into having a spell-as-you-speak system <em>and</em> case endings!</p>\n<!-------------------->\n<p>Now, let’s move to the acronyms of the <b class=\"hrv\">HRT</b>-type: all these acronyms are usually understood as masculine inanimate, and the final vowel in their pronounciation is never lost (since it’s stressed, recall examples like <b class=\"hrv\">kan<u>u</u></b> <i>canoe</i> from 88 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"88.html\">Weird Words and Constructions</a>):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Rasprava</span> u <span class=\"hc-dl\">UN-u</span></b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b> <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>-<b class=\"hrv\"><u>e</u>nu</b>) <i>Debate in the UN</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Izbori</span> u <span class=\"hc-dl\">HDZ-u</span></b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b> <b class=\"hrv\">ha</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">de</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>e</u>u</b>) <i>Elections in HDZ</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Pucnjava</span> u <span class=\"hc-dl\">SAD-u</span></b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b> <b class=\"hrv\">es</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">d<u>e</u>u</b>) <i>Shooting in the US</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>With acronyms that are pronounced ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> – i.e. acronyms ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-A</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">-K</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-H</b> – there’s some variation: they’re sometimes declined (i.e. they get endings) but you’ll often see them pronounced (and spelled) without case endings, i.e. as indeclinable:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">u HNK-u</b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b> <b class=\"hrv\">ha</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">en</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>a</u>u</b>) <i>in Croatian National Theater</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">u HNK</b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b> <b class=\"hrv\">ha</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">en</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>a</u></b>) (often used, condemned by some style guides)\n</p></div>\n<p>This possibly happens because the brain gets confused a bit: here <b class=\"hrv\">K</b> stands for <b class=\"hrv\">kazalište</b> (a neuter noun); however, it’s <em>pronounced</em> <b class=\"hrv\">ha</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">en</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>a</u></b> (so it sounds like a kind of feminine noun) and it’s <em>spelled</em> <b class=\"hrv\">HNK</b> (like some weird masculine noun). The brain can’t decide what to do, and does nothing. Again, some statistics (here in thousands):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u HNK-u</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">36</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">u HNK</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">80</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>An even more striking example is <b class=\"hrv\">NK</b> (for <i>football club</i>). It’s found before many football clubs, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">NK H<u>a</u>jd<u>u</u>k</b>. Naively, its DL would be <b class=\"hrv\">u NK-u Hajd<u>u</u>ku</b>. This is so rare that Google™ <em>can’t find a single example of it</em>. There are examples of <b class=\"hrv\">u NK Hajd<u>u</u>ku</b> (which is recommended by style manuals), but by far the most common is <b class=\"hrv\">u NK Hajduk</b>, where the first part is not declined because it’s a weird acronym, and the second part is not declined due to the ‘freezing’ explained in 88 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"88.html\">Weird Words and Constructions</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"att\">\n<p>In real life, when using acronyms pronounced letter-by-letter the Latin way and ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-A</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-K</b>, it’s quite common not to add any case endings in both speech and writing. Examples are <b class=\"hrv\">HN<b class=\"hrvc\">K</b></b>, <b class=\"hrv\">NS<b class=\"hrvc\">K</b></b> etc.</p>\n<p>If such an acronym is a part of a name, and the last word is spelled fully (e.g. <b class=\"hrvc\">NK</b> <b class=\"hrv\">H<u>a</u>jd<u>u</u>k</b>) the acronym never changes.</p>\n</div><!-- att -->\n<p>Actually, according to the recent style manual by the <i>Institute of Croatian Language</i>, no acronym used as a part of a name should change, but in real life you’ll often see both <b class=\"hrv\">u KBC-u Rebro</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">u KBC Rebro</b> (that’s the main hospital in Zagreb).</p>\n<p>With acronyms <b class=\"hrv\">RH</b> (for <b class=\"hrv\">Rep<u>u</u>blika Hrvatska</b>) and <b class=\"hrv\">EU</b> (for <b class=\"hrv\">Europska Unija</b>), there’s a strong influence of the full terms, so you’ll see people writing <b class=\"hrv\">EU</b> but pronouncing it fully. One effect is that these abbreviations are often treated as feminine, so you will frequenty read:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">EU</span> je odl<u>u</u>čila...</b> <i>EU has decided...</i> (fem., as <b class=\"hrv\">Unija</b>)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">EU</span> je odl<u>u</u>čio...</b> <i>EU has decided...</i> (masc. inanimate, considered standard)\n</p></div>\n<p>The first option is quite common in media and casual writing, which annoys the language police a bit.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the orthography manual by the <i>Institute of Croatian Language</i> says that <b class=\"hrv\">RH</b> never gets any endings.</p>\n<p>Some of these acroynms stand for countable things, and they can have plural forms. The masculine ones have basically always plural in <b class=\"hrv\">-ovi</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-evi</b>:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">OPG</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">OPG-ovi</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">PDF</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">PDF-ovi</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(<b class=\"hrv\">OPG</b> basicaly means <i>family farm</i>.)</p>\n<p class=\"att\">Masculine acronyms pronounced letter-by-letter have plural in <b class=\"hrv\">-ovi</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-evi</b> (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">PDF-ovi</b> <i>PDF’s</i>).</p>\n<!-------------------->\n<p>Acronyms of the <b class=\"hrv\">HZJZ</b>-type are understood as masculine inanimate and get normal case endings. Ones ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-A</b> (such as <b class=\"hrv\">JNA</b>) are understood as feminine, don’t get any endings, and you can’t derive possessive adjectives.</p>\n<p>Finally, acronyms like <b class=\"hrv\">BBC</b> often end (in pronunciation) in <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>, so any case (and possessive) endings will have inserted <b class=\"hrv\">-j-</b> (recall <b class=\"hrv\">taksi</b>, DL <b class=\"hrv\">taksi<b class=\"hrvc\">j</b>u</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">Toni</b>, DL <b class=\"hrv\">Toni<b class=\"hrvc\">j</b>u</b>), and you’ll see:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">na <span class=\"hc-dl\">BBC-<b class=\"hrvc\">j</b>u</span></b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">na</b> <b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>i</u>ju</b>) <i>on BBC</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">BBC-<b class=\"hrvc\">j</b>eva serija</b> (pron. <b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>i</u>jeva</b>) <i>BBC series</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>However, you’ll also see spellings without <b class=\"hrv\">-j-</b>, i.e. <b class=\"hrv\">na BBC-u</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">BBC-ev</b>!</p>\n<p>This sums up behavior of various types of acronyms in real life in Croatia:</p>\n<div class=\"hscr\"><table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">type</th>\n<th>gender</th>\n<th>cases</th>\n<th class=\"last\">possessive</th>\n</tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">MUP</b>\n</td><td>masc. inan.\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">MUP-a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">MUP-ov</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">FIFA</b>\n</td><td>feminine\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">Fife</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">FIFA-e</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">Fifin</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">FIFA-in</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrvc\">UNESCO</b>\n</td><td>masc. inan.\n</td><td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\"><em>all you can imagine</em>\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">HRT</b>\n</td><td rowspan=\"2\">masc. inan.\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">HRT-a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">HRT-ov</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">NK</b> /-<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>a</u></b>/\n</td><td><b class=\"hrvc\">NK</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">NK-a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">NK-ov</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrvc\">RH</b>\n</td><td>mostly fem.\n</td><td><b class=\"hrvc\">RH</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">—\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">HZJZ</b>\n</td><td>masc. inan.\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">HZJZ-a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">HZJZ-ov</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrvc\">JNA</b>\n</td><td>feminine\n</td><td><b class=\"hrvc\">JNA</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">—\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">BBC</b> /-<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>i</u></b>/\n</td><td rowspan=\"2\">masc. inan.\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">BBC-a</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">BBC-<b class=\"hrvc\">j</b>a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">BBC-<b class=\"hrvc\">j</b>ev</b><br/><b class=\"hrv\">BBC-ev</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">CNN</b>\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">CNN-a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">CNN-ov</b>\n</td></tr></table></div>\n<p>When they are several ways in real life, I’ve listed the most common option (which is frequently not considered ‘correct’ by style guides!) first.</p>\n<!-------------------->\n<p>Some final remarks: you’ll maybe hear in some movies, from some older people <b class=\"hrv\">SFRJ</b> pronounced /<b class=\"hrv\">es</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">ef</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">er</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">j<u>o</u>t</b>/. This was common in the past, but it seems that way has died out.</p>\n<p>Also, some younger people might pronounce acronyms such as <b class=\"hrv\">CIA</b> in the borrowed way, which is very likely an influence of TV series, movies and video games. Keep in mind there might be some variation in terms related to technology and anything US-related, where some speakers might pick up pronunciation from YouTube™, movies etc.</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"95-reg\">\n<p>® There’s actually one more way to say <i>from UEFA</i>: <b class=\"hrv\">iz UEFA</b>, i.e. not changing the acronym at all, both in speech and writing. This is quite rare in Croatia, but it completely dominates in Serbia! It’s also the most common way in Bosnia, but <b class=\"hrv\">iz UEFA-e</b> is used there as well (the same holds for Montenegro). Just check the statistics on the .rs (Serbia) and .ba (Bosnia) Internet domains, and compare them with the Croatian one:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first\"></th><th>    .hr</th><th>    .ba</th><th class=\"last\">    .rs</th></tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz Uefe</b></td><td class=\"rgh\">17500</td><td class=\"rgh\">1900</td><td class=\"last rgh\">2000</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz UEFA-e</b></td><td class=\"rgh\">8600</td><td class=\"rgh\">10000</td><td class=\"last rgh\">800</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">iz UEFA</b></td><td class=\"rgh\">1000</td><td class=\"rgh\">23000</td><td class=\"last rgh\">17000</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>When you check Serbian examples of <b class=\"hrv\">iz UEFA-e</b>, many look like copied from Croatian newspapers and web sites.</p>\n</div><!-- reg-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_95\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_95_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_95\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>Of course, Latin didn’t have the letter V as well, but somehow there’s no variation in producing that letter in the Latin-based way in Croatian, it’s always <b class=\"hrv\">ve</b>. Listing both <b class=\"hrv\">U</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">V</b> in the table of pronunciations inherited from Latin was cheating a bit from my side.</p>\n<p>Latin names of letters were the source of English names as well. The letter B is actually pronounced <i>bee</i>, G is <i>gee</i>, while K is pronouced similarly to A. From the spellings you can see the older pronounciation was similar to Croatian and Latin. The English pronunciation has changed during the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift\">Great Vowel Shift</a>, in the similar way as the word for a <i>bee</i>, the word <i>see</i> and many others.</p>\n<p>You can see spellings like <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO-v</b> on university web sites, in printed media, and so on. There’s really no reason why anyone should insist on <b class=\"hrv\">UNESCO-ov</b>, but some people like to insist.</p>\n<p>The pronunciation of <b class=\"hrv\">BBC</b> as <b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">bi</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>i</u></b> is so well established in Croatia, that the orthography manual by the <i>Institute of Croatian Language</i> takes it for granted and just notes that <b class=\"hrv\">-j-</b> must be inserted before any endings (which is often done, but not always).</p>\n<p>BBC has been very influential in Croatia for many decades. In the first years of Croatian TV, in 1950’s, most shows were imported from BBC. Various shows produced by BBC, such as many documentaries, were quite popular, and some comedies, such as <em><a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a></em>, had huge popularity in Croatia.

      "title": "EC: 98 Improvisations and Fancifications",
      "html": "\n<p>This is one of \"extra\" chapters: things you don’t really need to speak Croatian, but it could help you understand some features in spoken and written Croatian as it is.</p>\n<p>Croatia is not a remote island, it has been open to influences from other cultures for a very long time. While influences before the 1950’s are best described in the history of the language – a chapter that’s still under construction – everyhing in the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century is still an ongoing process. Still, I’ll touch briefly here the period in the first half of the 20th century as well.</p>\n<p>When you are in contact with other countries and cultures, there’s an exchange of people, things and ideas. Since Croatia is small in absolute terms, and undeveloped in relation to the countries to the west and north of it, that exchange was mainly exporting people and importing things and ideas. Most things were invented elsewhere and simply imported into Croatian lands, and along these things, words from them. Some of the obvious examples from the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century are words like:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">auto</b> m <i>car</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#98-auto\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">d<u>i</u>z<u>a</u>jn</b> <i>design</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">film</b> <i>movie</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kino</b> <i>movie theater</i><br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">špag<u>e</u>ti</b> m pl. <i>spaghetti</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tenis</b> <i>tennis</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vikend</b> <i>weekend</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zebra</b> <i>zebra</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The sources were German and English, but also other languages: <b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>i</u>l<u>e</u>t</b> (») <i>razor</i> was borrowed from the American brand name <i>Gillette</i>, but pronounced in the French way (as in many others languages in Europe).</p>\n<p>Words for some inventions were taken from more than one source, the chief example is the word for <i>sport</i>. It has been taken both from English and from German. The problem was that Germans have adapted the word to the German pronuciation rules, where you basically can’t start words with <em>sp-</em>. So there were two versions of the word in the 20th century:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">šport</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sport</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The version with <b class=\"hrv\">š-</b> completely dominated in the 1st half of the 20th century, while the version with <b class=\"hrv\">s-</b> dominated in the second; since the late 20th century, there has been a bit of a comeback of the version <b class=\"hrv\">šport</b>, but the version with <b class=\"hrv\">s-</b> is more common today. This is what Google™ says, in <em>millions</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">šport</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">1\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">sport</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">68\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>You will, occassionally, see the alternative version. (Historically, there were more such pairs, such as <b class=\"hrv\">št<u>u</u>d<u>e</u>nt</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">st<u>u</u>d<u>e</u>nt</b>, but there the versions without <b class=\"hrv\">š-</b> have prevailed long ago.)</p>\n<p>Since 1950’s, with the rise of modern media – from TV to Facebook – there has been a large influx of new things and behaviors from US and UK. And with these new words, there was a question: should they be respelled according to the pronunciation, or left in their original (i.e. English) spelling?</p>\n<p>Various style manuals repeat that such words should be respelled if they have ‘established’ in Croatia and don’t feel \"foreign’ anymore. But what does it actually mean? How do you know when something doesn’t ‘feel’ foreign anymore?</p>\n<p>Five styles of music are nice examples: <i>jazz</i>, <i>rock</i>, <i>blues</i>, <i>dance</i> and <i>pop</i>. The first three terms originated in the US, while the last two have a less straightforward history. The first term has been present in Croatia for more than a century, the second one for more than 6 decades, so you would expect they are well ‘established’, but Google™ again says, on the Croatian Internet domain, in thousands:</p>\n<table class=\"margins\"><tr><td>\n<table class=\"nice nomargins\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">jazz</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">2850</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">džez</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">9</td>\n</tr></table>\n</td><td class=\"spaced\">\n<table class=\"nice nomargins\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">rock</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">5820</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">rok</b></td><td class=\"last rgh\">13</td>\n</tr></table>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>You can see the same for the other terms: the spelling <b class=\"hrv\">blues</b> is some 60 times more common than <b class=\"hrv\">bluz</b>, and so on. With the word <b class=\"hrv\">pop</b>, there was no adaptation – the word was pronouced like a native word from day one.</p>\n<p>There are more words that usually appear in the original spelling, despite some being used for decades:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">jeans</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">džins</b> (7000 x)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">show</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">šou</b> (20 x)<br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(In parentheses: how many times the original spelling is more common.)</p>\n<p>Now, you might ask me a very hard question: why was the word for <i>weekend</i> adapted completely to the Croatian spelling, while the words for music styles, like <i>jazz</i> and <i>rock</i>, or the word <i>show</i> weren’t? I can only speculate, and three reasons come to my mind. First, it could be that only few people write about <i>jazz</i> and <i>rock</i>, and there are specialized magazines for them, while what will be going on over the next <i>weekend</i>, the weather forecast for the <i>weekend</i> is of a much wider interest. Second, it could be an influence of something very popular: there was a popular magazine <b class=\"hrv\">Vikend</b>, focusing on singers, actors, movies, free time, and its name could have influenced spelling a lot.</p>\n<p>There’s one more possibility – that the word for <i>weekend</i> was not borrowed from English at all, but from Czech, where it’s spelled <b class=\"hrv\">víkend</b>. If you’re puzzled how Croatian could have borrowed a word from Czech, actually Czech had a huge influence on Croatian, and besides a lot of words, Croatian has borrowed, in the 19th century, the letters <b class=\"hrv\">č</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">š</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">ž</b> from Czechs, who invented them in the Middle Ages. (Again, these are just my ideas why some spellings are adapted and others aren’t – we really don’t know.)</p>\n<p>With more recent words, the original spelling prevails for sure, and the Croatian spelling is used sporadically:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">cheeseburger</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">čizburger</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gin</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">džin</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">steak</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">stejk</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>With some words, often related to food, you see both spellings used:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">kečap</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">ketchup</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kivi</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">kivij-</b>) / <b class=\"hrv\">kiwi</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">kiwij-</b>) <i>kiwi fruit</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Finally, there are some words where the Croatian spelling completely prevails, such as:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">int<u>e</u>rvj<u>u</u></b> (») / <b class=\"hrv\">interview</b> (66 x)<br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">int<u>e</u>rvj<u>u</u></b> (») is end-stressed (in the ‘western’ scheme) and like <b class=\"hrv\">kan<u>u</u></b>, the <b class=\"hrv\">-u</b> is never removed, so you’ll see <b class=\"hrv\">u intervj<u>u</u>u</b>; each <b class=\"hrv\">-u-</b> is a separate syllable, i.e. <b class=\"hrv\">in-ter-vj<u>u</u>-u</b>.</p>\n<p>All examples so far were <em>nouns</em>. With verbs, adjectives and adverbs, the situation is a bit different.</p>\n<p>Verbs have to be adapted somehow, because verbs have specific endings for the infinitive and other forms; for over a century, the main way to adapt foreign verbs was to simply add <b class=\"hrv\">-ati</b> and make a perfectly regular verb. Some examples are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">bildati</b> <i>bodybuild</i> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#98-reg\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">štrajkati</b> <i>strike</i> (as a union of workers) <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#98-reg\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The first verb illustrates an important fact: while (according to Wikipedia) the English verb <i>strike</i> has 18 currently used meanings, it has been borowed into Croatian in only one, <em>specialized</em> meaning. Actually, the word <i>strike</i> was first borrowed into <em>German</em> in the specialized meaning; from there, the noun <b class=\"hrv\">štrajk</b> was borrowed into Croatia, and finally, a verb was created from it. The other verb was borrowed only in a specialized meaning too.</p>\n<p>Another way to adapt verbs, a bit less common, is to add <b class=\"hrv\">-<u>i</u>rati</b> («); the verb gets a stress shift in the present tense in the standard scheme. Some examples are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">čip<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>tag</i> (an animal)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sken<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>scan</i> (using a scanner)<br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>There are many verbs in this group that have been taken from German, such as <b class=\"hrv\">park<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>park</i> (a car).</p>\n<p>As you can see, spelling of verbs which have been used for decades is always adapted.</p>\n<p>With adjectives, they are usually simply taken over and at first become indeclinable (i.e. have only one form); their spelling is usually adapted, for example (in thousands):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">fer</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">4100\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">fair</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">136\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Examples showing how this adjective never gets any endings are phrases like <b class=\"hrv\">fer c<s>i</s>jena</b> <i>fair price</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">fer uvjeti</b> <i>fair conditions</i>. More such adjectives are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>e</u>kspr<u>e</u>s</b> <br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>i</u>nst<u>a</u>nt</b> <br/>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mini</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">seksi</b><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>These adjectives are more naturalized and respelled as often (or more) than written in the original way. Also, they don’t have comparative or superlative forms, but they can have ‘too much’ forms (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">preseksi</b> <i>too sexy</i>).</p>\n<p>Gradually, if an adjective is frequently used, it has a chance to become completely naturalized and behave like any long-established adjective – endings and all. This happened, in speech, to the formerly indeclinable adjective <b class=\"hrv\">roza</b> <i>pink</i>, which became <b class=\"hrv\">rozi</b> and now behaves like any regular adjective. Interestingly, some style manuals and web pages oppose such use, because dictionaries list only the indeclinable form! Apparently, some people never understood languages change over decades and centuries. (This is, actually, a sign that the language is still strong and can impose native patterns on foreign words and absorb them completely.)<p>\n<p>The adjective <b class=\"hrv\">rozi</b> is sometimes transformed into comparative (<b class=\"hrv\">roziji</b>) or superlative.</p>\n<p>Now we come to how people <em>improvise</em> when they learn about something new in English, but can’t figure what the corresponding Croatian word would be – maybe there isn’t any with that <em>precise</em> meaning, it’s not clear if there’s a suitable metaphor. Then they <em>simply take the English word</em>. Nouns are usually spelled like in English, but get normal endings, like in this example (I’ve taken it from the Internet, this a statement by a government official):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ista</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> osoba</span> ne smije u <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">drive-inu</b> naplać<u>i</u>vati i posluž<u>i</u>vati <span class=\"hc-a\">hranu</span>.</b><br/>\n<i>The same person in a drive-in should not take money and serve food.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>(This is not a very precise translation, as <b class=\"hrv\">naplać<u>i</u>vati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">napl<u>a</u>titi</b> means giving a receipt for goods or services – <em>possibly provided by someone else</em> – and getting them paid by either cash, cards or some other way of payment. Maybe there’s an exact English translation, but I can’t guess it.)</p>\n<p>Another example is <b class=\"hrv\">piercing</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">pirsing</b> (the original spelling is 12 times more common).<p>\n<p>Adjectives and adverbs are treated in the same way. Adjectives become indeclinable; for example (again from the Internet):</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">U <span class=\"hc-dl\">Os<s>i</s>jeku</span> se sprema <span class=\"hc-n\">prvi</span><span class=\"hc-n\"> veliki</span><b class=\"hrvc hc-n\"> stand-up</b><span class=\"hc-n\"> spekt<u>a</u>kl</span></b>\n<i>The first great stand-up show is getting ready in Osijek</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">spekt<u>a</u>kl</b> means something bigger than a mere <i>show</i>; it’s something <em>spectacular</em> but one more time it’s hard for me to find the right English word! Often there are no exact equivalents in other languages.</p>\n<p class=\"att\">People simply take words from other languages because life is too short, dictionaries lack many words, and sometimes there are no exact or established translations for some terms at all. Sometimes, the only realistic option is to <em>improvise</em> and just leave the word essentially untranslated. An example is <i>show</i>: the corresponding Croatian word hasn’t been invented so far.</p>\n<p>(Also, note how we actually have a <i>big spectacle</i> in the example above, not an ordinary <i>spectacle</i>. This is because some words wear down, don’t draw attention anymore, and people have to invent new ways of drawing attention, sometimes using words like <i>awesome</i>, but also by taking words from other languages.)</p>\n<p>Verbs are borrowed because there’s a lack of metaphor, or people aren’t sure which existing verb can be reused in the new meaning. One example is <i>saving a file</i> on a computer (or mobile phone), and other verbs related to technology:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">guglati</b> <i>search</i> (using Google™)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">printati</b> <i>print</i> (from a computer)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sejvati</b> <i>save</i> (a file)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zipati</b> <i>compress</i> (‘<i>zip</i>’ a file)<br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Gradually, native verbs are being used more and more to express this meaning, so today <b class=\"hrv\">spremati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">spremiti</b> <i>prepare, tidy, store</i> is also used to express the first meaning (for more about this verb pair, check 86 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"86.html\">More Verbs and Standing Outcomes</a>).</p>\n<p>Verbs are adapted by adding <b class=\"hrv\">-ati</b> and, when written, sometimes respelled according to how Croatians <em>think</em> they should pronounce the word, but with verbs related to technology and special areas, the original spelling prevails:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\">\n<i>update</i> (software)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">apd<u>e</u>jtati</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">800\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">upd<u>ea</u>tati</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">2600\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\">\n<i>download</i> (a file)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">daunlodati</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">135\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">downloadati</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">12000\n</td></tr></table>\n<!-- trolati, tvitati -->\n<p>This could look like a weird hybrid, but standard Croatian spelling requires original spelling of personal names, even when getting Croatian endings (recall <b class=\"hrv\">Shakespeareov</b>, introduced way back in 19 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"19.html\">Your, Ana’s: Possessives</a>) so mixed spellings aren’t that unusual.</p>\n<p>The verb <b class=\"hrv\">downloadati</b> is also becoming less common, and it’s mostly used by specialists, as most people have repurposed this native verb pair for the new meaning:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">skidati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">skinuti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">skine</b>) <i>take off</i>\n</p>\n<p>This pair has been usually used to express <i>taking down</i> what was ‘<i>on</i>’ – either clothes someone is wearing or some box from a top shelf – but today it also expresses ‘<i>taking down</i>’ files and applications from the Internet. Interestingly, the ‘official’ Croatian verb pair to express <i>download</i> is actually <b class=\"hrv\">pre<u>u</u>z<u>i</u>mati</b> ~ <b class=\"hrv\">pre<u>u</u>zeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pr<u>e</u><u>u</u>zme</b>) <i>take over</i>, but this is very rare in speech and casual writing.</p>\n<p>Verbs related to everyday life or common interests are usually respelled:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\">\n<i>like</i><br/>(on a social network)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">lajkati</b> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#98-reg\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">51000\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">likeati</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">200\n</td></tr><tr class=\"separ\"><td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\">\n<i>fake</i><br/>(make a false display)\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">fejkati</b> <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"#98-reg\" title=\"Click for regional differences\">®</a>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">6000\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">fakeati</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">10\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>These two verbs illustrate that people, when they can’t find an <em>exact</em> equivalent in Croatian, simply borrow the English verb and adapt it. However, the result is not some mixed English-Croatian language, as Croatian grammar, endings, word order is always observed. It sometimes leads to sentences and texts with a lot of English words (check the Examples below).</p>\n<p>You can also use English words because they are <em>cool</em>: an English word can draw attention, make something more interesting, and so on. This is how some adjectives and adverbs are taken, for example <i>cool</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">cool</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">kul</b>), <i>full</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">full</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">ful</b>) and <i>actually</i> (also <b class=\"hrv\">ekšuli</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">ekšli</b>); here’s an example from the Internet:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">ekšli</b> je pričala s <span class=\"hc-i\">ljudima</span> iz <span class=\"hc-g\">prvih</span><span class=\"hc-g\"> redova</span></b>\n<i>she actually talked to people from the front rows</i> (lit. ‘<i>first rows</i>’) \n</p></div>\n<p>(Recall that the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">prvi</b> is sometimes used when English would use <i>front</i>, in e.g. <i>front line</i> or <i>front row</i>.)</p>\n<p>The word <b class=\"hrv\">cool</b> is the most used of these: it’s used by schools and even govermnent to promote projects for kids; for example, there’s a project called <b class=\"hrv\">knjiga je cool</b> <i>a book is cool</i>, promoting reading books in elementary schools.</p>\n<p>For such words, both spellings are used, but the English one still dominates (in thousands):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">cool</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">4100\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">kul</b>\n</td><td class=\"last rgh\">503\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Finally, many people got an idea to make <em>Croatian words</em> fancier by using English-like spellings: we can call it \"fancification\". Just a few examples are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">Beertija</b> after <b class=\"hrv\">b<u>i</u>rt<u>i</u>ja</b> <i>tavern</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Kooglana</b> after <b class=\"hrv\">kugl<u>a</u>na</b> <i>bowling alley</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(For more examples, check the Examples section below.)</p>\n<p>Of course, you can simply use English names; for example, the two main shopping malls in Zagreb are named <em>City Center One</em>. However, this is just full, plain English; a fancy Croatian-English mix seems to be more cool.</p>\n<!-- knjižnica, knižnica --->\n<p>I’ve explained almost everything you need to know – the next chapter, the last one, is about certain things you don’t really need to know!</p>\n<p>________</p>\n<p class=\"reg\" id=\"98-auto\">® In southern parts of Croatia (i.e. in Dalmatia) and parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, <b class=\"hrv\">auto</b> <i>car</i> is very often neuter in colloquial speech, so you’ll sometimes read and hear <b class=\"hrv\">novo auto</b>.</p>\n<div class=\"reg\" id=\"98-reg\">\n<p>Many verbs adapted with <b class=\"hrv\">-ati</b> in Croatia get a different suffix in Serbia:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">štrajkovati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">štrajkuje</b>) <i>strike</i> (as a union of workers)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bildovati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">bilduje</b>) <i>bodybuild</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">lajkovati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">lajkuje</b>) <i>like</i> (on a social network)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">fejkovati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">fejkuje</b>) <i>fake</i> (make a false display)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zipati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">zipuje</b>) <i>compress</i> (a file)<br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>This is one instance where the spontaneous evolution of language in Croatia and Serbia follows different paths.</p>\n</div><!-- reg-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"spi_98\", \"Something Possibly Interesting\")'>\n<span id=\"spi_98_ctrl\">↓ Something Possibly Interesting (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"spi_98\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>Variants <b class=\"hrv\">šport</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">sport</b> even became a political question at the turn of the 21st century: left-leaning newspapers preferred the English version, while the right-leaning ones preferred the German one. Spellings used on Public TV changed as various parties came into power. Eventually, the issue has deflated and it’s almost forgotten today.</p>\n<p>Sadly, there’s no dictionary listing when each Croatian word has appeared for first time in writing. Internet search shows that <b class=\"hrv\">vikend</b> appears from 1930’s. But for many other words, this is simply not known. Some linguists and historians combed old letters and books for words they found interesting, but there’s no comprehensive reference.</p>\n<p>As a result, you’ll encounter are some dubious claims, for example that the Croatian linguist, poet and statesman <b>Ivan Maž<u>u</u>ranić</b> ‘invented’ the word <b class=\"hrv\">sladoled</b> (meaning <i>ice-cream</i>) because the first dictionary which lists this word is one he co-authored in 1842 (athough <b>Maž<u>u</u>ranić</b> never claimed he had invented the word). However, a Croatian linguist <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaZ38RaQF8A\">recently found</a> an earlier example of <b class=\"hrv\">sladoled</b> in an newspaper ad – using a newspaper archive available on the Internet. So we now know that the word was <em>likely</em> invented by <em>someone</em> in 1830’s.</p>\n<p>Because the original spellings sometimes make no sense in Croatian, you’ll also see spellings such as <b class=\"hrv\">cheseburger</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">kechup</b> used in Croatia.</p>\n<p>The ending <b class=\"hrv\">-<u>i</u>rati</b>, now very common in Croatian, is an outcome of improvisations in late 1600's: it comes from German verbs ending in <em>-ieren</em>. However, that <em>-ier-</em> is not a native German suffix: it has been borrowed from French, and ultimately comes from the Latin infinitive ending <em>-ire</em> (there the <em>-i-</em> is actually a wovel that belongs to the verb, a parallel would be Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">-iti</b>). Therefore, in verbs like <b class=\"hrv\">živc<u>i</u>rati</b> («) <i>irritate</i>, we have, <em>historically</em>, a Latin infinitive ending, followed by the Croatian infinitive ending.</p>\n<p>Both words shown in fancy respellings, <b class=\"hrv\">b<u>i</u>rt<u>i</u>ja</b> <i>tavern</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">kugl<u>a</u>na</b> <i>bowling alley</i> are actually based on German words. It’s meaningless to discuss if some word is a ‘true Croatian’ word or not!</p>\n<p>Some people are afraid that Croatian will be gradually replaced by English. While it’s possible for sure in a very long run, examples such as repurposing a native verb pair to express <i>download</i> show that many improvised verbs will become obsolete. Also, even with verbs that will remain, they are pronounced as native verbs, get native endings and so on.</p>\n</div><!--SPI-->\n<!--##EXAMPLE##-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"example_98\", \"Examples\")'>\n<span id=\"example_98_ctrl\">↓ Examples (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"example_98\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>This changing booth on a beach on the Croatian coast advertises a mobile phone application which offers some discounts in the <b class=\"hrv\">Plodine</b> supermarket chain.

      "html": "\n<!-- spans fixed -->\n<p>There are features in Croatian that you will see used from time to time. You <em>don't</em> need them in everyday life, but some people use them, and you'll see them in literature (but they are rare even in books).</p>\n<p>First, there are several rarely used verb tenses.</p>\n<p>The <em>aorist tense</em> is traditionally a past tense, but today it’s usually used for events that have happened moments ago, or are about to happen right now. It’s usually formed for perfective verbs, but it can be used with impf. verbs as well.</p>\n<p>The aorist tense is a single word, usually formed from the infinitive. For verbs ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-ti</b>, the ending is replaced with the following personal endings:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">person</th>\n<th>sing.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">plur.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">1st</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-h</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-smo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">2nd</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-ste</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">3rd</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-še</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>I’ll use abbreviations like <em>aor-1</em>, <em>aor-3pl</em> for various aorist forms, in the same way as for the present tense forms. Here are forms for several verbs (<em>pres-3</em> and <em>past</em> forms are not shown, as they're not important for forming the aorist if verbs have <b class=\"hrv\">-ti</b> in <em>inf</em>):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">na<u>u</u>či<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b>\nperf. <i>learn</i> →\n<em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\">na<u>u</u>či<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pozva<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b>\nperf. <i>call, invite</i> →\n<em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\">pozva<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">uze<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b>\nperf. <i>take</i> →\n<em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\">uze<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vidje<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b>\n<i>see</i> →\n<em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\">vidje<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b>\n</p>\n<p>Observe that it's not important if the verb is ‘regular’ or not: only the <em>inf</em> ending matters.</p>\n<p>For 2nd and 3rd person in singular, the ending is ‘empty’, so we get <b class=\"hrv\">na<u>u</u>či</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">uze</b>.</p>\n<p>Verbs with <em>inf</em> ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-sti</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">-ći</b> insert a vowel before the aorist endings, <b class=\"hrv\">-o-</b> in <em>aor-1</em> and plural, and <b class=\"hrv\">-e-</b> in <em>aor-23</em> (the form common to the 2nd and 3rd person):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">person</th>\n<th>sing.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">plur.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">1st</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-oh</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-osmo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">2nd</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-oste</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">3rd</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-oše</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For such verbs, aorist forms aren't derived from <em>inf</em>. If they have <em>past-m</em> in <b class=\"hrv\">-ao</b>, it’s removed, and aorist forms are derived from it; otherwise, they are derived from <em>pres-3</em>, after discarding the final vowel (which is always <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b> for such verbs):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poje<b class=\"hrvc\">sti</b></b> (<b class=\"hrv\">poj<u>e</u>de</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">poje<b class=\"hrvc\">o</b></b>)\nperf. <i>eat</i> →\n<em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\">poj<u>e</u>d<b class=\"hrvc\">oh</b></b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">ći</b></b> (<b class=\"hrv\">reče</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">rek<b class=\"hrvc\">ao</b></b>, <b class=\"hrv\">rekla</b>)\nperf. <i>say</i> →\n<em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\">rek<b class=\"hrvc\">oh</b></b>\n</p>\n<p>Verbs on <b class=\"hrv\">-ći</b> that have <em>past-m</em> in <b class=\"hrv\">-kao</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-gao</b> shift the final consonant in <em>aor-23</em> to the consonant used in <em>pres-3</em>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b>oh</b> (<em>past-m</em> <b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">k</b>ao</b>)<br/>\n<em>aor-23</em> <b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">če</b></b> (<em>pres-3</em> <b class=\"hrv\">re<b class=\"hrvc\">č</b>e</b>)<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Verbs derived from <b class=\"hrv\">ići</b> don't fit into this scheme: their aorist forms are always derived from <em>pres-3</em> (but they're quite irregular anyway):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">naći</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">nađ</b>e</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">našao</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">našla</b>) perf. <i>find</i>\n→ <em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">nađ</b>oh</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>ći</b> (<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">od</b>e</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>šao</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>t<u>i</u>šla</b>) perf. <i>leave</i>\n→ <em>aor-1</em> <b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">od</b>oh</b>\n</p>\n<p>The aorist forms are normally stressed like forms they’re derived from: if they are derived from <em>inf</em>, on the same syllable as <em>inf</em>; if from <em>pres-3</em>, like it, etc.</p>\n<p>However, in the standard stress scheme, <em>aor-23</em> is <em>always stressed on the first syllable</em>, regardless of stress of other forms:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<em>aor-1</em>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poj<u>e</u>doh</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<em>aor-23</em>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>o</u></b>j<u>e</u>de</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<em>aor-1pl</em>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">poj<u>e</u>dosmo</b>\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">\n...\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The use of aorist is very rare in western parts of Croatia; in more eastern regions, it can be heard in storytelling and expressing immediate action, especially in smalltowns and villages, e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><span class=\"hc-n\">Ja</span> <b class=\"hrvc\">odoh</b>.</b> <i>I’m leaving now.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>Note that, unlike the common past tense, the aorist tense is independent on the sex of the speaker: this could be a female or male speaking, we don't know.</p>\n<p>Another past form (similar to the <em>plusquamperfect tense</em>) is the <em>past conditional</em>. It’s like conditional, but has an extra <em>past</em> form of the verb <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² +), in the same gender and number as the other <em>past</em> form:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Gledala bih <span class=\"hc-a\">film</span>.</b> <i>I would watch the movie.</i> {f}\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Bila</b> bih gledala <span class=\"hc-a\">film</span>.</b> <i>I would have watched the movie.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This form was used to express intentions and opportunities in the past, but today it’s optional, and almost everybody uses just the common conditional.</p>\n<p>Then, there's yet another past tense: the <em>imperfect tense</em>. As its name says, it’s formed from impf. verbs. It's so rare that I don't recall its endings. I think I've never used it in my life. If you are really want to learn its endings, look into Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>Similar to present adverbs derived from verbs, there are also <em>past adverbs</em>. They correspond to English <i><u>having seen</u> it, she decided to...</i>. They are normally formed from the <em>past-f</em> form of the verb, replacing the final <b class=\"hrv\">-la</b> with <b class=\"hrv\">-vši</b>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<i>see</i> <b class=\"hrv\">vidje<b class=\"hrvc\">la</b></b>\n→ <b class=\"hrv\">vidje<b class=\"hrvc\">vši</b></b><br/>\n<i>eat</i> (perf.) <b class=\"hrv\">poje<b class=\"hrvc\">la</b></b>\n→ <b class=\"hrv\">poje<b class=\"hrvc\">vši</b></b>\n</p>\n<p>For verbs where <em>past-m</em> form has an additional <b class=\"hrv\">-a-</b> in comparison to the <em>past-f</em> form, it's derived from the <em>past-m</em> form, replacing <b class=\"hrv\">-o</b> with <b class=\"hrv\">-vši</b>:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<i>can</i> <b class=\"hrv\">mog<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b>o</b> m, <b class=\"hrv\">mogla</b> f\n→ <b class=\"hrv\">moga<b class=\"hrvc\">vši</b></b><br/>\n<i>grow up</i> (perf.) <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>dr<u>a</u>st<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b>o</b> m, <b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>dr<u>a</u>sla</b> f\n→ <b class=\"hrv\">odr<u>a</u>sta<b class=\"hrvc\">vši</b></b>\n</p>\n<p>They are very rare in speech, and rarely used in writing:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">Vidjevši</b> da neće uspjeti, od<u>u</u>stala je.</b> <i>Having seen she wasn't going to succeed, she gave up.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>This meaning is usually expressed with <b class=\"hrv\">kad</b> <i>when</i> or <b class=\"hrv\">nakon</b> <i>after</i> instead of this rare form.</p>\n<p>However, the past adverb <b class=\"hrv\">bivši</b>, derived from the verb <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² +) <i>be</i> is often used, but it's true adjective, with the meaning <i>former, ex</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vidjela je <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">bivšeg</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> muža</span>.</b> <i>She saw her ex-husband.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>As in English, the adjective <b class=\"hrv\">bivši</b> is used colloquially on its own, meaning <i>ex-husband/boyfriend</i>, or <i>ex-wife/girlfriend</i>, depending on the gender, but it still changes like an adjective.</p>\n<p>There’s an interesting feature that was historically much more common: <em>use of indefinite adjectives</em>. So far, I've explained basically only so-called <em>definite adjectives</em>, which are usually used.</p>\n<p>However, most adjectives also had <em>indefinite</em> forms. The endings in singular are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><th class=\"first\">\ngender\n</th><th class=\"hc-n\">N\n</th><th class=\"hc-a\">A\n</th><th class=\"hc-dl\">DL\n</th><th class=\"hc-g\">G\n</th><th class=\"last hc-i\">I\n</th></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\nneuter\n</td><td><b class=\"hrv\">-o</b><br/>(<b class=\"hrv\">-e</b>)\n</td><td>= N\n</td><td rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrvc\">-u</b>\n</td><td rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrvc\">-a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">-om</b><br/>(<b class=\"hrv\">-em</b>)\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\nmasc.<br/>(not p/a)\n</td><td>dict.\n</td><td>= N\n</td></tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\nmasc.<br/>(p/a)\n</td><td>dict.\n</td><td><b class=\"hrvc\">-a</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>As you can see, these look exactly like the noun endings. In the masc. N. indefinite forms have no <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>, while definite forms have always <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>.</p>\n<p>Standard Croatian still insists on use of indefinite adjectives. They should be used with indefinite nouns, i.e. when you would use the indefinite article in English:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vidim <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">crna</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> konja</span>.</b> <i>A see <u>a</u> black horse.</i> (very rare in use)\n</p></div>\n<p>Actually, these indefinite forms are the forms I’ve explained as predicate forms, and, if you remember, some of them have a different stress. That can distinguish the feminine and neuter forms for some adjectives:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">crvenu</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> jabuku</span>.</b> <i>I have <u>the</u> red apple.</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imam <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">crv<u>e</u>nu</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> jabuku</span>.</b> <i>I have <u>a</u> red apple.</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The actual rule for such adjectives was that indefinite forms have a movable stress, which moves right (in the standard scheme) whenever you add any ending:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>definite</th>\n<th class=\"last\">indefinite</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>deep</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">duboki</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">d<u>u</u>bok</b> (»)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>green</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">zeleni</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">z<u>e</u>len</b> (»)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>This explains why the feminine and neuter forms of such adjectives, when used as predicates, have stress on a different syllable than masc. forms.</p>\n<p>This also has consequences when adding <b class=\"hrv\">pre-</b>: <b class=\"hrv\">preduboka</b> is the definite form (the stress moves to prefix since no vowel is underlined), while <b class=\"hrv\">predub<u>o</u>ka</b> is the indefinite form (the stress stays on the underlined vowel).</p>\n<p>Then, some adjectives, according to Standard Croatian, have <em>only</em> indefinite forms, regardless of definiteness, and that includes all possessives in <b class=\"hrv\">-ov</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ev</b>, including <b class=\"hrv\">njegov</b> <i>his</i>:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vidim <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">njegova</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> brata</span>.</b> <i>I see his brother.</i> (Standard, but very rare)\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Vidim <b class=\"hrvc hc-a\">njegovog</b><span class=\"hc-a\"> brata</span>.</b> (this is almost always used)\n</p></div>\n<p>But some adjectives are even more complicated: their stress behaves diffently in various genders, and so on. I have to admit, I don’t even know the details.</p>\n<p><p>Use of indefinite adjectives, except as predicates, is rare in real life. However, you’ll see forms like above in some newspapers, on TV news, and in poetry, and you can hear them in smaller towns and villages in more eastern parts of Croatia, and in parts of inland Dalmatia.</p>\n<p>Then, Standard Croatian insists that numbers 2-4 change according to case. You will sometimes see in writing DLI forms for numbers 2 and <i>both</i> in <em>feminine</em> gender and for 3:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">number</th>\n<th class=\"last\">DLI</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">obje</b> f <i>both</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">obj<u>e</u>ma</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">dvije</b> f <i>two</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">dv<b class=\"hrv\">je</b>ma</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">tri</b> <i>three</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">trima</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>If numbers change, nouns also change, into DLI-<em>pl</em>. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Posjet <b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\">dvjema</b><b class=\"hrvc hc-dl\"> farmama</b></b> <i>A visit to two farms</i> (rare)\n</p></div>\n<p>(If you check Google™, <b class=\"hrv\">u dvije</b> is about 30 times more frequent than <b class=\"hrv\">u dvjema</b>.) Other forms – including masc. gender – exist in grammar books, but are very rare in use. You will sometimes see the forms above used for G as well.</p>\n<!--##EXAMPLE##-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"example_99\", \"Examples\")'>\n<span id=\"example_99_ctrl\">↓ Examples (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"example_99\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p><b class=\"hrv\">Mate Kovač</b>, best known under his nickname <b class=\"hrv\">Mišo Kovač</b>, is a Croatian pop singer who was immensely popular in 1970’s and 80’s, selling hundreds of thousands of records.

However, in early Latin grammars, ‘nouns’ included adjectives too. Since most grammarians are incredibly conservative, most grammars of other Europeaan languages followed that tradition.</p>\n<p>This meant the word <i>his</i>, standing for e.g. <i>John’s</i>, was a ‘pronoun’, but the word <i>here</i>, standing for e.g. <i>in my room</i> wasn’t a ‘pronoun’, but an ‘adverb’.</p>\n<p>Since the 19th century, first in Latin grammars, some grammarians have recognized there is a better way to describe such words, and started grouping many other words with pronouns. This summary follows such an approach.</p>\n<h2>Personal pronouns</h2>\n<p><em>Personal pronouns</em> are a special group of words that come in two forms: <em>stressed</em> (or long) and <em>unstressed</em> (or short):</p>\n<div class=\"hscr\"><table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n</tr><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\"></th>\n<th rowspan=\"13\"> </th>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"5\">                        stressed</th>\n<th rowspan=\"13\"> </th>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"3\">      unstressed</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\">person</th>\n<th class=\"first hc-n\">N</th>\n<th class=\"hc-a\"> A</th>\n<th class=\"hc-g\"> G</th>\n<th class=\"hc-dl\"> DL</th>\n<th class=\"last hc-i\"> I</th>\n<th class=\"first hc-a\"> A</th>\n<th class=\"hc-g\"> G</th>\n<th class=\"last hc-dl\">DL</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\">1 <em>sg</em></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ja</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">mene</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">mene</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">meni</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">mnom</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">me</b>²</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">me</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">mi</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\">2 <em>sg</em></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ti</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tebe</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tebe</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tebi</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">tobom</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">te</b>²</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">te</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">ti</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first last\">3 <em>sg</em> m</td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">on</b></td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">njega</b></td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">njega</b></td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">njemu</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">njim</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">ga</b>²</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">ga</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">mu</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\">3 <em>sg</em> n</td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ono</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\">3 <em>sg</em> f</td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ona</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrvc\">nju</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrvc\">nje</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">njoj</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">njom</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>² / <b class=\"hrvc\">ju</b>²</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">joj</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first last\"><i>self</i></td>\n<td class=\"first\">—</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">sebe</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">sebe</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">sebi</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">sobom</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">si</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first last\">1 <em>pl</em></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">mi</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nas</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nas</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">        <b class=\"hrv\">nama</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">nas</b>²</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nas</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">nam</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\">2 <em>pl</em></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">vi</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vas</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vas</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">        <b class=\"hrv\">vama</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">vas</b>²</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vas</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vam</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first last\">3 <em>pl</em> m</td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">oni</b></td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">njih</b></td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">njih</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\">        <b class=\"hrv\">njima</b></td>\n<td class=\"first\" rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">ih</b>²</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">ih</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">im</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\">3 <em>pl</em> n</td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ona</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first last\">3 <em>pl</em> f</td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">one</b></td>\n</tr></table></div>\n<p>For almost all pronouns, G and A have the same form.</p>\n<p>The choice of <b class=\"hrv\">ju</b>² vs <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>² (3rd pers. fem.

In some regions, <b class=\"hrv\">ju</b>² is almost always used.</p>\n<p>In standard Croatian, <b class=\"hrv\">ju</b>² is used only if the preceding word ends in <b class=\"hrv\">-je</b>, or the next word is the 3rd person verb <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>²  e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">ni<b class=\"hrvc\">je ju</b> vidio</b> <i>he didn’t see her</i>. Otherwise, standard Croatian requires using <b class=\"hrv\">je</b>². (Some manuals don’t agree in details, and this rule is disputed.)</p>\n<p>These rules, however, are often not followed in writing, where both forms are often used more freely.</p>\n<p>Unstressed pronouns should be placed in the second position in a clause, as marked with ² (for more information, check A5 <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"a5.html\">Word Order</a>). Stressed pronouns are used when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we want to specially emphasize something\n<li>when using a preposition before a pronoun\n<li>when using <b class=\"hrv&gt;\">i</b> either before or after the pronoun\n<li>when using <b class=\"hrv&gt;\">a</b> to contrast two clauses\n<li>in short responses\n<li>when there’s no required short pronoun in the desired case\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>This applies to nominative forms too: they are used only when stressed pronouns should be used, otherwise, they are omitted.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you’ll see just <b class=\"hrv\">nj</b> instead of <b class=\"hrv\">njega</b>; it’s used only after prepositions.</p>\n<h2>Possessive pronouns</h2>\n<p><em>Possessive pronouns</em> are basically adjectives, but some of them have special forms:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">pers.</th>\n<th>singular</th>\n<th class=\"last\">plural</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">1</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">moj</b> <i>my</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">naš</b> <i>our</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">2</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tvoj</b> <i>your</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vaš</b> <i>your</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">3 m, n</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">njegov</b> <i>his</i>, <i>its</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">njihov</b> <i>their</i></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">3 f</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">njen</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">njezin</b> <i>her</i></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">refl.</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">—</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The pronoun <b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b> is possessive reflexive, used when something belongs to the subject. In real life, the 1st person <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b> is often used instead, especially for emphasis.</p>\n<p>Words <b class=\"hrv\">moj</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">tvoj</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b> have additionally special, shorter forms in masculine and neuter genders in singular:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">gender</th>\n<th class=\"hc-n\"> N</th>\n<th class=\"hc-a\"> A</th>\n<th class=\"hc-g\"> G</th>\n<th class=\"last hc-dl\"> DL</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masc. anim.</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">moj</b></td>\n<td>= G</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">mojeg</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">mog</b>(<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b>) \n</td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">mojem</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">u</b>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">mom</b>(<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>)\n</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masc. inan.</td>\n<td>= N</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">neuter</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">moje</b></td>\n<td>= N</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The feminine forms are regular.</p>\n<p>Forms for <b class=\"hrv\">tvoj</b> follow the same pattern (<b class=\"hrv\">svoj</b> has exactly the same forms, but with <b class=\"hrv\">sv-</b> instead of <b class=\"hrv\">tv-</b>):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">gender</th>\n<th class=\"hc-n\"> N</th>\n<th class=\"hc-a\"> A</th>\n<th class=\"hc-g\"> G</th>\n<th class=\"last hc-dl\"> DL</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masc. anim.</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\"><b class=\"hrv\">tvoj</b></td>\n<td>= G</td>\n<td rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">tvojeg</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">tvog</b>(<b class=\"hrvc\">a</b>) \n</td>\n<td class=\"last\" rowspan=\"3\"><b class=\"hrv\">tvojem</b>(<b class=\"hrv\">u</b>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">tvom</b>(<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>)\n</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">masc. inan.</td>\n<td>= N</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">neuter</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">tvoje</b></td>\n<td>= N</td>\n</tr></table>\n<h2>General pronouns</h2>\n<p><em>Correlatives</em> or <em>general pro-words</em> are best described in a big table. I will follow this system: columns show what is refered to (person, place, time...) while rows show the kind of reference (e.g. <i>some-one</i>, <i>any-one</i>, <i>no-one</i> etc.).</p>\n<p>Many of these words are simply derived from question-words. For example, from <b class=\"hrv\">kad</b>(<b>a</b>) <i>when</i>, by adding <b class=\"hrv\">ni-</b>, we get <b class=\"hrv\">nikad</b>(<b>a</b>) <i>never</i>, but some words are irregularly derived and break the symmetry, and some forms simply don’t exist.</p>\n<p>Here are some general remarks about rows:</p>\n<p>The rows marked with <i>else</i> are words used in constructions like <i>someone else</i>, <i>elsewhere</i> etc. Croatian doesn’t have a generic word like <i>else</i> in English: each column has its <i>else</i> word which can be used on its own or with the corresponding negative, <i>some-</i> or <i>any-</i> word. For example, the <i>else</i>-place works like this:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">drugdje</b> <i>elsewhere</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">negdje drugdje</b> lit. ‘<i>somewhere elsewhere</i>’ = <i>somewhere else</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">nigdje drugdje</b> lit. ‘<i>nowhere elsewhere</i>’ = <i>nowhere else</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Words in the negative row require the verb to be negated as well.</p>\n<p>Each negative word starts with <b class=\"hrv\">ni-</b>. Remove that <b class=\"hrv\">n-</b> and you’ll get the <i>any-</i>. These words aren’t listed separately, because they are always regular. They are <em>not</em> used in negative sentences (e.g. <i>I didn’t find anything</i>); their main role is to emphasize <i>some-</i> forms, but overall they are seldom used:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imaš li nešto drugo?</b> <i>Do you have something else?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">Imaš li <b class=\"hrvc\">išta</b> drugo?</b> <i>Do you have <u>anything</u> else?</i> (emphasis)\n</p></div>\n<p>While <i>any-</i> words always follow a very simple pattern, many other forms, unfortunately, don’t.

The division presented here is useful for someone learning Croatian as a foreign language.</p>\n<h2>Present tense forms</h2>\n<p>All forms of the present tense have always the same endings (except for three irregular verbs) – only the <em>pres-3pl</em> depends on the vowel <em>pres-3</em> ends in:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>pres-1</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-a-m</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-i-m</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-e-m</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>pres-2</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-a-š</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-i-š</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-e-š</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>pres-3</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-a</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-i</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-e</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><em>pres-1pl</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-a-mo</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-i-mo</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-e-mo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>pres-2pl</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-a-te</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-i-te</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-e-te</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>pres-3pl</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-a<b class=\"hrvc\">ju</b></b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">u</b></b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Two verbs have (fully regular) present forms only:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n(<b class=\"hrv\">bude</b>) perf. <i>be, get, become</i><br/>\n(<b class=\"hrv\">veli</b>) <i>say</i><br/>\n</p>\n<p>While (<b class=\"hrv\">bude</b>) is one of most important verbs in Croatian, the verb (<b class=\"hrv\">veli</b>) is often used only in certain regions.</p>\n<h2>Aorist forms</h2>\n<p>The aorist tense is not frequently used. It's a past tense, sometimes used for events that are about to happen right now. Usually it's formed for perfective verbs, but it can be used with imperfective verbs as well. Its forms are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>aor-1</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-h</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-o-h</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>aor-23</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b></b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><em>aor-1pl</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-smo</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-o-smo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>aor-2pl</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-ste</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-o-ste</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><em>aor-3pl</em></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">-še</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-o-še</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The endings with a vowel (<b class=\"hrv\">-o-h</b>, etc.) are used only with verbs that have infinitives ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-sti</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ći</b>. For all other verbs, the aorist forms are simply formed from the infinitive by discarding <b class=\"hrv\">-ti</b> and adding aorist endings:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"><em>inf</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\"><em>aor-1</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">na<u>u</u>či<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b>\nperf. <i>learn</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">na<u>u</u>či<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">uze<b class=\"hrvc\">ti</b></b>\nperf. <i>take</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">uze<b class=\"hrvc\">h</b></b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">poje<b class=\"hrvc\">sti</b></b>\nperf. <i>eat</i></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">pojed<b class=\"hrvc\">oh</b></b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>For more information about forming the aorist tense for verbs in <b class=\"hrv\">-sti</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-ći</b>, check <em><a href=\"#root-cons\">With possible sound shifts in infinitive and present</a></em> below.</p>\n<h2>Simple verb classes</h2>\n<p>These are the easiest verb classes:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>  <em>inf</em></th>\n<th><em>pres-3</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\"><em>past-m</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">a</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-a-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-a</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-a-o</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">i</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-i-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-i</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-i-o</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">n</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">nu</b>-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">n</b>-e</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">nu</b>-o</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">ova/uje</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">ova</b>-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">uj</b>-e</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">ova</b>-o</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Two out of four classes are completely determined by their infinitive form: all verbs with infinitives in <b class=\"hrv\">-nuti</b> belong to the n-verbs, and all verbs with infinitives in <b class=\"hrv\">-ovati</b> belong to ova/uje-verbs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't hold for verbs ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-ati</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">-iti</b>: they are <em>not</em> all a-verbs or i-verbs.</p>\n<p>A great majority of verbs belong to these four verb classes. Past forms are simply obtained from the infinitive. Unprefixed a-verbs are more or less all <em>imperfective</em>, as almost all ova/uje-verbs. Virtually all n-verbs are <em>perfective</em>, except for the following verbs:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">brinuti</b> <i>worry</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čeznuti</b> <i>yearn</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ginuti</b> <i>perish, die</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">tonuti</b> <i>sink</i>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trnuti</b> <i>numb</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trunuti</b> <i>rot</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">venuti</b> <i>wither</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The a-verbs are the <em>default class</em> of verbs: all new verbs that are adapted into Croatian (mostly colloquially) are adapted as a-verbs:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">četati</b> <em>chat</em> (over Internet)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">printati</b> <em>print</em> (from a PC)<br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(It seems that in Serbia ova/uje is the default verb class.)</p>\n<h2>Unpredictable classes, without shifts</h2>\n<p>A bit more difficult classes are <em>unpredictable, without sound shifts</em>. You basically have to remember both infinitive and <em>pres-3</em> form; however, there are no sound shifts. There are 7 classes in this group, divided into 2 subgroups. The first four are:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>  <em>inf</em></th>\n<th><em>pres-3</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\"><em>past-m</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">ava/aje</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">av</b>a-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">aj</b>-e</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">av</b>a-o</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">eva/uje</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">ev</b>a-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">uj</b>-e</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">ev</b>a-o</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">iva/uje</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">iv</b>a-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">uj</b>-e</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">iv</b>a-o</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">uva/uje</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">uv</b>a-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">uj</b>-e</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">uv</b>a-o</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>They all have <b class=\"hrv\">-ati</b> in the infinitive and are overall similar to a-verbs, except for the present forms. Three classes (ava/aje, eva/uje, uva/uje) out of the 4 above contain only a handful of of verbs. Common ones are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">daje</b>) <i>give</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">-znavati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-znaje</b>)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">carevati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">caruje</b>) <i>rule as an emperor</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kraljevati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">kraljuje</b>) <i>rule as a king</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bljuvati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">bljuje</b>) <i>vomit</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pljuvati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">pljuje</b>) <i>spit</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>All verbs listed are <em>imperfective</em>. Of course, verbs derived by prefixing those listed above belong to the same class, but some are <em>perfective</em>. Often used are ones derived from <b class=\"hrv\">davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">daje</b>), e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">do-davati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">do-daje</b>). The \"verb\" <b class=\"hrv\">-znavati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">-znaje</b>) is not used on its own, only verbs derived from it by prefixing are used, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">po-znavati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">po-znaje</b>).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, verbs ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-ivati</b> can be either a-verbs – e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">plivati</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">pozivati</b> – or iva/uje-verbs – e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">dokazivati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dokazuje</b>), etc. There are many iva/uje-verbs – too much to list here.</p>\n<p>The next three classes are a bit more complicated, as two of them have a (predictable) alternation in the past forms. It's interesting that for some of them, Standard forms are different from forms used in speech and casual writing most of the time:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>  <em>inf</em></th>\n<th><em>pres-3</em></th>\n<th><em>past-m</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\"><em>past-f</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">a/i</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-a-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-a-o</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-a-la</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">je/i</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>-o</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>-la</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">je/ije</td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>-ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">ij</b>-e</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>-o</b></td>\n<td class=\"rgh last\"><b class=\"hrv\">-<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>-la</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Only a limited number of verbs belong to the a/i-verbs. Some of them have general, quite basic meanings:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bježati</b> <i>run away</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bojati</b> <i>paint</i> (wall, fence) *<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bojati</b> <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² <i>be afraid</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">brojati</b> <i>count</i> *<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">čučati</b> <i>squat</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">držati</b> <i>hold</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ležati</b> <i>lay</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">klečati</b> <i>kneel</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trčati</b> <i>run</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">spati</b> <i>sleep</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">stajati</b> (<b class=\"hrvc\">st<u>o</u>ji</b>) <i>stand</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">-stojati</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">strujati</b> <i>stream</i> *<br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>(Only infinitives are listed, <em>pres-3</em> forms end in <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b>!) The verb <b class=\"hrv\">stajati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">st<u>o</u>ji</b>) <i>stand</i> is irregular. This does not apply to verb derived from it, which have regular forms from <b class=\"hrv\">-stojati</b>. The verb <b class=\"hrv\">spati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">spi</b>) <i>sleep</i> is quite archaic, but still used in some regions (however, verbs derived from it are common). Besides it, all a/i-verb feature Croatian-specific consonants.</p>\n<p>The rest of a/i-verbs in common use stand for various sounds (again, I list only infinitives):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bečati</b> <i>cry</i> (baby)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">blejati</b> <i>bleat</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">brujati</b> <i>hum</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">cvrčati</b> <i>chirr</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">hučati</b> <i>boom</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ječati</b> <i>cry, shrill</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pištati</b> <i>squeak, beep</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pljuštati</b> <i>rain heavily, shower</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">režati</b> <i>growl</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">šuštati</b> <i>rustle, murmur</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrištati</b> <i>scream</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zujati</b> <i>buzz</i> *<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zvečati</b> <i>twang</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zviždati</b> <i>whistle</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zvučati</b> <i>sound</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>All a/i-verbs listed here are <em>imperfective</em>, and verbs derived from by prefixing are also a/i-verbs, but <em>perfective</em>, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>o</u>t<u>r</u>čati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">d<u>o</u>t<u>r</u>či</b>), <b class=\"hrv\">zaspati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>a</u>spi</b>)...</p>\n<p>As a rule, a/i-verbs have the stress fixed on the first syllable in the present tense, i.e. the stress doesn't shift to negation in the standard stress scheme:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">bježati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">bj<u>e</u>ži</b>) <i>run away</i><br/>\n. . .</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrištati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">vr<u>i</u>šti</b>) <i>scream</i><br/>\n. . .\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The only exception is the verb <b class=\"hrv\">spati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">spi</b>) <i>sleep</i>.</p>\n<p>Four a/i-verbs above are marked with an asterisk (*).

Of course, this applies to all verbs derived by prefixing from the verbs above, e.g. instead of <b class=\"hrv\">ostarjeti</b> you will mostly see just <b class=\"hrv\">ostariti</b>.</p>\n<p>For the following common verbs, i-forms prevail in casual communication, while je/i-forms prevail in written communication, newspapers, etc. (again, only infinitives are listed):</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gorjeti</b> <i>burn</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">grmjeti</b> <i>thunder</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">smrdjeti</b> <i>stink</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">štedjeti</b> <i>save (money)</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">šutjeti</b> <i>be quiet</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">trpjeti</b> <i>suffer</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrtjeti</b> <i>spin, turn</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">visjeti</b> <i>hang</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">vrvjeti</b> <i>swarm</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">žudjeti</b> <i>yearn</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<h2>With a possible sound shift in present</h2>\n<p>This is a class (or two classes, if you like it) that contains a lot of verbs.

These verbs are <em>imperfective</em>; verbs derived from them by prefixing (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">u-mrijeti</b>) are <em>perfective</em>, and still belong to this class.

Everything that follows applies to Standard Croatian <em>and</em> Standard Bosnian <em>and</em> Standard Serbian unless otherwise is explicitly stated.</p>\n<h2>General Issues</h2>\n<p>First, in the Standard Croatian, each vowel can be either <em>short</em> or <em>long</em>. There can be more than one long vowel in one word. I will mark the vowels as:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">Vowel length</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">short vowel</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">a</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">long vowel</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">ā</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>This holds also for “vocalic” <b class=\"hrv\">r</b>: there’s long <b class=\"hrv\">r̄ </b>; however I will mark it as <b class=\"hrv\">ŕ</b>, since just a line over <b class=\"hrv\">r</b> is, unfortunately, not rendered right in some browsers and mobile phones.</p>\n<p>The stress can be either <em>falling</em> or <em>rising</em>. The falling stress has a tone that’s audibly first high and then falling and staying low. Since the stressed vowel can be either short or long, there are 4 combinations – the 4 classic “accents” as described in the 19th century:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"3\">   short vowel</th>\n<th class=\"last\" colspan=\"3\">   long vowel</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">falling<br/>stress</td>\n<td class=\"last vtop\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_stress_key.png\"/><br/>\n </td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_falling1.png\"/><br/>\n  <b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u></b> -</td>\n<td class=\"first\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_falling2.png\"/>\n<br/>\n  <b class=\"hrv\">ba</b></td>\n<td class=\"last vtop\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_stress_key.png\"/><br/>\n </td><td class=\"first last\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_falling_l1.png\"/><br/>\n    <b class=\"hrv\">s<u>ū</u>n</b> -\n</td><td class=\"first last\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_falling2.png\"/><br/>\n  <b class=\"hrv\">ce</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">rising<br/>stress</td>\n<td class=\"last vtop\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_stress_key.png\"/><br/>\n </td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_rising1.png\"/><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>o</u></b> -\n</td><td class=\"first\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_rising2.png\"/>\n<br/>\n  <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>a</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last vtop\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_stress_key.png\"/><br/>\n </td><td class=\"first last\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_rising_l1.png\"/><br/>\n    <b class=\"hrv\">r<u>ū</u></b> -</td>\n<td class=\"first last\">\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_rising2.png\"/><br/>\n  <b class=\"hrv\">k<u>a</u></b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>I have introduced here the following, special, non-standard markings:</p>\n<ul><li>if only <em>one vowel</em> is underlined, it’s the stressed vowel with the <em>falling</em> intonation;</li>\n<li>if <em>two vowels</em> are underlined, one after another, the first of them is the stressed vowel with the <em>rising</em> intonation;</li>\n<li>as a special case, if <em>no vowels</em> are underlined, the first vowel is stressed with the <em>falling</em> intonation (you’ll see the reason a bit later).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(There <em>are</em> also standard stress markings in Croatian. However, these markings are not really transparent, so in certain books and linguistic works, alternative marks are often used.)</p>\n<p>Now, most textbooks (including the schoolbooks in Croatia) mention two classic rules that restrict the place of stress:</p>\n<p>#1 the <em>falling</em> intonation can appear only on the first syllable;<br/>\n#2 the <em>rising</em> intonation cannot appear on the last syllable (therefore it cannot appear at all in one-syllable words).</p>\n<p>Now, the restriction #2 is actually obvious from my notation: you have to underline <em>two</em> vowels, therefore, you need a word with at least two vowels! There’s no way to set a rising stress on the last vowel – only the first vowel you underlined will be stressed.</p>\n<p>However, the restriction #1 is not obvious, and it’s actually not always respected in real life, even in areas where people use stress very close to the standard at home (enter <em>non-initial falling tones</em> into Google™).</p>\n<p>This all so far is only the introduction to real issues. The main feature of stress in Standard Croatian is that it changes in various forms of one word. Moreover, the vowel length changes in some forms! For example, the word <b class=\"hrv\">lonac</b> <em>pot</em> has all possible alternations (rising vs. falling, short vs. long vowel):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th>sing.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">plur.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">N</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">l<u>o</u>n<u>a</u>c</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">l<u>ō</u>nci</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">G</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">l<u>ō</u>nc<u>a</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">l<u>o</u>nācā</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>On the other hand, there are words that have the same stress in all forms. To make it even more complex, stress sometimes shift to prepositions.</p>\n<h2>Noun Stress</h2>\n<p>However, there’s an underlying system, bizarre but regular. Let’s first visit the noun stress: nouns are basically divided into three groups. Let’s first see how the a-nouns (nouns ending in <b class=\"hrv\">-a</b> in N) behave:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\"></th>\n<th></th>\n<th>\"A\"</th>\n<th></th>\n<th>\"B\"</th>\n<th></th>\n<th class=\"last\">\"C\"</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">N</td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u>ba</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>a</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><b class=\"hrv\">v<u>o</u>d<u>a</u></b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">DL</td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u>bi</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>i</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><b class=\"hrv\">v<u>o</u>d<u>i</u></b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">G</td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u>bē</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>ē</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><b class=\"hrv\">v<u>o</u>d<u>ē</u></b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">A</td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\"><br/><b class=\"hrvc\"><u>u</u></b>-</td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u>bu</b>\n<br/><b class=\"hrvc\">r<u>i</u>bu</b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\"><br/><b class=\"hrv\">u</b>-</td>\n<td class=\"first rgh\"><b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>u</u></b>\n<br/><b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>u</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last rgh\"><br/><b class=\"hrv\">u</b>-</td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><b class=\"hrvc\">vodu</b>\n<br/><b class=\"hrv\">vodu</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">V</td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ribo</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ženo</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vodo</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\">NA-<em>pl</em></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u>be</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>e</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"></td>\n<td class=\"first last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vode</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>We see one thing all nouns have in common: the vocative case has the “automatic” falling stress – no vowels are underlined. Another thing that’s not obvious from the usual spelling – the case ending in G is a long <b class=\"hrv\">e</b>.</p>\n<p>The nouns in the group \"B\" are boring: the stress stays on the same syllable and is same in all forms (except in the vocative, but that’s a special form anyway).</p>\n<p>The group “A” gets interesting when an unstressed preposition (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>) is placed before the noun: the stress “spreads” to it, i.e. moves one syllable to the left, but gets the <em>rising</em> intonation.</p>\n<p>This stress shift we still see in such nouns is called <em>Neoštokavian stress shift</em>. It’s the origin of the rising intonation in the Standard Croatian: whenever (well... <em>almost whenever</em>) there was another syllable before the stressed syllable with the falling intonation, the stress moved left, and changed the intonation. It also happened centuries ago to nouns like <b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>a</u></b>. There are still regions in Croatia where that noun keeps the older stress, <b class=\"hrv\">žen<u>a</u></b> (most people assume that stress is older because such nouns in Russian have the stress at that position as well, but other scenarios are possible in principle).</p>\n<p>This is why a rising stress cannot appear on the last syllable – there have to be one syllable after it, one that had the original (falling) stress. We can simply show what has happened and what still happens:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first last\" colspan=\"2\">Neoštokavian stress shift</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">centuries ago</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">žen<u>a</u></b> → <b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>n<u>a</u></b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">we see today</td><td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">po</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u>bu</b> → <b class=\"hrv\">p<u>o</u></b>-<b class=\"hrv\">r<u>i</u>bu</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>Such stresses are called ‘<em>new</em>’ (this is relative: they are centuries old), hence the <em>neo-</em> in Neoštokavian.</p>\n<p>This shift happens <em>only</em> to falling stresses. They were transformed almost always when they were not on the first syllable – this is the reason for the classic rule #1.</p>\n<p>Now, we examine the nouns in the group “C”. They are completely unlike “A” or “B” nouns: their stress varies according to noun case. In the accusative case, if there’s an unstressed preposition before the noun, the stress again shifts to it, but it’s <em>still falling</em>. In fact, it shifts as leftward as it can:</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">vo</b>du</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">u</b></b>-<b class=\"hrv\">vodu</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><b class=\"hrvc\">i</b></b>-<b class=\"hrv\">u</b>-<b class=\"hrv\">vodu</b>\n</p>\n<p>Such shift is the reason for my \"special case\" notation – when no vowels are underlined, as in A and N-<em>pl</em> of “C” nouns – there’s a falling intonation stress on the very first syllable, including all unstressed words before the noun that are pronounced together with it.</p>\n<p>There’s no way to tell which nouns are in the group “C” just by looking at them in the nominative – they must be remembered. Textbooks say there’s about 60 such a-nouns. The common ones are:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">d<u>a</u>sk<u>a</u></b> <i>plank</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gr<u>ā</u>n<u>a</u></b> <i>branch</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gr<u>ē</u>d<u>a</u></b> <i>wooden beam</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>i</u>gl<u>a</u></b> <i>needle</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">k<u>o</u>s<u>a</u></b> <i>hair</i> (on scalp)<br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">m<u>e</u>tl<u>a</u></b> <i>broom</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>o</u>vc<u>a</u></b> <i>sheep</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">pč<u>e</u>l<u>a</u></b> <i>bee</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">p<u>ē</u>t<u>a</u></b> <i>heel</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">r<u>o</u>s<u>a</u></b> <i>dew</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sr<s>i</s>j<u>ē</u>d<u>a</u></b> <i>Wednesday</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">str<s>i</s>j<u>ē</u>l<u>a</u></b> <i>arrow</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>ŕ</u>n<u>a</u></b> <i>fem. roe deer</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">st<s>i</s>j<u>ē</u>n<u>a</u></b> <i>rock</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">str<u>ā</u>n<u>a</u></b> <i>side</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>ō</u>jsk<u>a</u></b> <i>army</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>o</u>r<u>a</u></b> <i>dawn</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>ī</u>m<u>a</u></b> <i>winter</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">zv<s>i</s>j<u>ē</u>zd<u>a</u></b> <i>star</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The nouns above have the strange “automatic” falling stress only in A. However, a couple of common nouns can have such stress in DL as well:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">d<u>ū</u>š<u>a</u></b> <i>soul</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">gl<u>ā</u>v<u>a</u></b> <i>head</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">n<u>o</u>g<u>a</u></b> <i>leg</i><br/>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">r<u>ū</u>k<u>a</u></b> <i>arm/hand</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>o</u>d<u>a</u></b> <i>water</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">z<u>e</u>mlj<u>a</u></b> <i>ground, country, Earth</i><br/>\n</td></tr></table>\n<!--\n\nbùha \"flea\" &#8224;&#8224;\nmùha \"fly\" &#8224;&#8224;\nslúga \"servant\" &#8224;\nsvínja \"pig\" &#8224;\nzmìja \"snake\" &#8224;&#8224;\n\nMany nouns are marked with an asterisk (*): they can have the same falling stress also in dat. sg. Some others are marked with dagger (&#8224;): they can have a rising stress in acc. sg; ones marked with a double dagger have always a rising stress in acc. sg.\n\nDont forget that zvijézda is just an unfortunate spelling convetion; it&#8217;s pronounced /zvjézda/, acc. sg. /zvjēzdu/!\n\nFrequently, even when people speak Standard Croatian, they regard many of such nouns as having the fixed stress (as in nom. sg.).\n\n-->\n<p>It’s safe to assume that all other a-nouns have the fixed stress.</p>\n<p>Then, we examine masculine nouns (ones not ending in <b class=\"hrv\">a</b>). We have again the three groups, but the results are a bit different, since masculine nouns have no ending in N, so the stress in group \"B\" shifts:</p>\n<p>(the following table is under

Both these areas are essentially <em>dialect continua</em>, that is, areas where any dialect is similar to the dialect next to it, which is similar to the one next to it, and so on: difference between dialects increases with distance, and there are very few sharp dialect borders.</p>\n\n<p>Many features of South Slavic dialects change roughly in the northwest-southeast direction, represented by the arrow in this map:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_DialectGradient.png\" title=\"South Slavic dialect gradient\" />\n\n<p>(The arrow should go, and does go further into Macedonia and Bulgaria, but I will concentrate on dialects in Croatia and countries next to it.)</p>\n\n<p>Going in the direction of the arrow (i.e. to the south-east), features change in this way:</p>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>&#8226; There are <em>fewer noun forms</em> (that is, different case endings). In Slovenia, nouns have singular, dual and plural forms, and 6 cases with different endings in plural. In the area around Niš, Serbia, there is only singular and plural, and only two cases (N and A). In Macedonia, nouns have no cases! This doesn't apply to the vocative case, though.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>&#8226; There are <em>more verb tenses in use</em>. In the western parts of Croatia, the aorist tense is very rarely used. It doesn't exist at all in Slovenia. In Serbia, it's used every day in speech. When you reach Macedonia, there are 9 tenses.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>&#8226; <em>Infinitives are less used</em> and finally disappear in South of Serbia, where only <b class=\"hrv\">da</b> + present is used.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>&#8226; <em>Vocatives are more often used</em> &#8211; in western parts of Croatia, vocatives are rare, N is used when calling someone. In Bosnia and Serbia, they are frequently used.</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>&#8226; There are <em>more Greek and Turkish loan words</em> further you go to the south-east.</p></div>\n\n<p>There are couple of forms that are specific for &#8216;west&#8217; and &#8216;east&#8217;:</p>\n\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">&nbsp;</th>\n<th>&#8216;west&#8217;</th>\n<th class=\"last\">&#8216;east&#8217;</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>you can</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">moreš</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">možeš</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>four men/boys</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">četvero</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">četvoro</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n\n<p>Each feature splits the area at a different line. Standard Croatian has the &#8216;eastern&#8217; <b class=\"hrv\">možeš</b>, but the &#8216;western&#8217; <b class=\"hrv\">četvero</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there's something interesting: <em>most dialectal variation is in the northwest</em>. In the central and southeastern areas, there's less dialects on the same land area. (That's due to history.) It's obvious from this simplified and not-too-accurate dialect map, showing the dialects in villages in middle 20th century (click on the image to enlarge):</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_DialectMap.png\" target=\"_x\"><img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_DialectMap.png\" title=\"Western South Slavic dialect map\" width=\"632px\"/></a>\n\n<p>Dialects are marked with the following two-letter abbreviations, here grouped into traditional dialect groups (the usual term in Croatian is <b class=\"hrv\">narječje</b>):</p>\n\n<p><em>&#8216;Slovene&#8217;</em>: CR - Carinthian, ST - Styrian, PA - Pannonian, UC - Upper Carniolan, LC - Lower Carniolan, RV - Rovte, LI - Littoral;</p>\n\n<p><em>&#8216;Kajkavian&#8217;</em>: ZM - Zagorje-Međimurje, TP - Turopolje-Posavina, KP - Križevci-Podravina, PR - Prigorje;</p>\n\n<p><em>&#8216;Čakavian&#8217;</em>: NČ - Northwestern Čakavian, CČ - Central Čakavian, SČ - Southeastern Čakavian;</p>\n\n<p><em>&#8216;Štokavian&#8217;</em>: SL - Slavonian, WI - Western Ikavian, HK - Herzegovina-Krajina (East Herzegovinian), EB - East Bosnian, ŠV - Šumadija-Vojvodina, SM - Smederevo-Vršac, ZS - Zeta-Sandžak, KR - Kosovo-Resava;</p>\n\n<p><em>&#8216;Torlak&#8217;</em>: PM - Prizren-South Morava, TL - Timok-Lužnica.</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways to divide dialects: for example, the classification of &#8216;Čakavian&#8217; dialects shown here is after Dutch linguist Willem Vermeer; you'll find other ways to classify them in many books. Some dialects shown here together are usually shown separately &#8211; even if they are quite alike neighboring ones &#8211; for traditional (and political) reasons (e.g. Lower Carniolan dialects in Croatia are usually shown separately as &#8216;goranski&#8217;, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The grouping of dialects into &#8216;Kajkavian&#8217;, &#8216;Čakavian&#8217; and &#8216;Štokavian&#8217; is usually presented as something fundamental. However, it's not really so: for example, Northwestern Čakavian dialects have a lot of similarities with the Littoral dialects in Slovenia; &#8216;Kajkavian&#8217; Zagorje-Međimurje dialects have many similarities with Pannonian dialects in Slovenia; &#8216;Torlak&#8217; dialects are often grouped with &#8216;Štokavian&#8217;, but they have many similarities with dialects in Macedonia and Bulgaria as well; there's no sharp border between Southeastern Čakavian and &#8216;Štokavian&#8217; Western Ikavian; &#8216;Štokavian&#8217; Slavonian dialects have similarities with &#8216;Čakavian&#8217; dialects, etc.</p>\n\n<h2>The Origin of Dialects</h2>\n\n<p>Western South Slavic Dialects differ in many ways, one of them is development of old vowels. Western South Slavic, some 1000 years ago, had the following vowels (the situation was different in Eastern South Slavic, i.e. today Macedonia and Bulgaria), and all of them could be either short or long:</p>\n\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first cent\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">i &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; u</b><br>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">ě &nbsp; &nbsp; ə &nbsp; &nbsp; ö</b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">e <b class=\"hrvc\">ë</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; o&nbsp;</b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">a</b>\n</td><td class=\"last vcent\">\n&nbsp; <b class=\"hrvc\">l</b> &nbsp; <b class=\"hrv\">r</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>To mark long vowels, in descriptions of old, reconstructed forms, and in brief descriptions of various dialects, I&#8217;ll just write them double, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">aa</b> or <b class=\"hrv\">ee</b>. For instance <i>sun</i> was <b class=\"hrv\">s<u>l</u>lnce</b> and <i>hand</i> was <b class=\"hrv\">röök<u>a</u></b>.</p>\n\n<p>Developments of the old vowels <b class=\"hrv\">ě</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">ə</b> &#8211; often called <em>yat</em> and <em>yer</em> &#8211; are most obvious to the majority of speakers. Actually, &#8216;Ijekavian&#8217;, &#8216;Ikavian&#8217; and &#8216;Ekavian&#8217; are just different developments of the vowel <b class=\"hrv\">ě</b> (<em>yat</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The vowels <b class=\"hrv\">ë</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">ö</b> were nasal, like in today French or Portuguese.</p>\n\n<p>There were also two specific consonants, usually labelled as <b class=\"hrv\">d'</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">t'</b>. They were palatal (softened) <b class=\"hrv\">d</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">t</b>. The verb <b class=\"hrv\">doći</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dođe</b>) was earlier <b class=\"hrv\">dojti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">dojde</b>); in some dialects, <b class=\"hrv\">jt</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">jd</b> have later changed.</p>\n\n<p>(I'm using slightly specific symbols here; usually, in specialized literature, <b class=\"hrv\">ę</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">ǫ</b> are used instead of my <b class=\"hrv\">ë</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">ö</b>. Unfortunately, they are not displayed properly on some mobile phones and e-book readers. Also, <b class=\"hrv\">ḷ</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">ṛ</b> are usually used instead of <b class=\"hrv\">l</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">r</b>. Neither symbols are compatible with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet\">IPA notation</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Then, we need marks for various types of stress. I&#8217;ll use the following marks for stress and tones within <em>one</em> syllable:</p>\n\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">short, stressed</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u>a</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">long stressed vowel with a falling tone</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">a<u>a</u></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\">long stressed vowel with a rising/flat tone</td>\n</tr></table>\n\n<p>The tone I mark as <b class=\"hrv\">a<u>a</u></b> is also called &#8216;neoacute&#8217;; it doesn&#8217;t exist in Standard Croatian.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, I&#8217;ll use the following marks for two-syllable tones, where the stressed syllable has another syllable with the high tone that follows it:</p>\n\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u>...<u>a</u></b></td>\n<td>short stressed</td>\n<td class=\"last vcent\" rowspan=\"2\">+ a high tone following it</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">a<u>a</u>...<u>a</u></b></td>\n<td>long stressed</td>\n</tr></table>\n\n<p>This can be summarized simply: the first underscored vowel is stressed, the underscores mark high tones.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to read any dialectological works, you&#8217;ll see the standard &#8216;accent marks&#8217;. Unfortunately, they are not rendered well on some mobile phones and e-book readers, they are difficult to distinguish at small font sizes, and, finally, they are quite counter-intuitive. Here's how my marks translate to the standard ones (the diacritics are also shown in brackets):</p>\n\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">aa</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">ā</b> (&#8211;)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u></b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">a&#783;</b> (\\\\)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u>a</b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">a&#785;</b> (^)&nbsp;\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">a<u>a</u></b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">ã</b> (~)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\"><u>a</u>...<u>a</u></b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">à...a</b> (\\)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">a<u>a</u>...<u>a</u></b> = <b class=\"hrvc\">á...a</b> (/)\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>Therefore, what I write as e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">ö<u>ö</u></b> is in most linguistic works written as <b class=\"hrv\">ǫ</b> with-a-tilde-above.</p>\n\n<p>Stress systems in various dialects have the origin in the old system, reconstructed for the old West South Slavic, for the period od some 1000 years ago, where there were at least 2 tones on the syllables. The stress could have been on any syllable, and unstressed syllables could be also short or long. The reconstructed forms of some words are:</p>\n\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">mlěěk<u>o</u></b> <i>milk</i><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">röök<u>a</u></b> <i>hand</i><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">v<u>ě</u>tər</b> <i>wind</i><br>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">klju<u>u</u>č</b> <i>key</i> (G <b class=\"hrv\">kljuuč<u>a</u></b>)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">sestr<u>a</u></b> <i>sister</i> (G-<em>pl</em> <b class=\"hrv\">sestə<u>ə</u>r</b>)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">žen<u>a</u></b> <i>woman, wife</i> (A <b class=\"hrv\">ž<u>e</u>nö</b>)<br>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>(It's possible to reconstruct even earlier forms &#8211; in many cases, thousands years earlier &#8211; but they aren't important here.)</p>\n\n<h2>&#8216;Kajkavian&#8217; (Zagorje-Međimurje)</h2>\n\n<p>An example &#8216;Kajkavian&#8217; dialect is the speech of Konjščina, with a detailed description by Vedrana Gudek, available <a href=\"http://darhiv.ffzg.unizg.hr/2149/1/Gudek%2C%20dipl.%20rad%20_Opis%20govora%20G.%20Konj%C5%A1%C4%8Dine_.pdf\">online</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The first impression anyone has about &#8216;Kajkavian&#8217; are specific vowels. While there are only 5 vowels in e.g. Zagreb, the traditional speech of Konjščina has many more:</p>\n\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\" class=\"first\">short</th>\n<th>&nbsp;</th>\n<th colspan=\"2\" class=\"last\">long/diphtongs</th>\n</tr><tr><td class=\"first\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">i</b><br><b class=\"hrv\">e</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b class=\"hrv\">ε</b>\n</td><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">u</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b class=\"hrv\">o</b><br><b class=\"hrv\">a</b>\n</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=\"cent\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">ii</b><br><b class=\"hrv\">ie</b> &nbsp; <b class=\"hrv\">ee</b>\n<br>&nbsp;<br><b class=\"hrv\">εε</b>\n</td><td class=\"last cent\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">uu</b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">uo</b> &nbsp; <b class=\"hrv\">ou</b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">oo</b><br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">aa</b>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>The vowel <b class=\"hrv\">ε</b> &#8211; a kind of &#8216;open e&#8217;, like in English <em>bad</em> or German <em>ä</em> &#8211; is the characteristic vowel for &#8216;Kajkavian&#8217;. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s usually written just as <b class=\"hrv\">e</b>: there's no proper orthography for it (dialectologists usually use <b class=\"hrv\">ȩ</b>, which is not visible on all devices, or sometimes <b class=\"hrv\">æ</b>).</p>\n\n<p>Vowels <b class=\"hrv\">ie</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">uo</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">ou</b> are <em>diphtongs</em>, similar to English <em>ow</em> in <em>low</em>, <em>how</em>, but the <b class=\"hrv\">i</b>'s and <b class=\"hrv\">u</b>'s in them are, unlike in English, pronounced very quickly, they are very short, so I could have written them also as <b class=\"hrv\"><sup>i</sup>e</b>, <b class=\"hrv\"><sup>u</sup>o</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">o<sup>u</sup></b>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, long vowels <b class=\"hrv\">ii</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">εε</b> are too usually written just with <b class=\"hrv\">i</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">e</b>. Here are a couple of words with various vowels:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">di<u>e</u>tε</b>\n<a class=\"player\" title=\"click to play\" onclick=\"playsnd('a8_kajk_diete')\">&nbsp;&#9654;&nbsp;</a>\n<i>child</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">djete</b>, usually spelled <b class=\"hrv\">d<s>i</s>jete</b>)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">m<u>ε</u>εse</b>\n<a class=\"player\" title=\"click to play\" onclick=\"playsnd('a8_kajk_mese')\">&nbsp;&#9654;&nbsp;</a>\n<i>meat</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">meso</b>)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ro<u>u</u>ka</b>\n<a class=\"player\" title=\"click to play\" onclick=\"playsnd('a8_kajk_rouka')\">&nbsp;&#9654;&nbsp;</a>\n<i>hand</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">ruka</b>)<br>\n<b class=\"hrv\">s<u>u</u>once</b>\n<a class=\"player\" title=\"click to play\" onclick=\"playsnd('a8_kajk_suonce')\">&nbsp;&#9654;&nbsp;</a>\n<i>sun</i> (<b class=\"hrv\">sunce</b>)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n-->\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_BEGIN-->\n<!-- The sound clips are by a native &#8216;Kajkavian&#8217; speaker, from a village 14 km from Konjščina, speaking a very similar dialect.\n\n-->\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_END-->\n<!--\n\n(For comparison, forms spoken in Zagreb are given in brackets).</p>\n\n<p>In &#8216;Kajkavian&#8217; (and in dialects in Slovenia) there's one important constraint: normally, only stressed vowels can be long, i.e. there are no unstressed long vowels, while stressed vowels can be either long or short.

I will summarize the most important differences.</p>\n<p>You should keep in mind that there are regions in Croatia where some ‘Serbian’ words are used, and some ‘Croatian’ words can be found in Serbia as well. Of course, Bosnian and Montenegrin are somewhere in the middle. Furthermore, we can talk about ‘Croatian’ and ‘Serbian’ <em>only</em> if we discuss the standardized languages. If we take into the account how people actually speak, the situation is much more complex.</p>\n<h2>Spelling</h2>\n<p>The major difference is that Serbian and Montenegrin use another alphabet – <em>Cyrillic</em>. However, each letter of Croatian Latin corresponds to one letter of Serbian Cyrillic.</p>\n<p>Actually, in Serbia today the Cyrillic alphabet is mostly used in official and ceremonial uses. Majority of newspapers are published in the ‘Serbian Latin’ script (identical to ‘Croatian Latin’). Web sites published in Cyrillic have usually a ‘LAT’ button somewhere. For instance, <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"http://www.politika.rs/\">Politika</a> daily has pages both in Cyrillic and Latin (check CYR and LAT links on top), but <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"http://www.b92.net/\">B92</a> is in Latin only. Even the <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"http://www.srbija.gov.rs/\">web site of Serbian government</a> has links <b class=\"hrv\">ћирилица</b> <i>Cyrillic</i> and <b class=\"hrv\">latinica</b> <i>Latin</i> on the top (<i>Cyrillic</i> is chosen by default). Statistics show that about 1/6 of text on Serbian web sites is written in the Cyrillic script.</p>\n<p>In Montenegro, the Cyrillic alphabet is even less used. The <a class=\"showlink\" href=\"http://www.gov.me/\">web site of Montenegrin government</a> has the two links on top, but the Latin script is displayed as default. Most web pages, even official ones, are in Latin script only.</p>\n<p>Besides using Cyrillic script sometimes, there are few differences in spelling (both in Serbian/Montenegrin Latin and Cyrillic). The first one is spelling of foreign names. Serbian and Montenegrin usually respell them using approximated pronunciation:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">original</th>\n<th class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">  Serbian spelling</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">New York</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">Njujork</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">Њујорк</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">George Bush</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">Džordž Buš</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">Џорџ Буш</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">Chicago</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">Čikago</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">Чикаго</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The second difference is spelling of the future tense. When an infinitive in <b class=\"hrv\">-t</b> is immediately followed by an auxiliary <b class=\"hrv\">ću</b>², <b class=\"hrv\">ćeš</b>²... it’s spelled together, and the infinitive-final <b class=\"hrv\">-t</b> is discarded, with possible sound mutations:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">Croatian</th>\n<th class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">      Serbian</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">pisat ću</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">pisaću</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">писаћу</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">jest ću</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">ješću</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">јешћу</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><b class=\"hrv\">reći ću</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">reći ću</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">рећи ћу</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>This is, however, merely a spelling convention: the words <b class=\"hrv\">ću</b>², <b class=\"hrv\">ćeš</b>² are second-position words; therefore, Serbian words like <b class=\"hrv\">pisaću</b> are limited to the 1st position in a sentence! They are usually listed as separate verb forms in Serbian grammars.</p>\n<h2>Ekavian ‘Pronunciation’</h2>\n<p>As I have already mentioned, there are three common ‘pronunciations’: <em>Ijekavian</em>, <em>Ikavian</em> and <em>Ekavian</em> (there are more in various dialects, but these three prevail in public). The name is misleading, since the difference is visible in spelling as well. The basic difference is: where Standard Croatian has Ijekavian <b class=\"hrv\">ml<b class=\"hrvc\"><s>i</s>je</b>ko</b>, Ikavian has <b class=\"hrv\">ml<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>ko</b> and Ekavian <b class=\"hrv\">ml<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ko</b> for <i>milk</i>.</p>\n<p>People usually associate Ekavian (<b class=\"hrv\">mleko</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">pesma</b>) and not Ijekavian (<b class=\"hrv\">ml<s>i</s>jeko</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">pjesma</b>) with Serbian, but it’s not really true, since <em>Serbs use both</em> as standard: most Serbs outside of Serbia (e.g. Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro) use Ijekavian, and Serbs in most of Serbia, including Belgrade, use only Ekavian. You can find both in Serbian newspapers, but Ekavian clearly dominates. (The Serbian Standard is much less strict than Croatian, there is a bigger choice of ‘acceptable’ variants. If you find a ‘dictionary of differences’ listing <b class=\"hrv\">bijeli</b> as ‘Croatian’ vs. <b class=\"hrv\">beli</b> as ‘Serbian’ you can immediately conclude it’s oversimplifying things.)</p>\n<p>There’s a tradition of playing down differences between Ekavian and Ijekavian: most people, especially in Serbia, are used to hear and read both (but they can write and speak only Ekavian). However, Ekavian forms are not completely trivial – they cannot be completely obtained from (Standard Croatian) Ijekavian forms, and Ijekavian forms <em>cannot be obtained at all</em> from Ekavian. For example, there are some words where Ekavian has <b class=\"hrv\">e</b>, in comparison to Ijekavian <b class=\"hrv\">i</b>, like in these common verbs:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">verb</th><th>Ijekavian</th><th class=\"last\">Ekavian</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>heat</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">gr<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>jati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">gr<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>je</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">gr<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>jati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">gr<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>je</b>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>laugh</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>jati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>i</u></b>je</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>jati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>e</u></b>je</b>) <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>²</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><i>hate</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">m<u>r</u>z<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">mrz<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">m<u>r</u>zi</b>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>sit</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">s<b class=\"hrvc\">j<u>e</u></b>d<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">s<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>d<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">s<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>e</u></b>di</b>)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>be worth</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vr<b class=\"hrvc\"><s>i</s>j<u>e</u></b>d<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>ti</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vr<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>d<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">vr<b class=\"hrvc\"><u>e</u></b>di</b>)</td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>These differences are sometimes surprising to native speakers as well: very few people in Croatia would guess the forms <b class=\"hrv\">mrzeti</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">vredeti</b>. Different verbs have to be learned: the verb <b class=\"hrv\">brijati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">brije</b>) <i>shave</i> has the same form in both ‘pronunciations’, while <b class=\"hrv\">grijati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">grije</b>) <i>heat</i> doesn’t. The verb <b class=\"hrv\">sjediti</b> shows the expected <b class=\"hrv\">je</b> vs. <b class=\"hrv\">e</b> in the 1st syllable, besides the unexpected <b class=\"hrv\">i</b> vs. <b class=\"hrv\">e</b> in the second one (the same holds for <b class=\"hrv\">vr<s>i</s>jediti</b>). Therefore, Ekavian forms of these verbs turn out to be more complicated.</p>\n<p>However, the verb <b class=\"hrv\">vidjeti</b> and similar ones, including <b class=\"hrv\">raz<u>u</u>mjeti</b>, are much simpler in Ekavian: their past forms are always regular, and verbs like <b class=\"hrv\">raz<u>u</u>mjeti</b> are plain verbs in Ekavian, all forms regularly derived from the <em>inf</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">verb</th><th>Ijekavian</th><th class=\"last\">Ekavian</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>want</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">ht<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">hoće</b> +,\n<b class=\"hrv\">ht<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>o</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">ht<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>la</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">ht<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">hoće</b> +)</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>see</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">vid<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">vidi</b>,\n<b class=\"hrv\">vid<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>o</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">vid<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>la</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">vid<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">vidi</b>)</td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><i>understand</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">raz<u>u</u>m<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">raz<u>u</u>mije</b>,...)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">raz<u>u</u>m<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ti</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>may</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\">je</b>ti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\">ije</b></b>,\n<b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\">i</b>o</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\">ije</b>la</b>)</td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">sm<b class=\"hrvc\">e</b>ti</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The Ekavian verbs <b class=\"hrv\">raz<u>u</u>meti</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">smeti</b> have a specific ending in <em>pres-3pl</em>: <b class=\"hrv\">-eju</b>, which is different from Ijekavian or Ikavian.</p>\n<p>Sequences <b class=\"hrv\">-je-</b> in endings of verbal adjectives are not subject to these differences.

Two spelling differences (e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">Njujork</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">imaću</b>) are used sometimes in Bosnian, but it seems that Croatian versions occasionally prevail (<b class=\"hrv\">New York</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">imat ću</b>). Standard Bosnian sometimes freely mixes Croatian and Serbian terms, so both <b class=\"hrv\">tisuća</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">hiljada</b> <i>1000</i> seem acceptable.</p>\n<p>Since Bosnian is a standard used by Bosniaks who are predominantly Muslim, there are lot of oriental and Islamic terms. Sound <b class=\"hrv\">h</b> can be retained, even when not in Croatian (one example is <b class=\"hrv\">lahko</b> <i>easy</i>, acceptable together with <b class=\"hrv\">lako</b>, while Croatian has only the latter form as standard; of course, <b class=\"hrv\">lahko</b> exists in some dialects in Croatia too, but it’s not standard). There are some specific terms, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">daidža</b> <i>uncle</i> (Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">ujak</b>).</p>\n<p>Bosnia-Herzegovina is today officially tri-lingual, as evidenced by this warning on a box of cigarettes that displays three <em>identical</em> sentences (the first one is just in Cyrillic; I have taken a photo of an actual box):</p>\n<img class=\"nbrd\" src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_BCS_cigar.png\" title=\"Bosnian Cigarettes\"/>\n<p>Fingernails are cut by <b class=\"hrv\">rezati</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">reže</b>) in Bosnia, but the verb <b class=\"hrv\">sjeći</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">s<s>i</s>j<u>e</u>če</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">sjekao</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">sjekla</b>) is sometimes used too.</p>\n<div class=\"post-separator\"></div>\n<span class=\"item-control blog-admin pid-1103412481\">\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4214199260768772635&amp;from=pencil\" title=\"Edit Post\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"icon-action\" height=\"18\" src=\"https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif\" width=\"18\"/>\n</a>\n</span>\n<div class=\"post-share-buttons\">\n<a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-email\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4214199260768772635&amp;target=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email This\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Email This</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4214199260768772635&amp;target=blog\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"BlogThis!\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">BlogThis!</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4214199260768772635&amp;target=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to X\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to X</span></a><a class=\"goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=5891322149855073246&amp;postID=4214199260768772635&amp;target=facebook\" onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share to Facebook\"><span class=\"share-button-link-text\">Share to Facebook</span></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<div class=\"breadcrumb\">\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=\"/search/label/?max-results=8\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"title\">Search Post</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<span class=\"one-1\">Label : </span>\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/alphabet\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\nalphabet</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.easy-croatian.com/search/label/regional%20variations\" itemprop=\"url\" rel=\"tag\">\n<span itemprop=\"title\">\nregional variations</span></a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

This speech is also quite well known to people in the surrounding area, and they usually use it in some circumstances (they use their home dialect at home and among friends).</p>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_BEGIN-->\n<!-- sound clips; hosted at OpenDrive.com -->\n<audio id=\"i4_kajk_veter\" src=\"https://od.lk/s/NTZfMTI0Mzc4NjJf/ec_kajk_veter.mp3\"></audio>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_END-->\n<p>Dialects from the wider Zagreb area are usually known as <em>‘Kajkavian’</em>, and they are quite different from the standard Croatian. The dialects were named after the pronoun <b class=\"hrv\">kaj</b> <i>what</i>, used in that areas (compare it to the standard Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">što</b>). The colored areas on this rough map have (or had until very recently) this word for <i>what</i> in the local speech (or a very similar word):</p>\n<img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_Kajkavian.png\" title=\"so-called Kajkavian dialects\"/>\n<p>The darker area is roughly where, besides the word <b class=\"hrv\">kaj</b>, there’s another feature: the word for <i>wind</i> has two same vowels, it’s <b class=\"hrv\">veter</b> <a class=\"player\" onclick=\"playsnd('i4_kajk_veter')\" title=\"play clip\"> ▶ </a>. Many other words have <b class=\"hrv\">e</b> where there’s <b class=\"hrv\">a</b> in standard Croatian in the whole <b class=\"hrv\">kaj</b>-area, such as <b class=\"hrv\">megla</b> <i>fog</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">pes</b> <i>dog</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">steza</b> <i>path</i>, and so on, but <b class=\"hrv\">veter</b> vowels are specific for the darker areas.</p>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_BEGIN-->\n<p>(The <em>Kajkavian</em> sound clips are provided by a speaker from a village in the darker shaded area.)</p>\n<!--@REMOVE_SOUND_END-->\n<p><em>Kajkavian</em> dialects have many interesting features and they could be considered a language on their own (actually, most dialects in Croatia can be considered languages – the difference is only in their social and political status; such issues will be explored later). Only a small number of these features appear in Zagreb speech today.</p>\n<p>The first feature is, of course, the word <b class=\"hrv\">kaj</b> <i>what</i>, and words derived from it:</p>\n<table class=\"wordlist\"><tr><td>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ne<b class=\"hrvc\">kaj</b></b> <i>something</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">ni<b class=\"hrvc\">kaj</b></b> <i>nothing</i>\n</td><td class=\"last\">\n<b class=\"hrv\">za<b class=\"hrvc\">kaj</b></b> <i>why</i>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Another characteristic common in Zagreb today is the negative present tense of the verb <b class=\"hrv\">moći</b> (...) <i>can</i>; instead of e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">ne može</b>, it’s only one word: <em>pres-3</em> is <b class=\"hrv\">nemre</b>, and it changes like a regular verb!</p>\n<p>Then, the future tense is formed with the present of the verb (<b class=\"hrv\">bude</b>) and the <em>past</em> form of the verb, but the verb (<b class=\"hrv\">bude</b>) has additional, shortened present tense forms. This table lists both verbs in the present tense:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\" rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">    (<b class=\"hrv\">bude</b>)</th>\n<th> </th>\n<th class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">      <b class=\"hrv\">ne</b> + <b class=\"hrv\">moći</b> (...)</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<th>sing.</th>\n<th>plur.</th>\n<th> </th>\n<th>sing.</th>\n<th class=\"last\">plur.</th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">1st</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">bum</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">bumo</b></td>\n<td> </td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nemrem</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">nemremo</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">2nd</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">buš</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">bute</b></td>\n<td> </td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nemreš</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">nemrete</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\">3rd</td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">bu</b></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">bu<b class=\"hrvc\">ju</b></b></td>\n<td> </td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">nemre</b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">nemre<b class=\"hrvc\">ju</b></b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The <em>pres-3pl</em> ending of these verbs is <b class=\"hrv\">-eju</b>, compared to standard Croatian <b class=\"hrv\">-u</b>. This applies to other verbs with <em>pres-3</em> in <b class=\"hrv\">-e</b> as well.</p>\n<p>Also, the <em>past-m</em> forms have simpler forms, only in <b class=\"hrv\">-l</b> (or <b class=\"hrv\">-el</b>, after a consonant):</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr>\n<th class=\"first\">verb</th>\n<th><em>past-m</em></th>\n<th class=\"last\"><em>past-f</em></th>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>watch</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">gleda<b class=\"hrvc\">l</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">gledala</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"first\"><i>think</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">misli<b class=\"hrvc\">l</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">mislila</b></td>\n</tr><tr class=\"separ\">\n<td class=\"first\"><i>say</i></td>\n<td><b class=\"hrv\">rek<b class=\"hrvc\">el</b></b></td>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">rekla</b></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>These are characteristic features in speech in Zagreb; some are very common, others are rare today; not all of them are generally <em>Kajkavian</em>:</p>\n<table class=\"nice\"><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">\nused always<br/>\n    ↑<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/><br/>\n<br/>\n    ↓<br/>\nvery rare\n</td><td class=\"last\">‘western pronunciation’</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"last\"><b class=\"hrv\">di</b> <i>where</i><br/>\n<b class=\"hrv\">kaj</b> <i>what</i>, <b class=\"hrv\">zakaj</b> <i>why</i>...<br/>\nspecific negative <em>pres-3</em> of <i>can</i>: <b class=\"hrv\">nemre</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"last\">forms <b class=\"hrv\">bum</b>, <b class=\"hrv\">buš</b>...</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"last\"><em>past-m</em> forms in <b class=\"hrv\">-l</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"last\">specific forms, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">zeti</b> (<b class=\"hrv\">zeme</b>) perf. <i>take</i>, I <b class=\"hrv\">menom</b></td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td class=\"last\">Ekavian forms, e.g. <b class=\"hrv\">deca</b> <i>children</i></td>\n</tr></table>\n<p>The language spoken in Rijeka, the third biggest city in Croatia, is similar to Zagreb in many aspects. The following features are common to both Zagreb and Rijeka, and can be called ‘western pronunciation’:</p>\n<p>1. Use of ‘<em>western stress</em>’. For instance, the verb <b class=\"hrv\">d<u>o</u>l<u>a</u>ziti</b> will be stressed on the second syllable.</p>\n<p>2. No distinction in <em>pronunciation</em> of <b class=\"hrv\">č</b> vs. <b class=\"hrv\">ć</b> and <b class=\"hrv\">đ</b> vs. <b class=\"hrv\">dž</b>, and no distinction in vowel length.</p>\n<p>3. <em>Infinitives</em> without the final <b class=\"hrv\">-i</b> all the time.</p>\n<p>4. <em>Yes/no questions</em> where unstressed forms are used as stressed, and simply put at the first position:</p>\n<div class=\"primj\"><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">Si</b> ga vidio?</b> <i>Did you see him?</i>\n</p><p>\n<b class=\"hrv\">— <b class=\"hrvc\">Se</b> bojiš?</b> <i>Are you afraid?</i>\n</p></div>\n<p>The Standard Croatian stressed form of <b class=\"hrv\">si</b> is <b class=\"hrv\">jesi</b>, while the particle <b class=\"hrv\">se</b>² cannot be used like that in Standard Croatian at all!</p>\n<p>5. There are some <em>specific words</em> often used in both Zagreb and Rijeka, for example (the standard form is on the right):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrvc\">di</b> <i>where</i> :: <b class=\"hrv\">gdje</b>\n</p>\n<p><em>Adverbs ending in a vowel without the final vowel</em>. Besides examples like <b class=\"hrv\">sad</b> / <b class=\"hrv\">sada</b>, found in many places, there will be words like (Standard forms are on the right):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrvc\">ak</b> <i>if</i> :: <b class=\"hrv\">ako</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">kak</b> <i>how</i> :: <b class=\"hrv\">kako</b><br/>\n<b class=\"hrvc\">tak</b> <i>so</i> :: <b class=\"hrv\">tako</b><br/>\n</p>\n<p>Specific words (some of them are common in certain other regions as well):</p>\n<p class=\"wordlist\">\n<b class=\"hrvc\">niš</b> <i>nothing</i> :: <b class=\"hrv\">ništa</b><br/>\n</p>\n<p>(the rest is coming soon...)</p>\n<!--##EXAMPLE##-->\n<p class=\"expand\"><a onclick='ShowHide(\"example_i4\", \"Examples\")'>\n<span id=\"example_i4_ctrl\">↓ Examples (click to show)</span></a></p>\n<div id=\"example_i4\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<p>This book features the verb form <b class=\"hrv\">nemreš</b> <i>you can’t</i>, characteristic for Zagreb and surrounding areas:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_Nemres_bit_pametan.jpg\" title=\"Nemreš bit pametan\"/></p>\n<p>Also, the infinitive <b class=\"hrv\">biti</b> <i>be</i> is colloquially shortened, which is, of course, not specific for Zagreb.</p>\n<p>This local souvenir shop in Rijeka is named after a phrase characteristic for Rijeka, <b class=\"hrv\">šta da</b>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://sites.google.com/site/easycroat/images/EC_StaDa.jpg\" title=\"šta da?!\"/></p>\n</div>\n<!--##EXAMPLE_END##-->\n<!--\n\n    kolko \"how much\", tolko \"so much\", etc. {koliko etc.}\n    kaj \"what\" and its derivatives: nikaj \"nothing\", nekaj \"something\", etc.\n    niš \"nothing\"\n    verb nemrem \"can not\"\n    bum as perfective counterpart of sam, si, used for forming futures with past participles\n    weakening of final consonants\n    the \"Final L Rule\" turned off: past participles like pisal, vozil etc., words like posel \"job\"\n    ins. menom vs. Standard mnom (from ja)\n    Kajkavian 3rd pers. pl. in the present tense: učiju, voziju \n\nThe last group of features is seldom encountered nowadays and used mostly by older people:\n\n    ekavian words: lep, bel, dete\n    kajkavian declension in nouns\n    many German loans\n    specific prepositions, prefixes and forms: zemem perf. \"take\", dojdem perf. \"arrive, come\"\n    specific Kajkavian words: furt \"always\", prav \"true\"\n    specific politeness, e.g. prosim \"please\"\n    preference on using diminutives\n    Kajkavian e in place of Standard ä: megla, steklo, pes \n\nSome examples (all taken from the Internet)\n\n    Kam ideš?
