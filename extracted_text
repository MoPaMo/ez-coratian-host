Introduction
This is a simple introduction to the Croatian language, where you can learn the very
basics easily. (At least I hope so.)
It’s currently under construction: some parts are completed, some are not even
started.
Two warnings. First, I’m not a professional language teacher or linguist. Second,
English is not my native tongue so you will probably find some bad English in this
‘course’. Feel free to correct me.
If you’re an expert in Croatian, or have read some book with very detailed
descriptions of Croatian grammar, etc. and want to ask me why something is not
described here, please bear in mind that this ‘course’ is intentionally lightweight and
focuses on performance and not learning all the details and formal rules.
What is Croatian? There’s no single answer. Strictly speaking, ‘languages’ are a kind
of abstractions and oversimplifications. There’s language on the public TV, but
there’s also language on the streets, in movies, books and songs. People in Croatia
don’t speak a ‘monolithic’ language, despite being portrayed so in many
introductory, and even advanced texts. There’s a lot of regional variation, and in
some parts of Croatia, extraordinary local diversity is found. This affects not only
the language spoken at home, but also how people talk in public, certain words and
grammar rules. I will attempt to give at least an overview of all such variations:
places of significant variation within Croatia will be marked with a ® mark, and
explained at the end of each chapter.
In this work, I’ll use ‘Croatian’ as ‘what is most common in use in Croatia’, especially
in in everyday communication, e.g. at work, at university, in shops, at least in bigger
cities, that is, how most people today speak (which is not uniform, as you will
immediately see).
It turns out that the language most people in Croatia use is very close to what
people in Bosnia-Herzegovina use, and quite similar to what many people in Serbia
use. There are no sharp lines between Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian (defined as
how people actually speak in these countries). Actually, the diversity within Croatia
is much greater than e.g. difference between the standard languages you can hear
on Croatian and Serbian public TV.
However, this means if you’re really interested in Bosnian or Serbian, this ‘course’
could be very useful to you; differences are small and I will summarize them at the
end. Through this ‘course’, all important differences are marked: words that are
really different are also marked with a ® mark, and such differences are explained at
the end of each chapter. What applies to Bosnian, usually applies to Montenegrin as
well. If you are interested in Croatian only, simply ignore such remarks.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / Introduc!on
6 / 600

Some might ask: why is this, then, only ‘Croatian’, and not ‘Bosnian, Croatian,
Montenegrin and Serbian’? There are two reasons: first, I happen to live in Croatia,
so I know the actual speech and language in Croatia much better than in the 3 other
countries; second, that would imply treating them on equal footing, i.e. giving many
examples in three or four versions, including Serbian Cyrillic spelling from the start,
and so on. Everything would get really complicated then. However, Bosnian,
Croatian, Serbian books by Ronelle Alexander do exactly that – you should check
them if you like such an approach.
In Croatia, there are various manuals with rules for ‘standard’, ‘proper’ language.
Not of them agree what is ‘standard’, and what is not. This ‘course’ will focus
primarily on the everyday language: sometimes, there's a difference between formal
(or ‘standard’) and everyday (‘colloquial’) words and forms, which are used in almost
all circumstances, except in laws and textbooks. Such differences will be explained
as well.
Depending on your background, you might find some features of Croatian a bit
strange. For example, while English apple shows a simple variation (apple, apples)
the Croatian jabuka has more forms (jabuka, jabuku, jabuci, jabukom, jabuko,
jabuke, jabukama). Such forms will be introduced gradually, starting from more
often used forms. Knowing any language beside English is really useful, since English
is one of European languages most unlike Croatian. I’ve added examples in German,
French, Italian, Spanish and Swedish at various places, since they are more similar to
Croatian.
Each chapter supposes that you have mastered all previous chapters. The aim of this
‘course’ is to enable you to produce and understand as many useful sentences as
possible with the minimal knowledge of grammar.
Chapters 1-9 will introduce you to the very basics: alphabet, present tense, how to
use nouns as objects. You’ll be able to say Ana is driving Goran to school, It’s warm
today, My name is Ivan, The bus to Zadar is leaving tomorrow at three o’clock, and
much more.
Chapters 10-19 will introduce you to gender in Croatian, use of adjectives, and
useful words like this, that, my, your; you’ll be able to say Ana’s book is in this
drawer, We’re eating in an expensive restaurant, and much more.
Chapters 20-29 will introduce you to plural of nouns, adjectives and verbs, ways of
expressing what you feel (e.g. I’m quite cold), expressions like car keys, my sister’s
friend, past tense, use of pronouns (I saw her), and more.
Chapters 30-39 will introduce you to more forms, ordinal numbers (first, second),
more types of questions, expressing tools, company, conditional and polite
expressions (e.g. I would like...) and more.
Chapters 40-49 will introduce you to measuring, counting things, expressing
existence, future tense, expressing how long actions were, and ways to express
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / Introduc!on

accomplishments.
Chapter 50 and later will introduce you to various kinds of sentences and ways to
communicate in various situations.
A small Core Dictionary is attached to this course. It currently contains about 1800
entries, with about 2900 most used words.
Since April 2016, all recent updates in offline versions (Kindle and PDF) are marked
with a pale blue stripe on the right margin (like this paragraph) to draw attention to
recent changes and added information. This does not apply to Exercises and
Examples, or to the Core Dictionary, only to the main text.
I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have helped me: my wife for
sound clips, Blaženka for additional sound clips; Boban Arsenijević for drawing the
boundary of the standard stress area in Serbia, Dušica Božović for details on
language in Serbia, CJ for many ideas and comments, Conor O’Neill for fixing my
English, Аня Немова for drawing my attention to parts of grammar I’ve overlooked,
Viviam for many comments and comparisons with Brazilian Portuguese, and many
others who helped me improve this work.

Happy learning!

01 Alphabet and Pronunciation
Croatian alphabet is simpler than English and much more similar to German or
Spanish.
Letters b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, z are pronounced more or less as in English.
The letter g is pronounced always as in English go or get.
The following letters have a special pronunciation in Croatian:
Specific letters in Croatian
c
as tz in tzar
č
as ch in child
ć
similar to č, a bit ‘softer’
đ
as j in joke
j
as y in you
š
as sh in ship
ž
as s in pleasure
Sequences of letters dž, lj and nj are considered single letters in Croatian; they are
pronounced as follows:
Specific two-letter sequences
dž
similar to đ, a bit ‘harder’
lj
like an l fused with a j
as Italian gl (e.g. in figlia)
or like English million
nj
like an n fused with a j 
like Spanish ñ (e.g. in señor)
or Italian gn (e.g. in bagno)
or like English onion
The 7 letters listed above (c to ž) and these two-letter sequences are Croatian-
specific letters and have a somewhat special role in grammar. (You can remember
them as consonants having ‘hooks’ on them, including j, having a ‘dot’ + letter c.)
Croatian vowels are quite different than English vowels: they should be pronounced
as Spanish or Italian vowels, as rather ‘flat’. Vowels can be either long or short
(similar to English fit vs. feet) but in some cities (notably, Zagreb, Rijeka and Pula)
that distinction is lost.
Therefore, I have decided not to mark long vowels, as it would be too complicated
for beginners: the rules are really complex and not respected in real life in many
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 01 Alphabet and Pronuncia!on
9 / 600

parts of Croatia anyway.
Also, most people in Croatia pronounce today ć the same as č, and dž the same as
đ. This feature includes most cities.
In the Standard pronunciation of č and dž, the tip of tongue is pressed against the
palate (top of the mouth) right above teeth, the teeth are separated, and there’s a
gap between lips and teeth; it’s called apical pronunciation.
There’s a vowel ə (pronounced as e in English the) that’s never spelled; it appears in
the following situations:
1. in seemingly impossible words like čvrst rigid, hard and krv blood: they can be
approximately pronounced with the vowel ə (at least by some Croatian speakers)
as čvərst and kərv. Actually, krv is pronounced a bit like English curve.
2. the same goes for e.g. bicikl bicycle, which is rather pronounced as bi-ci-kəl (three
syllables).
3. when talking about letters, Croatians often talk about the letter "b", and
pronounce its ‘name’ as bə.
Although words should be pronounced as spelled, a great majority of Croatians
pronounce the sequence ije (when not at the end of the word) as just je, for
example:
lijepo beautifully is usually pronounced as lje-po
prije before is pronounced as written (pri-je), since the ije comes at the very end
Some people pronounce lijepo as l-j-e-p-o (that is, l and j are separate sounds; this
is regarded as standard), others as lj-e-p-o. To help you with the pronunciation, I’ve
marked such normally written, but not pronounced i’s like this: lijepo. In the words
like prije, where all vowels are normally pronounced, nothing is marked.
There are very few other situations where something is written but not pronounced
in Croatian, they will be specially emphasized.
Croatian spells the foreign names and places how they are originally spelled, if the
original spelling uses the Latin script (e.g. New York, Chuck Norris), while in
sometimes in Bosnian, and as the rule in Serbian, respelling according to an
approximate pronunciation is used (Njujork, Čak Noris).
Stress (pronouncing one syllable a bit louder, as in English together) has quite
complex rules and varies in colloquial speech in different parts of Croatia. Stress is
never indicated in writing (similar to the practice in English, but unlike Spanish or
Italian), and you are simply supposed to know it.
There are two common ways (or schemes) of stressing words used in speech:
The standard stress is used in the Standard Croatian, and in cities of Split, Osijek,
Dubrovnik, and surrounding countryside; the area extends to Bosnia, and most of
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 01 Alphabet and Pronuncia!on
10 / 600

Serbia. This is what you hear on the Croatian Public Radio and TV (this is the
pronunciation you will find in language manuals and good dictionaries).
Furthermore, the Standard Croatian has two kinds of stress (ways that one syllable
in the word can be stressed): with the rising tone and the falling tone. It’s a bit
similar to tones in Swedish or even Chinese. The stress in the Standard Croatian is
virtually identical to stress in the Standard Serbian or Bosnian, but many people in
Croatia don’t use standard stress in everyday communication. Furthermore, rules
governing standard stress are very complex (the stress changes in various forms of
one word) so I think it would be too complex to introduce tones in a course
intended for beginners (this approach is followed by most language schools that
offer Croatian; I will describe details later, in A9 Stress).
Therefore, I decided just to mark what vowel is stressed, when the stress is not on
the first syllable (that’s the default place of stress). This map shows roughly (the
shaded area) where the standard stress scheme (or something quite similar to it)
prevails in Croatia and neighboring countries, at least in public settings:
The ‘western stress’ is used colloquially, very often heard in Zagreb, surrounding
areas and some other cities, including Rijeka and Pula. You can hear it on local radio
stations. This is the pronunciation I personally use in everyday life, at work, in
school, etc. (It’s sometimes, confusingly, called ‘urban stress’; you will find virtually
nothing about it in textbooks.)
There are more stress schemes and ways to pronounce words in various dialects,
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 01 Alphabet and Pronuncia!on
11 / 600

but they are more or less limited to small areas and villages. They will be briefly
described in the section on dialects.
I won’t describe the stress schemes used in unshaded areas of Serbia and
Montenegro. For some words, they are a very similar or identical to the ‘western’
stress, for others, quite different.
I will also mark the stressed vowel in the ‘western’ stress, when it’s different from
the standard stress position. For many words, there’s little or no difference, and for
others, there’s an obvious difference, as demonstrated with words ponekad
sometimes and kolač cake (I have underlined the stressed vowels):
word
standard
‘western’
ponekad
ponekad
ponekad
kolač
kolač
kolač
As you can see, some people pronounce the words ponekad and kolač with the
stress on the first syllable, and some others with the stress on the second syllable.
You would never know it from the normal spelling, since stress is normally not
marked.
Therefore, I marked the word ponekad and similar ones with two stress positions
(that is, I have underlined two vowels). The first mark (from left) is always the
standard position and the second mark (if indicated) the ‘western’ stress position.
  the first mark (if present):
  standard stress
  
  the second mark (if present):
  ‘western’ stress
  
 
 
ponekad
The word kolač and many others are marked in the same way. (Such markings are
my invention. There are also standard stress symbols, but they are quite
complicated and used only in specialized books. You can find more in Wikipedia and
elsewhere.)
Bear in mind, if nothing is marked, the word is stressed on the first syllable. If there’s
only one mark, practically everyone pronounces the stress on the same syllable.
There are a few words where the standard stress is not on the first syllable, but the
‘western’ stress is; one of them is the word for binoculars:
standard: dalekozor
‘western’: dalekozor
=   dalekozorʷ¹
For such words, I’ll underscore the standard stress position, and write in small
superscript letters ‘W1’ after the word (i.e. ‘western’ stress on the 1st syllable), as
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 01 Alphabet and Pronuncia!on
12 / 600

shown above.
A suggestion. I have to admit, the standard stress scheme is quite complicated,
even in my watered-down version. Try learning the standard stress scheme only if
you want to speak roughly as news presenters on Croatian Public TV, or you
really want to imitate speech from the shaded area. Otherwise, don’t bother with
it, and go for the ‘western’ scheme. You’ll sound roughly like someone from the
unshaded regions, which is not bad if your main goal is to communicate. Keep in
mind, stress is not marked in normal writing at all.
There are only couple of words that differ only by their stress, for example:
frizer freezer
frizer hairdresser
(Again, pay attention that both marks, for stress, and for i’s usually not pronounced
are just my inventions: nobody uses them in writing.)

02 Simplest Sentences
The simplest sentences are of type Ana is sleeping or Ivan is running. Such sentences
are in the present tense and in the 3rd person.
To make them in Croatian, you need the 3rd person present tense form or the verb
(I’ll call it pres-3 for short).
(Verbs are words that mean an action or state, like listen, wait, eat, sit.)
Verbs are normally listed in Croatian dictionaries in the so-called infinitive form (inf
for short). For most verbs, you just need to remove the ending -ti and you have the
form you need now. For instance, let’s take these verbs right from a dictionary:
čitati read
kuhati cook ®
pjevati sing ®
raditi work
plivati swim
spavati sleep
učiti learn, study
voziti drive
It’s very easy to make simple sentences like the following:
Ana čita. Ana is reading.
Marko kuha. Marko is cooking.
Ivana spava. Ivana is sleeping.
Goran uči. Goran is studying.
Here one Croatian word (e.g. čita) really corresponds to two English words (e.g. is
reading). Croatian present tense is just one word.
If you are new to learning languages, a warning: in very few instances you can
just translate from English word-for-word and get a meaningful sentence in
another language. For example, these two sentences in English have three words
each and differ in only one word:
I am cooking.
I like cooking.
However, the matching sentences in Croatian have 1 word and 2 words
respectively – and no words in common. Croatian, generally, uses less words than
English in an average sentence.
If you’re now asking why the verb čitati has the first vowel underlined, if the default
stress is on the first syllable anyway (e.g. voziti is stressed on the first syllable
without any special mark), be patient: you will get the answer in the following
chapters.
There are few verbs where you need to change the last vowel in the present tense,
from a to i. One of them is:
trčati run → trči
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 02 Simplest Sentences
14 / 600

trčati
ležati
jesti
pisati
plesati
plakati
jesti
plakati
plakati
If the pres-3 form is not straightforward, I’ll list it after the infinitive form of a verb,
in parentheses. A good Croatian dictionary should list it too:
ležati (leži) lie down, recline
trčati (trči) run
To help you remember all verbs where pres-3 and other present tense forms are
not simply derived by removing -ti from the inf, such present tense forms will be
underlined with a blue line, and the inf forms will be printed on the right margin in
pale blue. For example:
Ana trči. Ana is running.
Marko leži. Marko is lying.
There are more verbs where you have to remember the present form, but it’s not a
simple change of a vowel; it again should be listed in a dictionary (you can call such
verbs ‘irregular’). For such verbs, the pres-3 form almost always ends in -e:
jesti (jede) eat
pisati (piše) write
piti (pije) drink
plakati (plače) cry
plesati (pleše) dance ®
skakati (skače) jump
(Recall that in words like pije, ije is pronounced as two syllables, since it comes at
the very end: pi-je.) Let’s put these forms to use:
Ana jede. Ana is eating.
Marko piše. Marko is writing.
Ivana pleše. Ivana is dancing.
Goran plače. Goran is crying.
Instead of names, you can use the following pronouns:
on he
ona she
For example:
Ona jede. She’s eating.
On plače. He’s crying.
You can even leave out the pronoun if it’s obvious who you’re talking about:
Plače. He/she is crying.
That’s fine, but how do you say I’m eating or I’m cooking? Such sentences are in the
1st person. Croatian does not use personal pronouns (I, you...) often, the preferred
way is just to use a special verb form. (This is actually common in most languages:
English, German and French obligatory pronoun is an exception, from the standpoint
of the majority of languages in the world.)
It turns out that for almost all verbs, you just need to add an -m to the pres-3 form
to get the pres-1 form you now need:
Čitam. I’m reading.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 02 Simplest Sentences
15 / 600

jesti
pisati
plesati
piti
plakati
plesati
Kuham. I’m cooking.
Učim. I’m studying.
(This is also possible in English, but only colloquially, e.g. hope this helps. However,
the sentences above are not considered colloquial at all in Croatian! Croatian simply
uses pronouns only in specific circumstances, which will be described later.)
This works regardless of the verbs being ‘irregular’ or not:
Jedem. I’m eating.
Pišem. I’m writing.
Plešem. I’m dancing.
Pijem. I’m drinking.
Since pijem is derived from pije, the pronunciation of ije is the same as in pije – it’s
pronounced clearly as two syllables: pi-jem. This holds to all similar verbs as well. ®
A Croatian dictionary could list either pres-3 forms or pres-1 forms for the ‘irregular’
verbs, but it’s easy to distinguish them, since they end in different letters (almost all
pres-1 forms end in an -m: for just two irregular verbs they end in -u).
We can introduce two useful words to add information to such sentences (they are
both adverbs):
još still
već already
We can put them in front of the verb to say that something is still ongoing or it has
already started:
Ana već spava. Ana is already sleeping.
Goran još plače. Goran is still crying.
The adverb još, when used in this role, is often emphasized as još uvijek, giving it a
bit stronger meaning:
Ana još uvijek pleše. Ana is still dancing.
This is a bit colloquial. It’s usually pronounced as u-vjek, since the ije does not
appear at the very end (and so I marked it).
If you’re now asking how to say I write or Ana sleeps, there’s no such difference in
Croatian: pišem means both I’m writing and I write.
If a verb has an irregular pres-3, please learn the inf as well, even if you don’t need it
right now: you’ll need it a bit later, for the past and the future tense.
________
® In most of Serbia, and in the prevailing variant of Standard Serbian, most words
that have -ije- or -je- in Croatian, have -e- instead, e.g. instead of pjevati, the verb is
pevati. That’s called “Ekavian pronunciation” (the name is misleading – it’s not just a
matter of pronunciation, since spelling follows the pronunciation).
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 02 Simplest Sentences
16 / 600

However, forms like pjevati, called “Ijekavian” are also standard in Serbian (as
another standard variant) and you can occasionally read articles written in
“Ijekavian” in newspapers from Serbia. I will not mark all such words. In most cases,
if you want to obtain them, just replace -ije- or -je- in Croatian with -e-. Exceptions
will be marked: one of them are present forms of the verb piti, which are pijem, pije
also in Serbia. You can find more about “Ekavian” in A9 Bosnian, Serbian and
Montenegrin.
In most coastal areas of Croatia, but not in the very south (i.e. Dubrovnik area) most
words that have -ije- or -je- in Standard Croatian, have -i- instead, e.g. instead of
pjevati, the verb is pivati. That’s called “Ikavian pronunciation”. You will find it in
casual writing, some novels, movies and pop songs.
Instead of kuhati, the form kuvati is used in Serbia, and in parts of Bosnia and
Croatia (however, it’s not standard in Croatian).
In Serbia, meaning dance is usually expressed with the verb igrati which has other
meanings (play) in both Croatia and Serbia.
• Something Possibly Interesting
English is a distant cousin to Croatian and related languages. This will mostly be of
interest to language geeks. However, it can also help you remember things.
For example, the -m in the Croatian 1st person is related to the English I am —
thousands of years ago, a long lost language which was the common ancestor of
both languages had the -m in the first person form of some verbs. This consonant
has survived literally thousands of years.
Russian is a much closer cousin. For example, Russian verb meaning write has inf
писать, and the pres-3 пишет. If we would spell these words using Croatian
characters, it would be p’isаt’ (p’išet), which is almost identical to Croatian.
However, the pres-1 is p’išu. Russian has overall a bit more complex forms of words
when compared to Croatian.

It’s nice to be able to say Ana is reading or I’m cooking, but it would be even better
to be able to say what you are reading or cooking!
Croatian is a language with grammatical cases. It means that words change a bit
when used in sentences. For instance, when you express what you are reading or
even whom you’re waiting for – that’s called object. This ‘role’ requires a form of a
noun that’s usually called accusative case or sometimes the object case. Since
accusative is a long word, it’s often shortened to just A.
(Nouns are words standing for a more or less specific object, person or idea,
something that can perform an action, e.g. sister, cat, or can be an object of an
action, e.g. you can eat a pizza).
Not all nouns change in accusative in the same way. Some don’t change at all. A
large group of nouns in Croatian end in -a; they all change that ending to -u in
accusative. For instance:
baka grandmother
jabuka apple
juha soup ®
kava coffee ®
knjiga book
mama Mom
pjesma song
riba fish
sestra sister
tata Dad
teta aunt
televizija TV ®
večera supper, late dinner
voda water
The default, ‘dictionary’ forms listed above are also considered a ‘grammatical case’
and are called nominative (just N for short).
We are now able to say:
Ana čita knjigu. Ana is reading a book.
Kuham juhu. I’m cooking soup.
Ivan pije kavu. Ivan is drinking coffee.
Jedem večeru. I’m eating supper.
Pijem vodu. I’m drinking water.
Warning. English prefers using ‘light’ or ‘generic’ verbs like make in many
circumstances, so you usually make coffee, make dinner and so on. Croatian has
almost no such verbs, and you have to use always specific verbs – for example,
kuhati cook if you prepare food or drink by cooking.

jesti
In sentences like Ana čita knjigu, the word Ana is called subject. So, the Croatian N
case is sometimes called the subject case:
subject
↓
 
 
object
↓
Ana  čita   knjigu.
N
A
In English, the word order is almost always subject-verb-object. It’s also the most
common order in Croatian, but it’s not always so, as you’ll see later.
If you are now puzzled where the English a (in a book) got lost – it does not exist in
Croatian, there’s no difference between a book and the book in Croatian. (I’ll show
later how you can express a or the if you really need it.)
The majority of verbs require just objects in accusative. For instance:
čekati wait
gledati watch
imati have, possess
slušati listen
tražiti search, look for
trebati need
Let’s put them to use:
Ana gleda televiziju. Ana is watching TV.
Trebam kavu. I need coffee. ®
Ivan čeka baku. Ivan is waiting for his grandmother.
Slušam pjesmu. I’m listening to a song.
Goran traži knjigu. Goran is looking for the book.
Unlike the English verb have, Croatian imati is a perfectly regular and simple verb:
Ivan ima knjigu. Ivan has a book.
While in English, verbs listen and wait use prepositions to and for (you wait for
something), in Croatian no such special words are needed, you just use nouns in
accusative. The same goes for tražiti.
You could also see that in English we have his grandmother while in Croatian it’s just
baka (in A). Words like his, my, her are less used in Croatian and are often implied.
(English also implies possession in some circumstances: it’s enough to say I’m at
home – it’s implied that you’re at your home, not at home that belongs to someone
else. When it’s somebody else’s home, then you would say e.g. I’m at your home.)
This change of ending applies to loanwords (that is, words taken from other
languages) as well:
Goran jede pizzu. Goran is eating a pizza.
There are also a few words that must adapt in English as well, depending on their
role: you cannot say “I’m listening to she”, but I’m listening to her. It’s just that in
Croatian, basically all nouns must adapt.

The accusative change -a → -u applies to personal names as well:
Ivan čeka Anu. Ivan is waiting for Ana.
Goran sluša Ivanu. Goran is listening to Ivana.
Therefore, personal names in Croatian have many forms, as other nouns do, and
some of these forms may coincide with other names – as you will later discover.
However, there’s always the base, default form – e.g. Ana and Ivana.
Most personal names that end in -a in Croatian are female names. However, there
are couple of male names that end in -a as well, e.g. Jakša, Luka, Nikola and Saša.
They behave exactly the same:
Ana traži Luku. Ana is looking for Luka.
There are few Croatian female names that don’t end in -a: they don’t change at all,
ever. Such names are e.g. Ines and Nives. For example:
Ivan čeka Ines. Ivan is waiting for Ines.
A more exhaustive list of various names, including male names in -a and female
names not in -a, can be found in L1 Common Names. ®
(I’ll explain you how to use nouns not ending in -a, including masculine names like
Ivan, as objects in the following chapters.)
Finally, I’ll explain how to ask what someone is doing (at the moment, or generally).
While English has the special verb do, Croatian uses the verb raditi work in a generic
sense. You should start such questions with the word što what:
Što Ana radi? What is Ana doing? (lit. ‘working’)
— Gleda televiziju. She’s watching TV.
As you can see, there’s nothing special about questions in Croatian: no special word
order, no special rules. You just have to start them with the right question-word. I’ve
also given the literal (lit.) meaning, in quotes; of course, it really means what is
doing.
We can here answer only with a verb, no pronouns (e.g. ona she) are needed, since
it’s clear who we’re talking about. Generally, Croatian prefers very short answers.
To ask directly what someone is doing, use the 2nd person form radiš:
Što radiš? What are you doing? (to a single person!)
— Čitam knjigu. I’m reading a book.
This form is used only when you ask a single person, someone you’re familiar with,
your family member, co-worker, etc; for your superiors, people you don’t know
personally, other forms are used (they will be explained later).
In many regions, šta is used colloquially instead of što®, so you’ll very often read and
hear šta radiš, etc. (try it with Google™).

One more remark: there are other languages out there that have grammatical cases,
and call one of them accusative, e.g. Finnish, German, Greek, Latin and so on. The
accusative case in all languages tends to be similar, but details can be different. If
you know a lot how to use the accusative case in e.g. German, be aware that not all
of it applies to Croatian.
________
® Instead of kava, a slightly different word kafa is common in most parts of Bosnia
and Serbia. In Bosnia, the form kahva is used as well. Instead of juha, supa is
common in these countries, and in some regions of Croatia as well.
Standard Serbian insists that the word for TV must be stressed as televizija (you will
hear it on the Serbian Public TV); regardless of it, a great majority of speakers in
Serbia uses the same stress in that word as in Croatia. However, you will
occasionally hear televizija in parts of Croatia and Bosnia.
While many names are common in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, there
are some country-specific names. Actually, there are some names that are specific
for a part of Croatia, and uncommon elsewhere – despite the total population of
Croatia being about 4 millions.
The form šta what is considered standard in Serbia, Montenegro and most of
Bosnia. It’s very common in Croatia (including the cities of Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, etc)
but not standard. In Northwestern Croatia, many people colloquially use kaj for
what (you can hear it in Zagreb too). In parts of the coast, especially islands and
Istria, another word is often used colloquially for what: ča.
• Something Possibly Interesting
If we would pay attention to tones in words, object forms of some words would be
a bit more complicated to create. For instance, the noun voda water has the rising
tone in the nominative case, but the falling tone in the accusative vodu. However,
the noun riba fish has the falling tone in all forms. This is not a major issue, since
many people in Croatia have no differences in tone, or have non-standard tones
anyway, so we’re used various ‘accents’.
In Russian, this is a major issue. There are no tones in Russian, but the stress often
moves in various forms of one word. For instance, Russian water is N вода, A воду.
When written in Croatian spelling, it’s N vodа, A vodu – which seems identical to
Croatian, but there’s a catch: since the o in N is unstressed, it’s pronounced reduced,
much closer to the a sound, while in A it’s stressed and pronounced like o! Russian
pronunciation is more complex than Croatian.

04 No, Often, Probably and Again
We now know how to say Ana is watching TV, but how to say Ana isn't watching TV?
It is quite simple: just put a word ne¨ right before the verb. This is the default and
main way to make negation in Croatian (in English, you can also put no right in front
of a noun, e.g. I need no coffee, but it does not work in Croatian):
Ana ne gleda televiziju. Ana isn’t watching TV.
Ne trebam kavu. I don’t need coffee.
According to the Standard pronunciation, the word ne¨ is pronounced together with
the verb that follows it, and for many verbs – but not for all – the ne¨ gets stressed
instead of the verb. That almost never happens in the ‘western’ pronunciation,
where the stress almost never moves in such circumstances. We could therefore
write the above combination as ne-gleda.
If you want to follow the Standard stress scheme, how to find out if the stress
moves to ne¨ or not? Just look if the verb has (in my markings!) any underline. This
explains why I have underlined the first syllables of some verbs:
Standard stress when ne¨ is before a verb
ne + gleda
the stress moves to ne
ne + čita
no shift: the stress stays on či
ne + razgovara
no shift: the stress stays on go
In the ‘western’ scheme, which is much simpler, the stress doesn’t even move from
gleda. It that scheme, it moves mostly from the very short verbs, like znati know,
and there’s only few of them. In the city of Rijeka and the region around it, the
stress usually doesn’t move, even from such short verbs.
The two dots (¨) after the ne¨ are just a reminder that this word must be placed
always right before the verb, and that it gets pronounced together with the verb;
they are just my markings, of course they are not normally written, please don’t
write them when you write in Croatian.
The verb imati have behaves a bit specially: its present tense forms get always fused
with ne¨ into nema, nemam, etc.:
Nemam čašu. I don’t have a glass.
Croatian has two words that correspond to English glass (to drink from, not what is
used for windows) and cup, and they divide the world a bit differently:
čaša glass, (paper) cup (no handle)
šalica cup, mug (has a handle) ®
Basically, čaša is made of glass or some thin material (e.g. plastic, paper) and šalica
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 04 No, O_en, Probably and Again
24 / 600

piti
piti
is heavy and has a handle.
Back to negative sentences: they can mean that something is not happening right
now or it never happens. If you want to emphasize that something never happens,
you should add the following adverb in the sentence – the most common place is
before the ne¨ – but without removing the negation:
nikad(a) never (use with negation!)
This is different than in English, where you have to remove negation if you use
never. The word can appear as either nikad or nikada, there’s no difference in
meaning and the shorter form is more common in everyday communication (there
are many words in Croatian with this feature). For example:
Ana nikad ne gleda televiziju. Ana never watches TV.
Nikad ne pijem kavu. I never drink coffee.
There are more words like nikad(a) in Croatian: whenever any of them is used, the
verb must be negated. Most of them start with ni-.
There’s another special adverb that emphasizes the negation:
uopće + negation not... at all ®
As in other Croatian words that have vowels without a consonant between, vowels
are pronounced separately. Therefore, the word has three syllables: u-op-će.
(Besides, the word is stressed on the first syllable in the Standard scheme, and on
the second syllable in the ‘western’ scheme.) For example:
Goran uopće ne spava. Goran isn’t sleeping at all.
Futhermore, we can use the following combinations of adverbs and ne¨ to express
that something is over or still didn’t begin:
još + negation not... yet
više + negation not... anymore
For example:
Goran još ne spava. Goran isn’t sleeping yet.
Više ne pijem kavu. I don’t drink coffee anymore.
(It’s not obligatory to put the words nikad(a), uopće, još and više right before ne¨,
that’s just the most frequent position.)
It’s also useful to tell how often something happens. There are following useful
words:
često often
obično usually
ponekad sometimes
rijetko not very often
stalno all the time
svaki dan every day
uvijek always
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 04 No, O_en, Probably and Again
25 / 600

piti
piti
piti
Such words are often placed before the verb, and svaki dan is often found at the
end of the sentence as well. Word order is quite free in Croatian and you can place
many words as you like.
Ana rijetko gleda televiziju. Ana watches TV rarely.
Ponekad pijem kavu. I drink coffee sometimes.
Ivan pije kavu svaki dan. Ivan drinks coffee every day.
There’s another useful word: skoro almost (it has other meanings as well). Used
with nikad(a), it expresses almost never. However, you still have to use negation:
Skoro nikad ne pijem kavu. I almost never drink coffee.
There are more useful words. For example when you say that someone is doing
something, you could be perfectly sure, or just guess. That’s where these words
come into play:
možda maybe
očito obviously
sigurno for sure
vjerojatno probably ®
Such words are again usually put before the verb. For example:
Goran možda spava. Goran is maybe sleeping.
Ivan sigurno pije kavu. Ivan is drinking coffee for sure.
There are couple of words to indicate that something repeats or happens for the
first time:
opet / ponovo / ponovno again
prvi put for the first time
There’s really no difference among the three words meaning again. The word opet
is the most frequent one in everyday life:
Ana opet spava. Ana is sleeping again.
Goran prvi put čita knjigu. Goran is reading a book for the first time.
You will sometimes hear and read prvi puta, e.g. in newspapers. (Some people think
that form is not acceptable as standard, but it can be seen in publications issued by
the Croatian government!) It’s basically the same variation as nikad vs. nikada.
If you are asked what you’re doing, and you aren’t doing anything in particular, you
can answer with:
Što radiš? What are you doing?
— Ništa. Nothing.
If you want to use ništa nothing with a verb, the verb must be negated too:
Ivan često ne radi ništa. Ivan frequently does nothing. (lit. ‘isn’t doing nothing’)
This is again quite unlike English. In English, there’s at most one negation in a
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 04 No, O_en, Probably and Again
26 / 600

sentence; in Croatian, it’s always either all negative – including the verb – or
nothing. The following sentence negates the verb and has two additional negative
words:
Ivan nikad ne radi ništa. Ivan never does anything. (lit. ‘doesn’t never do nothing’)
Such ‘multiple negations’ in Croatian are mandatory.

• Something Possibly Interesting
The word ne¨ is negative. This is not a coincidence: the English word ultimately
comes from Latin, and the prefix ne- in Latin meant negation; Croatian and Latin are
(distant) cousins. This is another detail that can help you remember the Croatian
word.

05 Accusative Case
In the previous chapters you’ve learned how to use nouns that end in -a (in their
dictionary form) as objects, that is, how to make their accusative (object) form (also
called case). But what about other nouns?
First, there are general nouns that end in -o or -e. They usually don’t change at all in
the accusative case, that is, they can be used as objects in their dictionary (or
nominative) form. For instance:
auto car
jutro morning
meso meat
mlijeko milk
nebo sky, skies
more sea 
pismo letter
pivo beer
vino wine
voće fruit, fruits
We can (and must!) use them as objects without any change:
Pijem pivo. I’m drinking beer.
Ana gleda more. Ana is watching the sea.
Goran pije vino. Goran is drinking wine.
Jedem voće. I’m eating fruits.
Ivan pije mlijeko. Ivan is drinking milk.
Pišem pismo. I’m writing a letter.
Ivana vozi auto. Ivana is driving a car.
There are two useful and similar verbs:
vidjeti (vidi) (can) see
voljeti (voli) like, love ®
These two verbs change from -jeti in inf to -i in pres-3. That happens for almost all
verbs in -jeti, and can be considered regular, therefore, I usually won’t list pres-3
forms for such verbs. Some examples:
Vidim more. I (can) see the sea.
Ana voli pivo. Ana likes beer.
Then, there are nouns that end in a consonant (nouns that end in -i or -u are very
rare in Croatian). Their behavior depends on what they stand for. If they stand for
anything except people or animals, they also don’t change in accusative:
brod ship
film movie
kruh bread ®
ručak lunch, dinner
sok juice
vlak train ®
Let’s introduce two more useful verbs:
poznavati (poznaje) know (someone)
rezati (reže) cut
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 05 Accusa!ve Case
28 / 600

rezati
piti
poznavati
Croatian has a special verb for knowing people (and cities), like French connaître.
(Also, this is not an error, the verb poznavati has a different stress in infinitive and
present. Such shifts specific for individual verbs is what makes stress complex in
Croatian.)
Again, we can use the nouns listed above as objects without any change:
Ana gleda film. Ana is watching a movie.
Režem kruh. I’m cutting bread. ®
Goran pije sok. Goran is drinking juice.
Ivana kuha ručak. Ivana is cooking lunch.
Čekam vlak. I’m waiting for a train. ®
However, nouns that end in a consonant, but stand for people or animals do change
in accusative. You must add an -a to them. This applies to e.g. following nouns:
brat brother
čovjek man/human
galeb (sea)gull
konj horse
muž husband
sin son
Let’s put them to use:
Ana gleda konja. Ana is watching a horse.
Ivan čeka brata. Ivan is waiting for his brother.
Goran vidi galeba. Goran sees a seagull.
The accusative ending applies to names as well:
Ana čeka Gorana. Ana is waiting for Goran.
Josip poznaje Ivana. Josip knows Ivan.
This applies to names having more than one word (e.g. with the last name) and to
non-native names as well – each word in the (masculine) name has to get an -a:
Čekamo Ivana Horvata. We’re waiting for Ivan Horvat.
Gledam Brada Pitta. I’m watching Brad Pitt.
When you hear or read a sentence where names are expected to be in the
accusative case, you have to be able to work them back to the default (nominative)
forms. You simply cannot understand Croatian without understanding cases – that’s
why I have introduced them from the start:
Čekam Ivana. I’m waiting for Ivan. (Ivan = male)
Čekam Ivanu. I’m waiting for Ivana. (Ivana = female)
When endings are added to certain nouns ending in a consonant, they don’t get
added to their nominative form, but to a usually slightly different form. One
example is pas dog. In the accusative case, it looks like this:
Ana gleda psa. Ana is watching a dog.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 05 Accusa!ve Case
29 / 600

poznavati
The accusative ending is not added to pas, but to a slightly shorter form (ps). We can
call that form the ‘case-base’ and list it after such nouns, in parentheses:
   
  nominative
 
 
 
 
  ‘case-base’
 
 
                  
 
 
 
 
 
magarac (magarc-) donkey
pas (ps-) dog
vrabac (vrapc-) sparrow
The case-base form has usually just the last syllable shortened, but sometimes
there’s a consonant alternation as well. (This form is also called oblique stem, or just
stem; I’ve invented a simple name for it.)
A few nouns have two possible forms of their case-base. However, the difference is
only in spelling, as in sequences -dc- and -tc-, only -c-; is pronounced. Common ones
are:
sudac (sudc- / suc-) judge
svetac (svetc- / svec-) saint ®
A few male names that end in either -o or -e behave as if they end in a consonant
and have a specific case-base, usually just without the last vowel (j is added if the
word ends in -io):
Darko (Dark-) 
Hrvoje (Hrvoj-) 
Marko (Mark-) 
Dario (Darij-) 
Mario (Marij-) 
Silvio (Silvij-) 
For example:
Ana čeka Marka. Ana is waiting for Marko.
Josip ne poznaje Hrvoja. Josip doesn’t know Hrvoje.
The j is sometimes carried even to the nominative (that is, dictionary) form:
according to the official statistics, there are 32708 Mario’s and 4066 Marijo’s in
Croatia.
Finally, there are common male names that change as if they end in -a. They end in -
e or -o, but that’s just in the nominative case. All other forms are like for nouns in -a.
Such names are historically nicknames. For example, Ante is a nickname for Antun
(corresponding to English Anthony), but it’s used as an official name as well (there
are 35457 Ante’s in Croatia).
Two more names that behave like that are Ivo and Kruno. For a more exhaustive
list, check L1 Common Names.
To mark such strange names, I’ll use (A -u) as a reminder that they change like any
other nouns in -a, i.e. get an -u in the accusative case. For example:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 05 Accusa!ve Case
30 / 600

poznavati
piti
Čekam Antu. I’m waiting for Ante.
Ne poznajem Krunu. I don’t know Kruno. ®
Now you know how to make accusative case of almost all nouns! We can
summarize the rules we have learned in a table:
noun type (N)
A (object)
nouns in -a
-a → -u
nouns in -o or -e
no change
nouns in a consonant
(not people or animals) no change
nouns in a consonant
(people or animals)
add -a
(These rules are not completely precise, but will work for almost all nouns; I will give
you the exact rules a bit later.)
Finally, let me explain how you can ask about objects. Start questions with the
following question words:
kog(a) who (as an object)
što what
For example, you can ask what Ana is watching, or who Goran is waiting for. There’s
a very important point: the answers must be again in the accusative case, as they are
still considered objects:
Što Ana gleda? What is Ana watching?
— Film. A movie. (A!)
— Konja. A horse. (A!)
Što Ivan pije? What is Ivan drinking?
— Kavu. Coffee. (A!)
Koga Goran čeka? Who is Goran waiting for?
— Anu. Ana. (A!)
Again, you’ll often hear and read the colloquial word šta ® instead of što. I’ll explain
details of who and what questions later, in 28 Asking Who and What.
You can, of course, answer with just:
— Ne znam. I don’t know.
The verb znati know is one of a very few verbs which shift their stress to ne¨ even in
the ‘western’ scheme, since its pres-3 has only one syllable (zna). I’ve indicated it
with an underline under ne¨. (People feel it’s pronounced differently than other ne¨
+ verb combinations, so you’ll see sometimes non-standard spellings as one word
i.e. neznam.)

In most of Serbia, Kruno has forms like Marko, so it would rather be ne poznajem
Kruna, but the name is really rare in Serbia.
The form šta is Standard in Serbia and most of Bosnia.
• Something Possibly Interesting
If you think this system is weird and complicated, you might be interested that
Russian has the same system. For instance, Russian words for brother and horse are
identical to Croatian ones, they are just spelled with Cyrillic letters as брат and конь
(Russian spells Croatian nj as n + special ‘softening’ character ь). In the accusative
case, they get the same ending, -а, since they belong to people and animals.
And then the Russian complications begin. You would expect A коньа, but Russian
spells the combination ь + а as a special character: я. So it’s rather коня, despite
that being really just adding an а, exactly like in Croatian...
It’s not all: the stress in the Russian word for horse shifts to the added -а, making the
first o unstressed and pronounced similar to а, despite the spelling. But the stress in
брат doesn’t shift: you have to learn by heart which nouns shift the stress... so
Croatian is not that bad after all.
Of course, this Russian stress shift corresponds to a change of tone in the Standard
Croatian word for horse (falling in N, rising in A), but we can ignore tones in
Croatian.
• Examples
Putujem I’m traveling, a pop song from Yammat – a Croatian band, despite its name
– uses a really simple grammar in most verses:
Svaka priča ima kraj
Every story has an end
Svaki kamen zavičaj
Every stone a homeland
More ili planina
A sea or a mountain
(Saša Ljiljak)
The words svaka and svaki are different forms of the adjective svaki every, each.
Adjectives are quite adaptive in Croatian; they will be introduced in 10 Gender.
The word zavičaj (which roughly translates as homeland, but the meaning is more

local) is in A, which is equal to N for it, according to the rules above. The following
verse has a negation:
Putujem i ne mislim
I’m travelling and I’m not thinking
  na tebe
  about you
The construction na tebe is the preposition na on + pronoun in A; we literally say
‘think on something-in-A’. Use of pronouns with prepositions will be introduced
later, in 34 Stressed Pronouns.

06 Destinations
With the knowledge of the accusative case and a few verbs, we can talk about
travel and express destinations. The useful verbs are:
dolaziti come, arrive
putovati (putuje) travel
ići (ide) go
odlaziti leave
There are couple of nouns that we can use with verbs to demonstrate use of
destinations:
Amerika America
bolnica hospital
hotel hotel
Hrvatska Croatia
grad city
kafić cafe bar
kino cinema ®
park park
Split (a city)
restoran restaurant
škola school
Zagreb (a city)
To express destinations, we have to put the preposition u¨ in front of the noun in
accusative, and then we can make sentences like these:
Ana odlazi u Ameriku. Ana is leaving for America.
Ivan putuje u Hrvatsku. Ivan is traveling to Croatia.
Idem u Zagreb. I’m going to Zagreb.
Goran ide u bolnicu. Goran is going to hospital.
We again see the two dots, introduced with ne¨; their meaning is the same (the
word is pronounced with the following word, stress moves to it in some words, for
some speakers.).
However, I won’t specially mark words and forms where stress moves to u¨, as it
would be too complicated; besides, this feature doesn’t completely overlap with the
standard stress area. You can just leave the stress on the noun, but be prepared to
hear the stress moved from some speakers (e.g. u + vodu = u vodu.)®
While English leave usually uses for instead of to, Croatian verbs use the same
prepositions.
The expression ide u školu can mean somebody is a school student, i.e. ‘goes to
school’:
Goran ide u školu. Goran goes to school.
However, if you go to an island or mountain, you must use the preposition na¨
instead of u¨. There are names of bigger Croatian islands:
Brač
Cres 
Hvar 
Korčula
Krk 
Lošinj
Pag
Rab
Vis
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 06 Des!na!ons
34 / 600

putovati
putovati
ići
putovati
ići
ići
For instance:
Ana putuje na Krk. Ana is traveling to the island of Krk.
Odlazim na Korčulu. I’m leaving for the island of Korčula.
Of course, this applies to the following nouns as well:
otok island ®
planina mountain
The preposition na¨ is used for all destinations that are perceived as surfaces, or
when the destination is on top – it’s usually translated as onto or on: you would use
it for roofs, tabletops, walls, etc.
Next, it would be great if we could say not just I’m... but also we’re! It’s quite
simple: Croatian again prefers not to use personal pronouns (I, we...) but a special
verb form, 1st person plural present (for short, pres-1pl). It’s a form quite simple to
make, just add an -o to the pres-1 form (one that ends in a -m):
idem I’m going → idemo we’re going
For instance:
Putujemo na Lošinj. We’re traveling to the island of Lošinj.
Odlazimo u Ameriku. We’re leaving for America.
The preposition na¨ also applies to the following popular destinations:
plaža beach
trg (city) square
For example:
Idemo na plažu. We’re going to the beach.
The preposition na¨ must be used with the cardinal points when used as directions:
sjever north
zapad west
istok east
jug south
For example:
Putujemo na jug. We’re traveling south.
The preposition na¨ is used with many metaphorical destinations (or rather,
activities):
na fakultet to university
na more to the seaside
na posao to work
na praznike to holidays
na put on a trip
na selo to countryside
(I’ve listed nouns in the phrases above in the accusative case; the form praznike is in
accusative plural, a form that will be explained later.) For instance:
Ana ide na posao. Ana is going to work.
Idemo na more. We’re going to the seaside.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 06 Des!na!ons
35 / 600

ići
ići
(Some of these destinations can be used also with u¨ – it makes their meaning
literal, e.g. u more means literally into the sea, to swim or dive, throwing something
into the sea, etc. Nouns that require the na¨ are marked in the Core Dictionary.)
The metaphorical na¨ includes all activities usually done in company, such as meals,
meetings and sport events:
na čaj to have a tea
na kavu to have a coffee ®
na koncert to a concert
na nogomet to football game ®
na odmor to vacation/break
na pivo to have a beer
na ples to dance
na ručak to lunch
na sastanak to a meeting
na večeru to supper
When you say na kavu, it requires motion to a destination (where you will have a
coffee or more than one), not just drinking coffee wherever you are. The
‘destination’ na nogomet means both playing football or just watching a game (this
applies to other sports and public performances as well).
The same holds for celebrations and parties:
na feštu to a local feast/party
na rođendan to a birthday party
na zabavu to a party
For instance:
Idem na kavu. I’m going to have a coffee.
Idemo na sastanak. We’re going to a meeting.
If it’s a bit confusing what ‘activities usually done in company’ are, they are simply
not literally places. Consider this:
not true places
true places
concert
concert hall
dinner
restaurant
football
playground
meeting
meeting room
movie premiere
cinema
You’ll later see that the preposition na¨ can be regarded as the default preposition in
Croatian.
Finally, the ‘destination’ na sunce usually doesn’t imply taking a spaceship, but
rather going to an open space, to get exposed to the sunlight:
na sunce in the sun
na zrak to (fresh) air ®
Pay attention: everything I’ve explained here are destinations, and not locations.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 06 Des!na!ons
36 / 600

ići
ići
putovati
If you say idemo na plažu, you aren’t describing where the action takes place,
but where you’re heading to (and you may get there or not). To help you
distinguish locations vs destinations, consider the following sentences:
I’m running to the gym.
(You aren’t in the gym,
just want to get there.)
= a destination
I’m running in the gym.
(You are in the gym,
and running there.)
= a location
If you feel that the word to is a better fit in English, it’s definitely a destination.
Confusingly, English uses on in e.g. going on vacation, when you’re actually not on
vacation yet – but Croatian treats this case as a destination too. While English
sometimes uses the same grammar for both, Croatian strongly distinguishes
destinations from locations.
So, what about locations? You will have to wait a while, since we have to learn
another noun form to express them. Destinations come cheap, if you know how
to make the accusative case.
The sentences above can be made more precise if we add one of the following
useful adverbs of time:
sad(a) now
danas today
sutra tomorrow ®
uskoro soon
prekosutra day after tomorrow
sljedeće godine next year
sljedeći mjesec next month
sljedeći tjedan next week ®
(As in English, you can talk about events in future and still use the present tense.)
Such words and expressions are often used to begin sentence with:
Sutra idem na sastanak. I’m going to a meeting tomorrow.
Danas idemo u kino. We’re going to cinema today.
Sljedeće godine putujemo na Hvar. We’re traveling to the island of Hvar
next year.
Finally, there are the following often used generic directions:
blizu close, near
daleko far away
dalje further, away
unutra inside
ovamo here
natrag / nazad back
van outside ®
tamo / onamo there
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 06 Des!na!ons
37 / 600

ići
ići
For example:
Ana uskoro dolazi ovamo. Ana is coming here soon.
To ask where to something or someone goes/travels, just start a question with:
kamo where... to
Nothing else except this word is needed, there’s no change of word order:
Kamo Ana ide? Where is Ana going to?
— Na posao. To work.
— Ide na posao. She’s going to work.
It’s normal to answer with just a destination, leaving the verb out; you can include
the verb if you want to emphasize it. In colloquial communication, especially in
some regions, you will hear e.g. gdje or kuda instead of kamo in such questions.®
As you can see, the accusative case is not used only for objects. In fact, almost all
cases in Croatian have more than one use. If you find somewhere on the Internet a
table where each case has one use, and even better, where each case “answers to
questions”, bear in mind that explains only a small part of the real use. I will
introduce other uses of accusative gradually.
________
® The following words or phrases are usually not used Serbia and most of Bosnia;
words or phrases pointed by arrows are used instead:
kava → kafa
kino → bioskop
nogomet → fudbal
otok → ostrvo
van → napolje
zrak → vazduh
sljedeći tjedan → sljedeće nedjelje / sljedeće sedmice
In Bosnia, in parts where Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) live, kahva is used for coffee
as well.
The word napolje is heard in parts of Croatia as well.
The stress moves to prepositions like u¨ and na¨ – only with specific nouns! – in
Bosnia, parts of Croatia (Dalmatia and Slavonia), and western parts of Serbia (not
including Belgrade) and western parts of Montenegro.
Instead of sutra, a slightly different form, sjutra, is used in Montenegro.
In Bosnia and Serbia, kuda is usually used to ask for destinations, kamo is not used.
Also, especially in speech, gdje (in Serbia gde) is frequently used in these countries.
• Something Possibly Interesting
Using prepositions with the accusative case to indicate where something is moving
to is not uncommon: German uses the same system.

You’ve maybe noticed that the ending -mo for the 1st person plural looks a lot like
what’s used in Spanish and Portuguese, and the same as in Italian. All these
languages descend from Latin, which had a lot of similarities with Croatian (and
other Slavic languages). For example, we’re eating is edimus in Latin.
It’s puzzling that some languages that are not considered related to Croatian have
similar forms: for example, in Finnish, we’re eating is syömme, where -mme is the
ending.

07 Verbs with Obligatory Objects
Verbs like čitati read have an optional object: you can either just read or read
something. What you actually do is the same in both cases: it’s just not specified
what you read in the first case (is it a book, newspaper, contract...)
However, there are many verbs where it’s not so, where you can either do
something to somebody (or something), or you can do it to yourself. For instance,
you can shave somebody else, or you can shave yourself. If you just ‘shave’,
Croatian treats would such sentences as ambiguous! Croatian requires an object
with such verbs.
This is an instance where something is implied in English – if you just shave, it’s
implied you do it to yourself – but not in Croatian. (There are few English verbs that
have a similar property, e.g. enjoy: you can either enjoy something or yourself – but
you have to express always what you enjoy.)
Some verbs like that are:
brijati (brije) shave
buditi waken
oblačiti put on (clothes)
prati (pere) wash
svlačiti take off (clothes)
vraćati return
With verbs brijati (brije) and prati (pere) you can shave someone or wash something
(or someone, e.g. a child):
Ana pere majicu. Ana is washing a shirt.
Ana pere lice. Ana is washing her face.
(Notice it’s just lice face: it’s always implied that a body part belongs to the subject.)
However, if you shave or wash yourself, you must use a special word – the ‘particle’
se. With these two verbs, it means ‘him/herself’:
Ana se pere. Ana is washing ‘herself’.
Brijem se. I’m shaving.
Instead of gender specific himself and herself, Croatian has only one word: se.
However, the word a bit special, as it cannot be freely moved around, it must be the
second word in a sentence, if possible! There are more words like that in Croatian. I
will mark them with a small 2 (²), to indicate their strange behavior (e.g. se²). This
mark is similar to another mark I’ve already introduced:
¨ — glued to the following word
² — fixed to a position in a sentence
Such second-position words are usually pronounced together with the word
preceding it – there’s no pause between Ana and se² in the example above — but
are always considered separate words and spelled as separate words.®
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 07 Verbs with Obligatory Objects
41 / 600

brijati
brijati
brijati
Sometimes two words are counted as ‘one unit’ and occupy the first position
together. One example is ne¨ + verb:
Ne brijem¹ se². I’m not shaving.
This applies to all words preceded by a word ‘glued’ to it (e.g. u¨, na¨) – they
together count as ‘one unit’. (Words marked with ¨ have a fancy name – proclitics,
and ones marked with ² are also called enclitics.)
This can also happen if you have two words that are frequently used together, e.g.
skoro nikad almost never – they together occupy the first position:
Skoro nikad¹ se² ne brijem. I almost never shave.
However, you will see sometimes that even such groups are split. Such ‘strict
placement’ occurs mainly in formal writing and formal speech (e.g. on the news
service of the public TV and radio):
Skoro¹ se² nikad ne brijem. (seen sometimes in writing)
Similar verbs are oblačiti and svlačiti. They correspond to two verbs in English. First,
you can either put on (or off) something:
Ana oblači majicu. Ana is putting a shirt on.
However, when these verbs get a person (or an animal, Croatian treats them more
or less always in the same manner) as their object, they get mean dressing (or
undressing) someone:
Ana oblači Gorana. Ana is dressing Goran.
Finally, if you want to express that Ana is dressing herself, you must use a se², as she
does it on her own, to herself, not to anyone else:
Ana se oblači. Ana is dressing.
The verb buditi is usually translated as wake (up), but it does not have a meaning be
awake, only stop sleeping. You can wake someone up, and in Croatian it sounds like
this:
Ana budi Gorana. Ana is waking Goran up.
But if wake up on your own, you must use a se²:
Ana se budi. Ana is waking up.
Finally, the verb vraćati means that you either return something, or you return
yourself, i.e. come back. You must use a se² for the second meaning:
Ana vraća knjigu. Ana returning a book.
Ana se vraća. Ana is coming back.
Next, there are some verbs that must be used with an object, but when used with a
se², their meaning shifts a bit. Often used ones are:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 07 Verbs with Obligatory Objects
42 / 600

zvati
zvati
zabavljati entertain
zvati (zove) call
When they are used with people as objects, they have the meanings I listed above:
Ana zabavlja Gorana. Ana is entertaining Goran.
Zovem Ivana. I’m calling Ivan.
But with a se², their meaning changes:
Ana se zabavlja. Ana is having fun.
Zovem se Goran. ‘I call myself Goran.’ = My name is Goran.
The second sentence, zvati (zove) + se² is the normal way to say in Croatian what
your name is. Please pay attention that the name is in nominative, no changes to it
are made. If you know some French, Italian or Spanish, such sentences should be
very familiar to you:
(French)
Il s’appelle Goran.
   
lit.
‘He calls himself Goran.’
(Italian)
Lui si chiama Goran.
(Spanish) Él se llama Goran.
On se zove Goran.
In all four languages, the verbs themselves mean call, but the meaning shifts when
they’re used with the so-called ‘reflexive’ pronoun (underlined in the examples
above). (Also, Spanish has the verb divertir that’s very similar to zabavljati.)
Unfortunately, English doesn’t use this pattern at all.
We can list these meanings in a nice table:
verb
used with
meaning
čitati
(A)
read
prati (pere)
A
wash
zabavljati
A
entertain
se²
have fun
zvati (zove) A
call
se² + N
... name is ...
The first verb has a non-mandatory object; the second one mandatory, and the last
two shift meaning.
Actually, if you consider again the verb return, there was also a small change in
meaning: it’s not the same to return something and to come back! There are more
such verbs where the meaning changes when they are used without an object.
Consider the following:
Goran opens the window.
The window opens.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 07 Verbs with Obligatory Objects
43 / 600

peći
While in the first sentence, Goran does something to the window, in the second
sentence, the meaning is completely shifted, as if the window is a subject that ‘does’
something. For all similar verbs (e.g. break, warm, close etc.) you have to use a se² in
the sentences of the second type:
Goran otvara prozor. Goran opens the window.
Prozor se otvara. The window opens.
Another common example:
Ana is cooking the soup.
The soup is cooking, the meat is roasting.
Again, in the second sentence, obviously the soup is not standing by the stove:
English verbs here are used in the alternative meaning. When these sentences are
translated to Croatian, the se² is mandatory:
Ana kuha juhu. ®
Juha se kuha, meso se peče.
(After a comma in Croatian, word-counting restarts: both se²’s are in the second
position.)
This use of se² is common when the action described in a sentence is not performed
by the subject (e.g. juha above) but by someone else, or just happens "on its own"
(e.g. somebody just left the soup to cook). (Also, this explains why se² is used when
someone wakes up on their own.)
This can be summed up as a simple rule: if in English meaning of a verb shifts
when used without an object, when you use the verb without an object in
Croatian, you have to use a se².
If you know any Spanish, everything so far most likely sounded very familiar to you.
There are three important differences, though: while in Spanish the ‘reflexive’
pronoun can be either me, te or se, in Croatian it’s always se².
The second difference is that se² must go to a fixed place in a sentence in Croatian.
The third difference is that in Spanish, the ‘reflexive’ pronoun is often spelled with
the verb when it appears after it (e.g. lavarse = ‘wash themselves’), the same holds
in Italian (e.g. lavarsi) and some other languages. However, the se² is always a
separate word in Croatian.
These are the basics of se². I’ll explain details a bit later, in 64 The Door Opens: Fun
with se².
Finally, there’s a rather strange verb that must use an object or a se²:
igrati play
You can use it with nouns (as objects, of course, put to accusative) meaning games
(or sports):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 07 Verbs with Obligatory Objects
44 / 600

košarka basketball
nogomet football (soccer)
šah chess
tenis tennis
For example:
Ana igra šah. Ana plays chess.
Ivan igra košarku. Ivan plays basketball.
However, if someone does not play some sport, or a game, but plays on their own
(e.g. with toys...) you must use a se²:
Goran se igra. Goran is playing.
The verb igrati is not used for "playing" musical instruments. For that, another verb is
used, svirati. This is the same difference as Spanish jugar vs. tocar.
There are more verbs that use the se². Some of them, like nadati hope have always
a se² with them, so they are usually listed as nadati se². Another such verb is smijati
(smije) se² laugh ®. You will discover more such verbs as you go.
________
® You’ll later see an example where Standard Serbian spells some second-position
words not as separate words.
Instead of juha, the word supa is used in Serbia, most parts of Bosnia, and in some
regions of Croatia as well.
In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, which completely dominates in Serbia, the verb
smijati (smije) se² has the unexpected form smejati (smeje) se²; there are more
verbs which behave like that; this alternation is not predictable – such verbs must be
learnt by heart, if you want to know both pronunciations.
• Something Possibly Interesting
In many grammars, verbs that have the particle se² are called reflexive. I’m not using
that term, since it’s not a property of the verb, it just has the ‘reflexive’ particle with
it. More precisely, the whole construction could be called ‘reflexive’. However, in
many languages, there are uses of such particle (or pronoun) that are not ‘reflexive’
at all. You can check examples in Wikipedia (Reflexive verb) and you’ll see how
Croatian examples nicely correspond to Spanish, French, Italian, German and
sometimes Danish ones. Unfortunately (for learners) English grammar is quite
different in this aspect.
Words behaving like se² – fixed to the second place in the sentence – are called
second position clitics. Besides Slavic languages, they appear in a number of Iranian,
Native American, Native Australian languages, and some others. Some older
languages also had them, including Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and Hittite.
Languages with second position clitics are typically quite flexible and have no articles

dizati
smijati se
(words like the), as observed by linguist Željko Bošković.
• Examples
Smijem se I laugh is a pop song by Jinx, a pop band from Zagreb (note a very non-
Croatian name). The song uses a lot of grammar we haven’t covered yet, but these
lines are simple:
I kada letim, kada sanjam
And when I fly, when I dream
Kad se dižem, kada padam
When I get up, when I fall
The verb dizati (diže) means lift, raise (something), but when you lift, raise yourself,
i.e. get up, you have to use a se², like in the last line. The word kad(a) when has an
optional vowel, and both versions are used in the verses above. We’ll learn more
about this word in the next chapter.
The chorus has some grammar which will be covered later, but it’s not too
complicated to understand:
Samo smijem se i smiješ se
I just laugh and you laugh
i sve je isto kao prije
and everything is the same as before
zamišljam [da ničega se
I imagine [I don’t
više ne sjećam]
remember anything anymore]
(Gordan Muratović)
We see again se², but in the first line we have actually two statements joined by i¨
and, so two second positions. In the third line, the da and everything after it is a kind
of sentence-within-a-sentence, so-called clause, and the word da holds the 1st
position in it; the word se² would normally come right after, but here the word
ničega is put to the 2nd position, likely for rhythmic reasons. I have put the clause
into square brackets. Clauses will be explained in later chapters.
The word ničega is nothing, but in a case we haven’t explained yet: while most verbs
use objects in A, some, like sjećati se² remember want objects in other cases – this
verb demands the so-called genitive case, which will be introduced later.
Note the više + negation: not anymore.

08 Weather and General Statements
Let’s take a look how you can express general statements in Croatian, such as it’s
cold in English. Such statements are often used for weather conditions.
In English, such sentences use ‘dummy’ it and the 3rd person present of the verb to
be (is), and that’s mostly shortened to it’s.
In Croatian, no pronouns can be used in such sentences, only the 3rd pers. present of
the Croatian version of the verb to be. It’s quite irregular:
biti (je² +) be
I have written a plus sign after je to indicate that other present tense forms cannot
be obtained by the usual rules – the forms of this verb must be learned, as in English.
(For example, the 1st person form isn’t "jem" but sam.)
There are useful words (called adverbs) that can be used with je² in such
expressions:
dosadno boring
hladno cold
kasno late
lijepo beautiful
mračno dark
oblačno cloudy
rano early
sunčano sunny
toplo warm
vedro clear
vruće hot
zabavno entertaining
There’s another important point: as you can probably see from the mark ², the word
je² behaves like se² and wants to be at the second place:
Hladno je. It’s cold.
Danas je hladno. It’s cold today.
Hladno je danas. (the same meaning)
Word order in Croatian is quite free – as you can see, words hladno and danas can
be exchanged – but it does not apply to some words like se² and je² that must go to
a predefined place in a sentence! (Therefore, I have introduced a special mark for
such words in 7 Verbs with Obligatory Objects.)
The adverb vedro is opposite of oblačno – it means the skies are clear.
There are a couple of useful words (adverbs of intensity) that can be placed before
adverbs above, and a prefix (not a separate word, but something that gets fused
with the word following it):
malo a bit 
jako very (not formal) ®
vrlo very (more formal)
prilično considerably
dosta quite
stvarno really
pre- too
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 08 Weather and General Statements
48 / 600

They must not be placed after the adverb, and are usually placed right before it. For
example:
Danas je jako hladno. It’s very cold today.
Jako je hladno danas. (the same, less common order)
Prevruće je. It’s too hot.
The adverb vrlo is a bit formal, it’s mostly used in formal writing, it’s less often heard
in spoken communication.
In the Standard stress scheme, when pre- is added to a word, the stress shifts to it;
in the ‘western’ scheme, it doesn’t: therefore prevruće. You will sometimes see the
prefix pre spelled as a separate word: that’s not standard.
There are two more adverbs of intensity often used in colloquial, spoken
communication:
strašno  
užasno
   terribly
For example:
Užasno je dosadno. It’s terribly boring.
What if you want to say it’s not cold? The rule is a bit different than for ordinary
verbs: you should add ni- to the front of je². The resulting word – nije – is not
restricted to the second position and is, in fact, usually placed before the adverb:
Nije hladno. It isn’t cold.
Uopće nije hladno. It isn’t cold at all.
Danas nije hladno. It isn’t cold today.
Nije hladno danas. (the same meaning)
There are useful words to express where your statement applies:
ovdje here
svugdje everywhere
tamo there
tu here
unutra inside
vani outside ®
In everyday, colloquial communication, ovdje and tu are used in the same meaning.
These words are often put to the front of sentences:
Ovdje je toplo. It’s warm here.
Vani je oblačno. It’s cloudy outside.
If you want to say it’s raining or it’s snowing, normally you should use the following
verb:
padati fall
And these nouns:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 08 Weather and General Statements
49 / 600

puhati
puhati
puhati
puhati
puhati
kiša rain
snijeg snow
Therefore, you actually say (in Croatian) the rain is falling or the snow is falling.
Words can go in any order, and it’s actually more common to put the verb at front:
Pada kiša. ‘Rain is falling.’ = It’s raining.
Kiša pada. (the same meaning)
Pada snijeg. ‘Snow is falling.’ = It’s snowing.
Snijeg pada. (the same meaning)
(Don’t forget ije in snijeg is pronounced by most people in Croatia as just je,
according to the normal pronunciation rules outlined before.)
There’s a similar expression about wind, using the noun vjetar (vjetr-) wind and the
following verb:
puhati (puše) blow ®
Again, words can go in any order, but the verb comes often at front:
Puše vjetar. The wind is blowing.
Vjetar puše. (the same meaning)
When it’s obvious what you’re talking about, you can use just a verb:
Pada. ‘It’s falling.’ (either rain or snow).
Puše. The wind is blowing.
You can use adverbs of intensity (except for vrlo) to express intensity of rain, snow
and wind:
Malo pada. ‘It’s falling a bit.’ (either rain or snow).
Jako puše. The wind is blowing strong.
The adverb jako with expressions for rain, wind and snow also corresponds to
English heavily. You can use the same adverbs (but not vrlo!) to express intensity of
any action where it makes sense:
Jako volim čokoladu. I ‘strongly’ love chocolate.
In Croatian, you can usually use the present tense to talk about future events (like in
English we’re leaving tomorrow). However, with weather expressions, you cannot
use the present tense in such a way (it’s hard to do it in English as well). However,
you can use adverbs of frequency to talk about things that happen anytime:
Često puše vjetar. The wind blows often.
If you want to ask about the weather, you should use:
Kakvo je vrijeme? What’s the weather like?
— Hladno. Cold.
It can be answered with just an adverb, as above. Such short comments are normal
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 08 Weather and General Statements
50 / 600

in casual, even in formal communication. It’s also possible to comment on any such
sentence:
Stvarno je vruće... It’s really hot...
— Nije jako. lit. ‘Not very.’ = It isn’t very hot.
In Croatian, short comments contain only the difference to what the comment is
on. For example, since it’s a comment on vruće, it’s not necessary to repeat that
word.
If you want to ask a more generic questions, that can be answered with ‘boring’, you
should ask just:
Kako je? How is it?
________
® In Bosnia and Serbia, the adverb mnogo is used in meaning very as well; for
instance, you can hear and read mnogo je hladno in these countries.
Instead of vani, napolju prevails in Bosnia and Serbia, and is also occasionally heard
in parts of Croatia. Besides puhati (puše), duvati is also used in Serbia.
• Something Possibly Interesting
You’ll maybe come across two Croatian verbs which work exactly like the English
verbs rain and snow: kišiti and sniježiti. However, these verbs are very rare in speech
and casual writing, including the Internet: pada kiša is some 20 times more common
than kiši, according to Google™.

09 Numbers and Time
Let’s introduce numbers in Croatian. They are actually a diverse group of words,
some of them behave like adjectives, others like nouns, most like adverbs. I will
show just the simplest use, how to express 59 or some time in a day.
The numbers 0-9 are:
0 nula 
1 jedan 
2 dva 
3 tri 
4 četiri 
5 pet 
6 šest 
7 sedam 
8 osam 
9 devet 
The number 0 is never pronounced like the letter o, unlike in English. Numbers 10-19
are:
10 deset 
11 jedanaest 
12 dvanaest 
13 trinaest 
14 četrnaest 
15 petnaest 
16 šesnaest 
17 sedamnaest
18 osamnaest
19 devetnaest
They are basically just 1-9 + -naest, with četiri shortened a bit. Most people
pronounce just an e in sequences -ae- in the words listed above.
Then, there are special words for 20, 30, etc, made in a similar pattern (but note the
stress marks):
20 dvadeset 
30 trideset 
40 četrdeset 
50 pedeset
60 šezdeset 
70 sedamdeset
80 osamdeset
90 devedeset
To express numbers like 35, use the following construction with i¨ and:
35 trideset i pet
It’s often shortened so these two numbers just get ‘glued together’:
35 tridesetpet
We can use those numbers to tell time. If you want to say that something happens
or will happen at some time, use just u¨ + number that specifies the hour:
Vlak dolazi u tri. The train comes at three o’clock. ®
You can, as in English, use the present tense for things that will happen in the near
future, especially if their time is known.
To specify where a train/bus/airplane is going to, use the preposition za¨ + A
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 09 Numbers and Time
52 / 600

(specifying the destination) just after the noun meaning train/bus/airplane:
Vlak za Rijeku odlazi u pet. The train to Rijeka leaves at five o’clock.
Autobus za Split odlazi u sedam. The bus to Split leaves at seven o’clock.
If you want to use more precise time, you can specify minutes:
Vlak dolazi u tri i dvadeset. The train arrives at 3:20.
Officially, Croatian uses 24-hour system, that is, 3 pm is 15:00. In schedules, and
radno vrijeme working hours, time is usually shown as 15:20 or 15.20, sometimes
with appended h. Sometimes, in handwriting, time is written as 1520, that is, with
minutes in superscript:
 
Colloquially, people would just use tri 3 even without telling is it in the morning or
afternoon.
To ask what the time is, use the following expression. It’s normal in Croatian to give
a quite short answer:
Koliko je sati? What’s the time? (lit. ‘How many hours is it?’)
— Tri i dvadeset. It’s 20 minutes past three.
— Šest. Six o’clock.
Such short, basic answers or short comments are very common in speech, and I will
explain them regularly. They are not impolite.
The word koliko is also frequently pronounced with stress on the first syllable
(koliko).
The word skoro can be used before any time (or more generally, any measure). For
example:
Koliko je sati? What’s the time?
— Skoro pet. Almost five.
(It’s interesting that Standard Croatian prefers another word, gotovo, instead of
skoro which completely prevails in speech and casual writing!)
It’s, of course, possible to ask when something will happen; to ask, just put the
following word to beginning of a sentence, nothing else is needed:
kad(a) when
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 09 Numbers and Time
53 / 600

For example (you should always include a preposition when you answer such
questions):
Kada dolazi vlak za Osijek? When does the train to Osijek arrive?
— U četiri i dvadeset. At 20 minutes past four.
There are two common adverbs you can use with time expressions:
tek not earlier than, only
već already
The adverbs relate to expectations: tek is having more time than one would expect,
while već is having less time than one would expect (i.e. already). For example:
Vlak dolazi već u dva. The train arrives at two o’clock already.
Vlak dolazi tek u osam. The train arrives not sooner than at eight o’clock.
These two words normally cannot be placed after the words standing for time (e.g.
u dva).
If you don’t know the precise time, you can use the preposition oko¨ instead of u¨:
Vlak dolazi oko dva. The train arrives around two o’clock.
A short answer to the previous question could be:
— Oko dva. Around two o’clock.
If you want to emphasize that some time is exact, add točno exactly ® before the
usual expression:
Vlak dolazi točno u tri. The train arrives at exactly 3 o’clock.
There are words for noon and midnight:
podne noon
ponoć midnight
Again, use u¨ + A to specify something happening at that time (for both words A =
N):
Autobusʷ¹ odlazi u podne. The bus leaves at noon.
You can simply say:
Ponoć je. It’s midnight.
Sad je podne. It’s noon.
Točno je podne. It’s exactly noon.
Of course, the word sad(a) is optional. The word točno cannot be right before the
time here, since they don’t make a closely connected expression, so the word je²
occupies the second position. You cannot use any personal pronouns in such
sentences; in fact, podne serves as the subject.
What if you want to tell it’s almost midnight, or already midnight? Again the word
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 09 Numbers and Time
54 / 600

je² will come between two words:
Skoro je ponoć. It’s almost midnight.
Već je ponoć. It’s already midnight. (not earlier)
Tek je podne. It’s only noon. (not later)
As you can see, već here really means you have less time available (you lost track of
time, and expected it’s only 11 or so). The same happens when it’s used with time
references in the future, e.g. već u dva at 2 o’clock already – you expected it leaves
later, you have less time available than you expected.
Of course, the same holds if you use pet 5 instead of ponoć, etc.
Colloquially, time is often expressed in halves:
Brod dolazi u tri i pol. The ship comes at half past three. (‘three and a half’)
(In colloquial speech, there are several quite different ways to express time by
halves and quarters, and there are different ways according to region; see 58
Colloquial and Formal).
Here are days of week in Croatian:
ponedjeljak (ponedjeljk-) Monday
utorak (utork-) Tuesday
srijeda Wednesday
četvrtak (četvrtk-) Thursday
petak (petk-) Friday
subota Saturday
nedjelja Sunday
The week always starts on Monday. Days of week are normal nouns in Croatian,
they are not always capitalized as in English. (As other nouns, they change according
to their role, by means of case endings!)
We can simply say:
Danas je srijeda. Today is Wednesday.
If you want to say that something happens or will happen on a weekday, use again
u¨ + A:
U srijedu se vraćamo u Zagreb. We’re going back to Zagreb on Wednesday.
Kada Ana odlazi u Split? When is Ana leaving for Split?
— U subotu. On Saturday.
This quite familiar word can also be used:
vikend weekend
If something is going to happen on/over the weekend, use za¨ + vikend:
Idemo na Brač za vikend. We’re going to the island of Brač over the weekend.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 09 Numbers and Time
55 / 600

Finally, if you’re curious how to say e.g. the train is leaving in 5 minutes, a small
disappointment: it requires some word forms (that, is cases) I haven’t introduced
yet. We still don’t know how to say three apples, actually – it will be explained in 30
Three Beers: Less than 5 Things – but I can give you a preview for minutes and hours:
Vlak odlazi za... The train is leaving in...
 jednu minutu 1 minute
 dvije minute 2 minutes
 tri minute 3 minutes
 pet minuta 5 minutes
 deset minuta 10 minutes
jedan sat 1 hour
dva sata 2 hours
tri sata 3 hours
pet sati 5 hours
pola sata half an hour
Please don’t draw too many generalizations from these examples, as you’ll see later
that the word sat hour behaves a bit specially. Relative references to future time will
be explained in 49 For 7 Hours: Definite Periods, but you have to cover the ground in
between first. And I’ll introduce an important feature dividing the words minute and
hour right in the next chapter.

10 Gender
In many languages, including Croatian, each noun is assigned a gender. This is a
slightly misleading term – it simply means what forms of other words you must use
whenever you refer to a noun.
For example, in English, when referring to a noun, you must use either he, she or it,
depending on the noun, but there’s no difference for most other words.
In German, you must use not only different pronouns, but also different articles (der,
die, das) and you have to adapt adjectives (kleiner, kleine, kleines) in some
situations.
In Spanish, you have to use different pronouns, different articles (el, la) and different
forms of adjectives (rojo, roja).
Since there are three different forms of pronouns in English, and three different
forms of articles in German, we can say that English and German have three genders
(in singular, there’s no difference in plural). There are two different forms of articles
and adjectives in Spanish, therefore Spanish has two genders.
There are four genders in Croatian, but the difference between two of them is very
small (and there’s no difference in plural). The gender in Croatian is similar to gender
in Spanish: it’s usually assigned according to the last letter of a noun. For instance,
kuća house is ‘feminine’ (since it ends in -a) in the same way as Spanish casa!
If you are familiar only with genders in English, this might be a bit surprising.
Consider genders simply the way nouns are grouped. Houses are not feminine in real
world. The gender that kuća house and sestra sister belong to is called ‘feminine’
simply because a lot of words for really feminine beings (e.g. for woman, sister,
daughter) happen to belong to it.
It’s straightforward to tell gender of a noun for almost all nouns in Croatian. The
rules are:
noun ends in
gender
some exceptions
-a
feminine (f)
e.g. riba fish
tata m Dad
Luka m (name)
-o or -e
neuter (n)
e.g. pivo beer
auto m car ® 
Marko m (name)
consonant
masculine (m)
e.g. stol table ®
kost f bone
noć f night
But there are four genders, right? Well, for masculine nouns there’s an additional
division. It will be important a bit later.
(In case you’re surprised that one gender is called neuter – that’s a fairly standard
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 10 Gender
57 / 600

f
m
name for a gender that’s neither male nor female.)
There are exceptions – e.g. names Luka and Marko look as if feminine and neuter;
in fact, both are masculine, and frequent male names. All personal names (for
people and animals) are either masculine or feminine (names ending in -o are
typically masculine).
Another exception – the noun tata – is actually masculine, it means Dad.
It’s actually only important to remember (and indicate) gender for exceptional
nouns, and there are only 50-100 such nouns used in everyday life. For example:
most bridge — masculine as expected, no need to indicate gender
kost f bone  — feminine, contrary to the common rules, so we must indicate its
gender (f)
The biggest group of nouns that have unexpected gender are feminine nouns not
ending in -a. Almost all of them end in a consonant. Common ones are:
bol f pain ®
bolest f disease
jesen f fall, autumn
kost f bone
krv f blood
ljubav f love
noć f night
obitelj f (close) family ®
ponoć f midnight
riječ f word
sol f salt ®
večer f evening ®
To help you with nouns that have unexpected gender, they will be underlined with
a bluish line, and their gender will be printed on the right margin. (If more that one
hint appears on the right margin, they will be separated with a vertical line.) For
example:
Vidim krv. I see blood.
Vozim auto. I’m driving a car.
Gender of words for people normally matches their natural sex (there are some
exceptions, though). Consequently, many terms represented by only one noun in
English have two nouns in Croatian: one for male and one for female (the same
holds in Romance languages like French, Italian or Spanish):
male
female
English
          friend
French
ami
amie
Spanish
amigo
amiga
Croatian
prijatelj
prijateljica
In Croatian, main words that must adapt to noun gender are adjectives – words that
indicate properties like big, red. In Croatian, adjectives also include words like my
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 10 Gender
58 / 600

jesti
and Ivan’s. They all must adapt to noun gender and case.
So, what forms of adjectives do we need to use in each gender? In simple sentences
like the house is big, nominative forms of adjectives are used, and they are very
simple:
gender
adj. N
example
feminine
-a
velika riba big fish
neuter
-o (some -e) veliko jezero big lake
masculine
optionally -i
velik(i) stol big table ®
You probably notice that there are two possible endings for the neuter gender. Most
adjectives use -o; adjectives that need -e will be shown a bit later. Here’s a list of
often used adjectives:
brz fast
čist clean
dubok deep
dug long
gotov ready, done
jak strong
jeftin cheap
lijep nice, beautiful
mali small, little
mlad young
nov new
poznat well-known
pun full
slab weak
skup expensive
spor slow
star old
širok wide
suh dry ®
velik big
visok high, tall
zdrav healthy, in good health
We can use them to assemble sentences like these:
Riba je velika. The fish is big.
Velika riba jede kruh. The big fish is eating bread.
Sunce nije jako. The sun isn’t strong.
Jezero je duboko. The lake is deep.
Ana je zdrava. Ana is healthy.
Restoran nije skup. The restaurant isn’t expensive.
Visoka je. She’s tall.
You can see that adjectives got an -o regardless of nouns having the final -o or -e:
it’s only gender that matters, and both jezero and sunce are neuter.
In Croatian (like in other Slavic and Romance languages) adjectives always adapt to
the noun, even if they are not right next to the noun. In German, adjectives in
sentences like The fish is big don’t adapt. That’s one detail where Croatian requires
words to change and German doesn’t. This makes pronouns mostly redundant, and
consequently not used, as in the last sentence, where ona she is implied by the form
of the adjective. Pay attention that in Croatian, kuća house and pizza are also she,
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 10 Gender
59 / 600

rasti
m
f
so it could be a statement about a house!
It’s possible to put the adjective first in sentences "X is Y", which emphasizes it:
Duboko je jezero. The lake is deep. (really deep)
One more detail is still not answered: adjectives have an optional -i in the masculine
gender. It’s not used when you use adjectives on their own, but it’s usually used
when an adjective is placed before a noun:
Hrast je star. The oak is old.
Stari hrast još raste. The old oak is still growing.
We have here used the verb rasti (raste) grow; the verb is not used to grow
something (i.e. cultivate).
Some adjectives (e.g. mali small, little) have always the -i in masculine, regardless
where they’re used, and they’re listed so. Its feminine form is mala and so on.
The adjective gotov is used to express that something is prepared or ready, e.g.:
Ručak je gotov. The dinner is ready.
The adverbs of intensity are also used with adjectives, and must be placed right
before them (or fused, in case of pre-):
Riba je jako velika. The fish is very big.
Jezero je dosta duboko. The lake is quite deep.
Restoran nije preskup. The restaurant isn’t too expensive.
Sunce je stvarno jako. The sun is really strong.
Vlak je strašno spor. The train is terribly slow. (colloq.)
The adverb of intensity jako is exactly the same as the neuter form of the adjective
jak strong, but its meaning is not equal. More about that in the next chapter.
Don’t forget: nouns and adjectives really don’t have the same endings. And you
should always keep in mind that there are couple of nouns having unexpected
genders (from their endings, at least):
Tata je zdrav. Dad is healthy.
Noć je duga. The night is long.
________
® In southern parts of Croatia (i.e. in Dalmatia) and parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
auto car is very often neuter in colloquial speech, so you’ll sometimes read and hear
novo auto.
The noun stol table has the form sto (stol-) in Serbia and most of Bosnia, but it’s still
masculine. Consequently, it’s velik(i) sto in Serbia.
The noun bol f pain is almost always masculine in Serbia, and is often understood as
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 10 Gender
60 / 600

masculine in Bosnia as well.
Instead of obitelj, words familija and porodica are common in most of Bosnia and
Serbia, and in some parts of Croatia.
The noun sol f salt has the form so (sol-) in Serbia and most of Bosnia; its gender and
case endings are the same.
The noun večer f evening has the form veče (večer- f) in Serbia and often in Bosnia,
with an additional twist: it’s considered neuter in the nominative case (since it ends
in -e), and feminine whenever any ending is attached to it (as indicated by an f after
its case-base)! It changes like other feminine nouns not ending in -a.
Instead of suh, suv is used in Serbia, and parts of Bosnia and Croatia (it’s non-
standard in Croatia).
• Something Possibly Interesting
Some people think everything in a language serves some purpose. There has to be
some benefit from gender, from case marked by endings, and so on.
However, I don’t think so. There was maybe a purpose once for many features, but
now we are just left with relics. For instance, why would the word noć night be
feminine? We know it’s inherited from very ancient times, since many related
languages have a similar word, and it’s usually feminine: German Nacht, Latin nox,
Greek νύξ nýx, Albanian natë, Lithuanian naktis etc. Therefore, the matching word
was almost certainly also feminine in the common ancestor of all these languages.
But we have no idea why it was feminine at all. Many things in languages are just so,
and we don’t know why.
In a case you will read a grammar published in Croatia, names of genders in Croatian
are muški rod (masc.), ženski rod (fem.) and srednji rod (neut.); for some unknown
reason, they are always listed in that order. Unfortunately, Croatian textbooks and
grammars written for general population always mention only three genders...
It’s interesting that some Croatian style/grammar manuals (i.e. books and websites
suggesting what is “correct”) suggest that bol, when meaning physical pain, must be
masculine. This advice is ignored by virtually everyone, including government
websites, textbooks, newspapers, scientific papers, etc. This is just in case you find
such an advice somewhere: just ignore it.
A small remark: Croatian nouns ending in -a, regardless of gender, are also called a-
nouns; feminine nouns not ending in -a are also called i-nouns.

• Examples
This list of side dishes from a small restaurant in Zagreb contains a number of
adjectives:
As you can see, all items are translated to English. Interesting ones are:
zelena salata literally means green salad – we don’t have a special noun for lettuce,
this phrase is used instead. Since salata is feminine (it ends in -a) the adjective zelen
green must go to the feminine form.
ljuta mljevena paprika – again, paprika is feminine by the usual rule, so both
adjectives before it get an -a. It’s interesting that the adjective ljut means both
angry and hot (spice). We don’t use words related to heat to describe how spicy
something is!
svježi kupus is literally fresh cabbage; the adjective is usually used to distinguish it
from the fermented cabbage, i.e. sauerkraut (kiseli kupus). The adjective svjež fresh
here got at -i before a masculine noun, which is, strictly speaking, not mandatory,
but extremely common.
kiseli krastavci is literally sour cucumbers, the noun is here in plural, which will be
described later (however, this noun simply gets an -i, as the adjective before it).
urnebes (ljuti/blagi) is likely a specialty of the restaurant. The noun means roughy
mayhem, pandemonium; the adjectives after it are still attached to the noun, so
both – the second one means mild – get that -i. Although adjectives normally
precede nouns, you will see them after nouns once a while, especially in menus.
ajvar is a condiment made of baked red peppers, common in Balkan cuisine. Also,
kajmak is not simply cream, but something specific for Turkish-influenced regions,
all the way to Central Asia and Mongolia (check the Wikipedia entry).

11 Colors, More Adjectives and Adverbs
Words for colors are adjectives as well. The main color adjectives in Croatian are:
bijel white
crn black
crven red
ljubičast violet
narančast orange ®
plavi blue
siv gray
smeđ brown ®
zelen green
žut yellow
For example:
Jabuka je crvena. The apple is red.
List je zelen. The leaf is green.
The adjective smeđ is one of adjectives that get an -e in neuter instead of the usual -
o:
Oko je smeđe. The eye is brown.
There’s a simple but effective rule to determine which adjectives get an -e: ones that
end in a Croatian-specific letter, that is, a letter that’s not pronounced like in English
or even does not exist in English. Beside smeđ, often used adjectives that get an -e
are:
loš bad
vruć hot
(You’ll encounter more such adjectives as you go.)
If you want to say that something is e.g. dark green, put tamno- to the front of the
color adjective – the result is one, long word. Likewise, light + color is expressed
with svjetlo-:
Majica je tamnocrvena. The shirt is dark red.
Auto je svjetlozelen. The car is light green.
Two color adjectives have a specific meaning with some nouns, quite different from
usage in English:
plava kosa blond hair
crno vino red wine
Literally, in Croatian, wines can be ‘black’, and blond-haired people have ‘blue’ hair.
(If you want to know why, the adjective plavi meant pale thousand years ago.)
There’s another adjective for "color" that’s frequently used in Croatian:
šaren multicolored, motley
It doesn’t really translate into English: it’s used when in English you would describe
something having colored stripes or many colors, especially bright, live colors:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 11 Colors, More Adjec!ves and Adverbs
64 / 600

Majica je šarena. The shirt is multicolored. (has bright colors)
There are two adjectives for colors that are used colloquially. Both have a special
behavior – they don’t change their form at all, neither in plural, nor in gender, nor in
cases. They have only one form. Such words are called indeclinable (indecl. for
short). They are:
lila pale violet  
roza pink ®
   colloquial &
  indeclinable
(The colloqual adjective for pink exists also as a normal adjective rozi.)
With colors and some similar adjectives, you can use the following adverbs that
stress completeness:
potpuno  
sasvim
 
  completely, fully
The adverb potpuno is much more common in speech. For example:
Soba je potpuno bijela. The room is completely white.
You can also combine colors: the first one is always in neuter N, and the second one
changes; they are usually spelled with a hyphen between:
crno-bijeli televizor black-and-white TV set
crno-bijela majica black-and-white T-shirt
crveno-plava zastava red-and-blue flag
Some adjectives have a slightly different form in the masculine nominative (which is
the dictionary form) and whenever anything is attached to them (e.g. when they get
an -a for the feminine gender).
For instance, the adjective dobar good has the feminine form dobra, that is dobr +
a. Other forms that have any ending are also formed as dobr + ending.
In the same way as for some nouns, can say that dobr- is the case-base of the
adjective dobar and list it together with the dictionary form. For most adjectives
their case-base is the same as their masculine form, so we list it only when it’s
needed. A good Croatian dictionary should list it too (or something equivalent to it,
e.g. the feminine form).
Often used adjectives that have a specific case-base are:
dobar (dobr-) good
gladan (gladn-) hungry
hladan (hladn-) cold
mokar (mokr-) wet
mračan (mračn-) dark
opasan (opasn-) dangerous
prazan (prazn-) empty
sladak (slatk-) sweet
sretan (sretn-) happy ®
strašan (strašn-) terrible
taman (tamn-) dark
tužan (tužn-) sad
umoran (umorn-) tired
važan (važn-) important
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 11 Colors, More Adjec!ves and Adverbs
65 / 600

ružan (ružn-) ugly
žedan (žedn-) thirsty
You see that two adjectives have meaning dark. The adjective mračan (mračn-)
means not well-lit, or gloomy (e.g. movie), while taman (tamn-) means something
painted in a dark paint, or having a dark color (e.g. hair).
The ‘case-base’ usually looks like nominative masculine form without the last a, but
sometimes there are other kinds of alternations:
bolestan (bolesn-) sick
topao (topl-) warm
Warning. Some books give a rough rule that -a- is always lost, whenever anything
is added. This is true for most adjectives with more than one syllable – but not
for all. Also, it’s not the complete rule, as you can see from additional consonant
changes that sometimes apply.
Let’s put the adjectives above to use:
Ivana je žedna. Ivana is thirsty.
Ivan je žedan. Ivan is thirsty.
As I have already explained, adjectives usually get an -i before masculine nouns,
especially colloquially; but it doesn’t happen with all adjectives, e.g. dobar (dobr-)
good is almost always used without -i:
On je dobar prijatelj. He’s a good friend.
Compare this with:
On je stari prijatelj. He’s an old friend.
Other adjectives with a specific case-base are often used without -i before
masculine nouns as well.
The following adjectives are used a bit differently than in English:
debeo (debel-) thick
lagan light(weight), ‘easy’
kratak (kratk-) short
mastan (masn-) fat
nizak (nisk-) low
težak (tešk-) heavy, ‘hard’
Croatian uses težak heavy and lagan light in the literal sense:
Kamen je težak. The stone is heavy.
Kutija je lagana. The box is light.
Croatian also uses these two adverbs to indicate difficulty, in a quite different
fashion than in English (the word dosta is here just to practice adverbs a bit):
Knjiga je dosta teška. The book is quite ‘heavy’. (= hard)
Problem je lagan. The problem is ‘light’. (= easy)
Next, the adjective nizak (nisk-) low is used to specify low height of things in
Croatian:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 11 Colors, More Adjec!ves and Adverbs
66 / 600

m
Polica je niska. The shelf is low.
Unlike English, it’s also used for short people (who are ‘low’ in Croatian):
Ana je niska. Ana is ‘low’. (= short)
The adjective kratak (kratk-) short is used in Croatian only to describe movies,
bridges, roads, pieces of wood, etc.
In a similar fashion, books and people can be debeo (debel-) thick:
Knjiga je debela. The book is thick.
Ivana je debela. Ivana is ‘thick’. (= fat, plump)
Furthermore, Croatian has two adjectives corresponding to English free:
besplatan (besplatn-) free (of charge)
slobodan (slobodn-) free (of restrictions), unoccupied
You would use the first adjective only when something is offered without payment,
e.g. a free sample, free show etc., and the other adjective in all other
circumstances. This is basically the same difference as German kostenlos vs. frei, or
Spanish gratuito vs. libre.
You will notice that neuter forms of adjectives are often used as adverbs, i.e. words
that modify verbs and other adjectives. For example, the adjective spor slow in the
neuter form sporo means slow (before a neuter noun, or when describing it) or
slowly when used without a noun:
Ana vozi sporo. Ana drives slowly.
Many adjectives are used like that, and it usually corresponds to English -ly, e.g.
užasno is the neuter form of terrible, but also stands for English terribly.
However, some adjectives when used as adverbs change meaning. They are best
remembered as separate words. The most often used ones are:
adjective
adverb
jak strong
jako very / very much
pun full
puno a lot ®
For instance, the first sentence contains an adjective, but the others contain adverbs
of intensity:
Vino je jako. The wine is strong. (about vino wine = a noun)
Jako je vruće. It’s very hot. (about vruće hot)
Auto je jako brz. The car is very fast. (about brz fast)
Goran jako voli čokoladu. Goran likes chocolate very much. (about the verb)
When used with another adverb or adjective, jako corresponds to English very (e.g.
very hot); with a verb, it corresponds to very much.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 11 Colors, More Adjec!ves and Adverbs
67 / 600

m
There’s one more useful, but very colloquial word, mostly used by younger people. It
can be used as an adjective and as an adverb of intensity with another adjective or a
verb. (Its use with verbs is very colloquial!) When used as an adjective, it’s
indeclinable:
super (colloq.)
  adj. indecl. great, excellent, superb
adv. super, very
For instance, you’ll hear and sometimes read:
Imam super majicu. (colloq.) I have a great shirt.
Auto je super brz. (colloq.) The car is super fast.
Ana super pjeva. (colloq.!) Ana sings great.
Finally, there’s one very useful word used for comparisons:
kao like, as
While English has two words used to compare against something else, Croatian has
one multipurpose word. It’s used like this:
More je hladno kao led. The sea is cold as ice.
The word kao doesn’t affect the case of the following word, and never changes case
etc. In speech, it’s often shortened to ko, spelled also as k’o.
________
® Instead of narančast, a slightly different adjective is used in Serbia: narandžast.
It’s also common in Bosnia. Besides smeđ, there’s another, but indeclinable
adjective for brown, used in Bosnia and Serbia: braon. It completely prevails in
Serbia, where smeđ is really only used to describe eyes, hair and color of pets.
Instead of roza, a slightly different word roze is common in Serbia and Bosnia. It’s
very uncommon in the regularized form rozi there.
Instead of sretan (sretn-), a slightly different word srećan (srećn-) is used in Serbia
and most of Bosnia.
Some style guides in Serbia discourage using puno as an adverb and advise mnogo is
used instead.

12 Simple Conversations
Let’s see how a simple conversation looks in Croatian. First, when you meet
someone, enter a shop, etc. you should greet people. The formal greetings are:
dobro jutro good morning
dobar dan good day/afternoon
dobra večer good evening ®
The noun večer f evening is a feminine noun ending in a consonant, so the feminine
form of adjective should be used. (You will also often hear a slightly corrupted form
dobar večer, and other worn out variants; in Dalmatia, you’ll often hear dobro
veče.)
The informal greetings vary. The most common ones are:
bok (Zagreb, Northwestern Croatia) ®
ćao (coast, other areas)
ej (Dalmatia, other areas)
haj
Warning. These words are not colloquial: they are informal, i.e. used among
friends and in the family. You cannot enter a random shop and address people
working there with bok. You can use informal words only with people you’re
close with.
The conversation would proceed depending on the level of familiarity. For example,
you can greet your grandmother with a formal dobar dan, but proceed in the
familiar mode.
Croatian has two second person forms of the verb and two pronouns: one for
(familiar) singular and another for plural. The forms are easily obtained from the
pres-3; the forms for the verb biti (je² +) are listed as well:
pres-2
pres-2pl
regular verbs
-š
-te
biti (je² +) be
si²
ste²
For example:
Čekaš vlak. You’re waiting for the train. (one person)
Čekate vlak. You’re waiting for the train. (a group, or with respect)
When you are talking formally to persons you don’t know very well, to your
superiors, etc., you should address them in plural, as if you were talking to a group.
You can then ask about how is someone doing. This is a real question, not just
formal as English how do you do:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 12 Simple Conversa!ons
71 / 600

zvati
Kako si? (fam.) Kako ste? (resp./group)
(Colloquially, you’ll often hear other questions with this meaning, e.g. šta ima, kako
ide, di si etc., depending on the region.) You can answer with e.g.:
Dobro, hvala. Fine, thank you.
Since the word hvala is very common in speech, it’s often simplified to fala.
It’s common to ask about family and close persons; the usual way is:
Kako je … (N) ? How is … doing?
This is quite simple, since you don’t have to do anything with the name of person
you are asking about – the nominative, default case is used. You can answer with a
short sentence, giving just the most important information, or a whole story:
Kako je Damir? How is Damir doing?
— Dobro je. He/she’s fine.
— Bolestan je. He’s sick.
— Ne znam. I don’t know.
To ask back (after you have answered) you have to use personal pronouns (I will
explain them fully in the next chapter):
Kako si ti? (fam.) Kako ste Vi? (resp./group)
Why do you have to use personal pronouns now? It’s mandatory when you switch
the subject, and someone else becomes the subject. It’s also common to start such
back questions with A kako… (actually, the word a emphasizes the change of topic).
English has only one pronoun for both meanings – you – and verb forms are always
the same. However, English once had such a difference, but it was lost. Southern US
varieties have now colloquially you (singular) vs. y’all (plural). It’s important to
remember that Croatian vi is used also to address single people you respect or
you’re not familiar with, while ti is used only for individuals you’re close with.
You can use the word kako to ask about someone’s name. The sentence uses the
same grammar as French, Italian or Spanish, and it’s actually simpler – se² is always
used:
(French)
Comment t’appelles-tu?
   
lit.
‘How do you call yourself?’
(Italian)
Come ti chiami?
(Spanish) ¿Cómo te llamas?
Kako se zoveš?
All sentences above are informal, of course: you would use them with e.g. children.
For adults you’re not familiar with – and you wouldn’t ask for their name if you were
familiar with them – you need plural: kako se zovete.
You can comment how somebody looks. The most common way is to use the verb:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 12 Simple Conversa!ons
72 / 600

izgledati (izgleda) appear, seem, look
This verb has – only in the Standard scheme – a different syllable stressed in the
present compared to the infinitive: one syllable to the left. Actually, such shift in the
present tense happens to many verbs, about 13% of verbs listed in the Core
Dictionary.
Since it would be too much to list all pres-3 forms that differ from infinitives just by
a stress mark, I’ve invented the following shorthand notation: instead of writing a
completely regular pres-3 form with just a shifted Standard stress, I’ll simply write
the symbol «:
Shorthand for Standard stress shift
instead of
izgledati (izgleda)
I’ll write just
izgledati («)
That symbol means: in the Standard scheme, the stress moves one syllable left in the
present tense forms, compared to infinitive. In the ‘western’ scheme, the stress does
not move (I personally pronounce it on the same syllable in both inf and pres-3).
Therefore, I’ll list such verbs simply as:
izgledati («) appear, seem, look
The verb izgledati («) is used with adverbs or adjectives in neuter singular (they are
quite similar in Croatian anyway). For example:
Izgledaš odlično. You look great. (fam.)
More adverbs that are commonly used with this verb are super (colloq.) great,
lijepo nice and umorno tired.
If you are asking someone to give you something, you should use the verb moliti
kindly ask (which covers English meaning please):
Molim te… (fam.) Molim Vas… (resp./group)
After that, a word in accusative should be used, e.g.:
čašu vode a glass of water
jedan čaj a cup of tea
jednu kavu a cup of coffee
jedan sendvič a sandwich
kartu za vlak a train ticket
kartu za Zadar a ticket to Zadar
(I listed words and phrases in A, for convenience; some of them use grammar
features that will be explained a bit later. Also, forms te and Vas above are
accusatives of ti and Vi; they will be explained in the next chapter.)
When you are introduced to someone, you can say:
Drago mi je. I’m glad (to meet you).
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 12 Simple Conversa!ons
73 / 600

When you are in company, and the others are about to start eating, you can say:
Dobar tek. (like French bon appétit) ®
If you are giving a thing to someone (a gift, whatever) you should use one of the
following words:
Izvoli. (fam.) Izvolite. (resp./group)
The word izvolite also means how can I help you. For instance, if you come to a
bank, a clerk will use the word to ask you what he or she can do for you. The same
word will be used by a waiter in a bar, restaurant, etc.
If you are given something, you should respond with:
Hvala. Thank you.
It’s often strengthened and made even more polite with lijepo (sometimes lijepa) or
a bit more colloquially, puno:
Hvala lijepo. Thank you. (politely)
If you want to say that someone is welcome, use the following expressions (they
depend on the gender of the person you’re talking to, unless you’re talking formally
or to a group:
Dobro došao. (to a male you’re familiar with)
Dobro došla. (to a female you’re familiar with)
Dobro došli. (to someone you aren’t familiar with, or to a group)
(The words došao, etc. are adjective-like forms of the verb, which are otherwise
used to form the past tense; it will be explained a bit later.)
If you want to express where someone is welcome to, use destinations, i.e. u¨ / na¨
+ A (English uses to, i.e. destinations as well):
Dobro došli u Hrvatsku! Welcome to Croatia! (to a group / not fam.)
You will often see the two words are spelled together, e.g. dobrodošao and like.
When leaving, you can use the following farewells:
do viđenja goodbye
laku noć good night
The farewell do viđenja – often spelled as doviđenja – is quite formal. The
following expressions are a bit less formal:
vidimo se see you
čujemo se (the same, but over the phone)
pozdrav bye
The following words are quite informal:
bok (Zagreb, Northwest Croatia)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 12 Simple Conversa!ons
74 / 600

ćao (coast, other areas)
adio (Dalmatia, other areas)
(These geographical differences are not absolute, you will hear ćao occasionally
from people in Zagreb, bok in Dalmatia, etc.)
If someone is not just leaving, but departing, that is, he or she will travel, you should
always use:
sretan put nice journey (French bon voyage)
________
® Instead of dobra večer, dobro veče is common in most parts of Bosnia and Serbia,
and heard in Croatia as well; zdravo is a common greeting in these countries, and
sometimes it’s heard in Croatia as well. The greeting ćao is very common in Serbia.
Instead of dobar tek, in Serbia and Bosnia usually prijatno is used, also heard in
some parts of Croatia.

13 She Loves Me: Pronouns and Properties
Let me introduce more pronouns and continue with uses of adjectives and of the
verb biti (je² +) be.
We have learned some personal pronouns (ti, vi, on...) but not all. Also, we’ve seen
only their subject forms, i.e. the nominative case. What if we want to use pronouns
as objects? What if we want to say I am? How to say I love you? How to say she
loves me?
As in English, the forms of pronouns are not regular and have to be learned.
Fortunately, they are not too complicated (and two of them are similar to English
pronouns). Here are the forms for the first two persons (I, you, we):
singular
plural
pers.
N
A
   
N
A
1st
ja
me²
mi
nas²
2nd
ti
te²
vi
vas²
To help you learn various forms of pronouns, they will be underlined with a pale
blue line, and information about them will be printed on the right margin (e.g. 2 =
2nd person, 2pl = 2nd person plural, 3f = 3rd person, feminine gender).
Like the word se², personal pronouns in accusative must be put to the second
position in a sentence (check 7 Verbs with Obligatory Objects.) For example:
Ana¹ me² čeka. Ana is waiting for me.
As usual, the second position should not be understood mechanically. Two or more
words, if they form a phrase, can occupy the first position. It’s normal to say:
Moj prijatelj¹ te² čeka. My friend is waiting for you.
(I’ll explain the possessive adjective moj my in the next chapter. It’s a bit special, e.g.
it never gets an -i in masc.)
Again, you’ll find sometimes in books and newspapers that the second position is
forced, even splitting combinations adjective + noun. That’s never used in speech
(except maybe in very formal speeches, e.g. in the news on the public radio, or in
some rural areas):
Moj¹ te² prijatelj čeka. (the same meaning, very formal, in writing)
Then, of course, there’s the famous example:
Volim te. I love you. (to someone you’re familiar with)
As I’ve already explained, Croatian vi/vas stands both for plural (y’all, you guys) and
respect (you sir/madam). The second use is usually distinguished by using a capital V
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 13 She Loves Me: Pronouns and Proper!es
76 / 600

2pl
2pl
3m/n
3m/n | poznavati
3f
3f
in writing:
Ana vas čeka. Ana is waiting for you (guys).
Ana Vas čeka. Ana is waiting for you (sir/madam).
(There are also longer, ‘stressed’ forms of personal pronouns, but they are used only
in specific circumstances, and will be introduced later.)
And here are the forms in the 3rd person singular (he, she, it):
3rd person
N
A
fem.
ona
je² / ju²
neut.
ono
ga²
masc.
on
As you can see, the 3rd person accusative pronouns have one form for all genders
except the feminine. You’ll see that pronouns have much fewer forms than you have
maybe expected. For example:
Volim ga. I love him/it. (depending on the context)
Ona ga ne poznaje. She doesn’t know him/it. (depending on the
context)
The accusative case of ona she has two forms which are used interchangeably ®.
For example, if you’re talking about a knjiga book – a feminine noun – both are
acceptable and used:
Čitam je. I’m reading it. (lit. ‘reading her’)
Čitam ju. (the same meaning)
(Since the form of pronoun je² coincides with the pres-3 of biti (je² +) be, it’s
avoided when the verbal je² appears in the same sentence; we’ll see such sentences
a bit later).
Pay attention: the noun knjiga book is feminine. The same goes for voda water
and kuća house. And the same goes for noć night and obitelj family. You have to
use feminine pronouns (ona, ju², je²) when referring to them, as you would use
for your sister.
Likewise, nož knife and auto (aut-) car are masculine nouns. You have to use
same pronouns to talk about a knife, a car and your brother.
Pronouns are often used to describe what something is. Both what’s described and
the description should be in the default, dictionary form – the nominative case. For
example:
Ivan je student. Ivan is a (university) student.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 13 She Loves Me: Pronouns and Proper!es
77 / 600

On je student. He’s a (university) student.
English has only one word – student – for both male and female students. For most
such roles, Croatian has two words, one for male, another for female.
There’s no straight rule how male and female words relate, but most often, the
word for female is made by adding -ica to the word for male (the suffix -ica has
other uses as well):
male
female
singer
pjevač
pjevačica
professor
profesor
profesorica ®
(univ.) student
student
studentica ®
teacher
učitelj
učiteljica
For example, if a female person is a student, you would say:
Vesna je studentica. Vesna is a (university) student.
Croatian has two words that correspond to English man:
čovjek man/human
muškarac (muškarc-) man (focus on masculinity)
You would use čovjek in all normal circumstances (you can and should use it in
generic sense, for someone you don’t know sex of), and the other word is used only
when it’s important that someone is male, e.g. when talking about how he looks:
Ivan je marljiv čovjek. Ivan is a hard-working man.
On je zgodan muškarac. He’s a handsome man.
For most animals (humans included) the default gender is masculine: you can use
masculine nouns when you have a mixed group, if you simply don’t know someone’s
sex or you want to speak about people or some animals in general. The masc.
gender is so generic that it can be sometimes used for women too:
Ana je dobar čovjek. lit. ‘Ana is a good man/human.’
Ona je novi profesor. She’s the new professor.
It’s all nice, but how to say I’m a student (male or female)? For that, we need
another personal pronoun introduced above (the N form, of course), and the right
verb form:
biti (je² +) be → pres-1 sam²
For example:
Ja sam student. I’m a student. (male)
Ja sam studentica. I’m a student. (female)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 13 She Loves Me: Pronouns and Proper!es
78 / 600

Croatian does not use personal pronouns as subjects often, but in such sentences,
they are used.
However, when you are describing a condition at the moment, something that can
change in any minute, using adjectives, pronouns are usually omitted. Instead of ja
sam..., this is the most often used form:
Gladan sam. I’m hungry. (male)
Gladna sam. I’m hungry. (female)
Pay attention: although ja and ti don’t distinguish gender, you still have to adjust
the adjective to the gender ‘hidden’ behind them. This is similar to Romance
languages like Italian and Spanish:
(Sp.) Estoy cansado. I am tired. (male)
(Sp.) Estoy cansada. I am tired. (female)
If you know some Spanish, it could interest you that the use or dropping of personal
pronouns in Croatian sentences like I am... basically matches Spanish verbs ser vs.
estar (but there are some exceptions):
Spanish
Croatian
Soy estudiante.
Ja sam student.
Estoy cansado.
Gladan sam.
If you would add an adverb (i.e. opet again, možda maybe, jako very etc.), it never
behaves as attached to the adjective, so second position words easily come in
between.
Goran je jako gladan. Goran is very hungry.
Jako sam gladan. I’m very hungry. (male)
(Normally the adverb comes left from the adjective, but it can be tweaked too to
emphasize the adverb.)
What about saying you’re not hungry? The same principle works as for other forms
of present of the verb biti – just add ni- ®; the resulting form is not restricted to the
second position and in fact, usually comes before the adjective (but adverbs
modifying the adjective usually come in between):
Nisam gladan. I’m not hungry. (male)
Uopće nisam gladna. I’m not hungry at all. (female)
Nisam jako gladna. I’m not very hungry. (female)
The second person pronoun is ti in singular and vi in plural (also used for polite
addressing). The corresponding forms of verb biti we have already learned.
Nisi gladan. You are not hungry. (male)
Gladna si. You’re hungry. (female)

In nominative plural, adjectives get ending -i in the masculine gender, for mixed-sex
groups, but also in all polite sentences, regardless of the real gender of person
you’re addressing:
Gladni ste. (all-male group)
Gladni ste. (mixed group)
Gladni ste. (politely to one person, male or female)
All sentences above, of course, translate to English as just you’re hungry. Feminine
plural adjectives get -e in nominative; it’s used only for groups where all members
have feminine gender:
Gladne ste. (all-female group)
The same rule works for 1st person plural (we are) where the personal pronoun is mi
and the verb to be has the following form:
biti (je² +) be → pres-1pl smo²
(This is an exception to the rule that pres-1pl is simply pres-1 + o.)
For instance:
Umorni smo. We’re tired. (all-male group)
Umorni smo. (mixed group)
Umorne smo. (all-female group)
________
® In Serbia and usually in Bosnia, the accusative form ju² is used only if there’s the
pres-3 form je² in the same sentence.
In Serbia, instead of profesorica and studentica, profesorka and studentkinja
prevail, but učiteljica is used everywhere.
In Montenegro, negative present tense forms of the verb biti (je² +) be have always
nije-, i.e. nijesam, nijesi etc., but the 3rd pers. is just nije.
• Something Possibly Interesting
It’s not a coincidence that Croatian words ja and me are similar to their English
counterparts I and me: English and Croatian are distant cousins. Even more similar
are Latin 1st and 2nd pronouns in A – they’re almost identical to Croatian ones:
pers.
A (sg.) A (pl.)
1st
mē
nōs
2nd
tē
vōs
(This can help you remember Croatian pronouns if you already know Latin, and help
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 13 She Loves Me: Pronouns and Proper!es
80 / 600

you learn Latin pronouns if you know Croatian and decide to learn Latin one day.)
But it’s surprising how many languages in Europe and Asia have first pers. pronouns
starting with m- and 2nd person with t-. You can find more in this map in the World
Atlas of Language Structures: M-T Pronouns.
The particle se² comes historically from a pronoun in A.
Second-position pronouns are pronounced with the word before them, but spelled
as separate words. It means čeka te he/she’s waiting for you is pronounced exactly
the same as čekate you (guys) are waiting. Therefore, some people will mix them up
in spelling, usually spelling verb endings as separate words, since they are taught that
spelling separate words together is a mistake. Be prepared.

14 My and Adjectives in Accusative
We now know how to say:
Jedem jabuku. I’m eating an apple.
Jabuka je crvena. The apple is red.
But we still don’t know how to say I’m eating a red apple! If you want to put an
adjective before a noun in accusative, you have to put the adjective into the
accusative as well. To put an adjective into the accusative case, you have to take
into the account the gender of the noun beside it. Jabuka is feminine, so what’s the
feminine accusative ending for adjectives? Not really complicated, it’s -u, so we
have:
Jedem crvenu jabuku. I’m eating a red apple.
In this example, the adjective gets the same ending as the noun, but consider it a
coincidence. If you would take a weird feminine noun that ends in a consonant (e.g.
krv f blood) the adjective would still get the -u:
Imam crvenu krv. I have red blood.
This is what gender means: what adjective or pronoun forms you have to use.
Nouns have fixed gender – jabuka is ‘feminine’ because its default, nominative form
ends in -a, and krv blood just simply is – but adjectives adapt to the ‘class’ the noun
belongs to, and that ‘class’ is called ‘gender’ by tradition.
And now we’re going to see the four genders in Croatian. The masculine gender is
really two genders: one for masculine people-and-animals, another for everything
else masculine. Adjectives for masculine people-and-animals will get -og:
Imam crnog psa. I have a black dog.
These are all accusative adjective endings you need to remember. For neuter nouns,
and masculine other than people-and-animals, adjectives are the same as in the
nominative – of course, the N form depends on the gender. This table summarizes
the scheme (I’m here using p/a for ‘people and animals’):
gender
adj. A

fem.
-u
veliku ribu

Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 14 My and Adjec!ves in Accusa!ve
82 / 600

m
Usually, the two masculine genders are called masc. animate (the gender for
masculine people and animals) and masc. inanimate (the gender for everything else
‘masculine’).
You might ask: why is the gender of nouns like zid wall called ‘masculine’ at all, when
it has no people or animals in it? How is a wall masculine? Name of that gender is
simply a tradition; also, looking at the endings in the nominative case, adjectives
referring to these nouns get the same endings as for the nouns konj horse and brat
brother. The pronoun referring to a table will be on, usually translated as he.
If your brain still short circuits because of the term masculine inanimate, shorten it
to just ‘inanimate’.
Strictly speaking, the gender of masculine people and animals includes also beings
that are neither, e.g. gods, angels, ghosts, all creatures from Lord of the Rings,
snowmen – and robots! It’s important that something is perceived as having its own
will (or mind), even if it’s a microscopic worm. Such ‘genders’ are not at all
uncommon among world languages.
Something interesting: only in accusative (singular) adjectives have different endings
for all 4 genders. In most cases – I will introduce them later – there’s one adjective
ending for the feminine gender, and another for everything else. This makes
everything much simpler than it could be.
Examples for all 4 genders:
Imam crnu mačku. I have a black cat.
Vozim crni auto. I’m driving a black car.
Vidim crnog konja. I see a black horse.
Vidim žuto sunce. I see the yellow sun.
(The noun auto, despite ending in -o, is a masculine inanimate noun, one of
exceptions I have already listed when I introduced genders.)
Since in the masculine inanimate gender adjectives have the same form in N and A,
the -i is optional in A as well – but it’s almost always used when adjectives are
placed before nouns, as here. (Standard Croatian insists on a small difference in
meaning between adjectives with -i and without; it will be described later.)
There’s an alternative ending in masculine-people-and-animals (-eg). It’s attached to
adjectives that get an -e in the neuter nominative (and accusative) – i.e. to
adjectives that end in a Croatian-specific letter:
Vidim smeđeg konja. I see a brown horse.
You will sometimes see (in books and newspapers) adjectives having the ending -oga
or -ega instead of -og or -eg. There’s no difference in meaning: it’s just an older
form that’s sometimes still preferred in writing.®
As promised, here are the exact rules for the accusative case of nouns (instead of
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 14 My and Adjec!ves in Accusa!ve
83 / 600

p
(
‘same as nominative’, or ‘no change’, I wrote just ‘= N’):
noun type (N)
A
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -u
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) = N
masculine
not in -a
(not p/a)
= N
(p/a)
add -a
fem. not in -a (e.g. noć)
= N
(They differ from the previous, approximate rules only for a few nouns, e.g. kokoš f
hen and zvijer f beast – the approximate rules didn’t take the gender into account.)
I’ve included the approximate rules (≈) for gender in the table, e.g. nouns that end in
-a in N are usually feminine, etc. The important criteria have nothing to do with the
approximate rules: all nouns than end in -a change it in A to -u. As some masc.
nouns end in -a, I’ve stressed that the masc. endings apply only to nouns not ending
in -a.
I will introduce here a very useful adjective, moj my. This is simply an adjective in
Croatian, but it’s not so in English. For example, you can say:
the red apple; the apple is red
If you try to replace the word red in the sentences above with my, you’ll see the
problem. Not so in Croatian, where you simply say:
moja jabuka
Jabuka je moja.
While moj is used as any other adjective, it still has two peculiarities:
First, unlike other adjectives, it never has the optional -i in masc. N.
Second, in masculine (also in neuter gender, we’ll see later) it has special, shorter
forms. There’s absolutely no difference in meaning, use, you can use longer or
shorter forms wherever you like, but shorter forms are much more frequently used:
gender
N
A
fem.
moja
moju
neut.
moje
= N
masc.
(not p/a) moj
= N
masc.
(p/a)
mog
mojeg
There’s nothing special about forms for the feminine gender, they are in the table
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 14 My and Adjec!ves in Accusa!ve
84 / 600

poznavati
above just for completeness sake. (There’s nothing special about neuter forms
either, since j is Croatian-specific.)
In fact, you’ll see that some adjectives and adjective-like words in Croatian tend
to have specific forms, but never in the feminine gender: all specific forms of any
adjective are limited to masculine and neuter genders.
For example:
Ana vozi mog brata na posao. Ana is driving my brother to work.
Ana vozi mojeg brata na posao. (the same meaning, but rarely used)
(As with other adjectives, you will sometimes find the form in A mojega, and the
shorter form moga – there’s no difference in meaning, such forms are just a bit
archaic.)
In the previous chapter, I’ve explained how there are two words for man in
Croatian. It’s interesting there’s only one word for both woman and wife:
žena woman, wife
If you use that word with a possessive adjective like moj (or any of the possessive
adjectives we’ll learn later) it’s understood as wife:
Vidim ženu. I (can) see a woman.
Poznaješ moju ženu. You know my wife.
There is a word meaning precisely wife in Croatian, but it’s very formal and used
only in official records, in very formal speech and so on.
If this all sounds overwhelming to you, here are nouns and adjectives in a nutshell –
just learn this like a poem:
gender
example
N
A
fem.
big fish
velika riba
veliku ribu
neut.
big lake
veliko jezero
no change
big sea
veliko more
m. inan.
big wall
velik(i) zid
no change
m. anim.
big brother
velik(i) brat
velikog brata
There’s an interesting rule:
If the majority of nouns (in a gender) have the same form in two or more cases,
adjectives (in the same gender) have identical forms as well. If they have different
forms, adjectives have different forms as well.
For instance, neuter nouns have the same form in N and A. Therefore, the adjectives
in neuter gender have the same form in N and A (you can check the table above).
Masculine nouns representing people and animals have different forms (they get an
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 14 My and Adjec!ves in Accusa!ve
85 / 600

-a in A), so adjectives in masculine gender for people and animals have different
forms in N and A (they get -og in A).
You’ll later see that nouns ending in -a – by and large feminine – have the same form
in nominative plural and accusative plural. Therefore, you can immediately conclude
that adjectives in the feminine gender have the same form in nominative plural and
accusative plural.
Adjectives follow the pattern (but not the endings) of the majority of nouns in a
given gender. For instance, feminine nouns in a consonant (e.g. noć f night, sol f salt)
have some cases identical (e.g. N and A singular), but it has absolutely no effect on
the pattern of adjectives, since such nouns are really a minority.
(You’ll often see that in textbooks only three genders are mentioned and the
difference in the accusative case is not called gender. The division to four genders is
the simplest explanation, in my opinion at least.)
Finally, you’ll see sometimes, in writing, that certain adjectives in A have endings like
nouns, e.g. vidim crna konja. This is never used in everyday life and casual writing.
Such indefinite adjectives will be briefly described in 99 Aorist Tense and Other
Marginal Features. You can safely ignore them for now.
________
® Such longer endings are extremely rare in Serbia and Bosnia.
• Something Possibly Interesting
The word rak means both crab and cancer, but when it refers to an animal, it’s
treated as masculine animate, and when it refers to the disease, it’s masculine
inanimate.
However, the name of a football club from Split, Hajduk, is usually treated as
masculine animate, even when referring to the club: it means highwayman, outlaw.
Very few Croatian grammars treat gender in Croatian in a consistent way, by having
4 genders. It’s much more common in Czech grammars (Czech is a close cousin to
Croatian, with essentially the same system). However, Russian (which has essentially
the same system as well) is always described with three genders. There are even
people who claim that there have to be three genders, since it’s ‘natural’, and ‘this is
what we were taught in schools’.
If we want to be precise, we can say there are basically 6 types of nouns in Croatian,
based on how they change (i.e. what endings they get) and what forms of adjectives
and pronouns they require:

Forms of adjectives are called ‘genders’ by tradition (the problem is, many people
usually consider only forms in N, so they see only 3 genders), and patterns of noun
endings are called ‘declension classes’. While everyone heard about gender, very
few people are aware of declension classes. They are much less clear-cut than
genders: for instance, nouns like konj horse and sin son seem to belong to the same
class, but we’ll see they form plural a bit differently. Should we split them to two
classes? It depends on your viewpoint.
(I’ve invented the names of patterns in the table above, I’m quite sure nobody ever
used Greek letters for these patterns. You’ll find various names in various books:
they are ultimately unimportant. However, i-nouns and a-nouns are worth
remembering.)
• Examples
Crno-bijeli svijet Black-and-White World is one of the most popular songs by Prljavo
kazalište Dirty Theater, a rock band from Zagreb. The song opens with the famous
line:
Moje ime je Davorin Bogović
My name is Davorin Bogović
a ovo sve oko mene
and all this around me
to je crno-bijeli svijet...
it’s a black-and-white world...
Crno-bijeli televizori

moja bijela djevojka
my white girlfriend
uvozni ekskluzivni program

Mom, Dad, a dog and a tie...
(Jasenko Houra)
See how mojN my and other adjectives adapt to the gender of nouns after them. All
the forms are in N, just different genders.
The second line has ovo sve, lit. these all; such forms will be explained later. It also
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 14 My and Adjec!ves in Accusa!ve
87 / 600

uses oko mene, where the form mene will be explained later (it’s in the so-called
genitive case).
The fourth and the fifth line use plural forms, which are not yet explained, but for
masculine adjectives and many masculine nouns, it’s simply -i in N plural.
The sixth line has no racist implications whatsoever: everything around the guy is
black and white, no colors – and colors are perceived as good, i.e. color TV’s were
new and better than old black-and-white ones – and the girlfriend is just a part of
the black-and-white world, i.e. she isn’t anything extraordinary. The seventh line
uses program which can mean many things; my translation as (TV) show is only one
possibility.

We are able to say that we are going to school or to work, but what about being in
school, or at work?
It turns out we again need the prepositions u¨ and na¨, but with another noun form
– the dative or locative case (just DL for short) ®. Most books list them as separate
cases, but they are really the same in all everyday situations. (There’s a difference in
tone of some words in Standard Croatian, but most people don’t have it in their
speech.)
This table summarizes rules to put nouns into the DL case, starting from the
nominative (dictionary) form:
noun type (N)
DL
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -i
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) -o or -e → -u
masc. nouns not in -a
add -u
fem. not in -a (e.g. noć)
add -i
As you can see, all nouns get an ending now, and there’s no distinction for people
and animals – that applies only to the accusative case. There are again only two
endings to remember: one for nouns in -a and feminine nouns not in -a, and another
for all other nouns. Let’s take the following nouns:
kolač cake
kuća house
kuhinja kitchen
ladica drawer ®
ormar closet, wardrobe ®
peć f oven, furnace
soba room
stan apartment
With them, and other nouns we have already learned, can make sentences like
these:
Ana je u kući. Ana is in the house.
Ivan je u Zagrebu. Ivan is in Zagreb.
Spavamo u hotelu. We sleep in a hotel.
Riba pliva u moru. A fish is swimming in the sea.
Ivan je u školi. Ivan is at school.
Kuhamo u kuhinji. We’re cooking in the kitchen.
Kolač je u peći. The cake is in the oven.
Of course, we can use objects as well:
Kuham čaj u kuhinji. I’m cooking tea in the kitchen.
Gledamo televiziju u sobi. We’re watching TV in the room.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 15 Loca!ons
89 / 600

You will find this verb useful:
živjeti (živi) live
Verbs having infinitives ending in -jeti have almost always -i in their pres-3, so they
are not really irregular. Let’s put it to use:
Ana živi u Zagrebu. Ana lives in Zagreb.
Živim u Splitu. I live in Split.
As you hopefully remember, some nouns when used as destinations require na¨
instead of u¨. When they are used as locations, you still have to use na¨ with them:
Živimo na Braču. We live on the island of Brač.
Ivana je na plaži. Ivana is on the beach.
Ana je na trgu. Ana is on the (main) town square.
With locations, Croatian u¨ roughly translates as in, and na¨ as on or at. Here are a
couple of ‘activities’ – you finally know how to say on vacation or at university:
Ivan je na fakultetu. Ivan is at university.
Ana je na odmoru. Ana is on vacation.
Goran je na večeri. Goran is on dinner/supper.
Ivan je na putu. Ivan is on a trip.
Don’t forget that certain Croatian nouns require na¨ where English uses in (the Core
Dictionary marks such nouns). For example (nouns are here listed in DL, of course):
na nebu in the sky
na slici in the picture
na svijetu in the world
na ulici in the street
It also applies to appearing on electronic media, including movies and phone:
na filmu in the movie
na radiju on the radio
na telefonu on the phone
na televiziji on TV
The preposition na¨ also applies to weather conditions – being exposed to blowing
wind, sun, etc:
na hladnoći in cold
na kiši in rain
na snijegu in snow
na suncu in sun, exposed to sun
na vjetru exposed to wind
na zraku in (fresh) air
Some nouns can be used with both u¨ and na¨ – then the u¨ gives an ordinary
meaning, and na¨ a derived, metaphorical one:
u moru in the sea (below surface / swimming)
na moru at the seaside; on the sea (sailing)
u selu in the village
na selu in countryside
So, when you tell in Croatian that someone’s na moru he or she can be just on
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 15 Loca!ons
90 / 600

vacation; when somebody is u moru, it’s swimming or diving.
What about at work? Again, we use na¨ with activities like these:
posao (posl-) m work, job
ručak (ručk-) lunch
sastanak (sastank-) meeting
For example:
Ivan je na poslu. Ivan is at work.
Ana je na sastanku. Ana is in a meeting.
Damir je na ručku. Damir is at lunch.
Croatian doesn’t distinguish in a meeting from at the meeting. In fact, Croatian
doesn’t have anything similar to English at – it’s always ‘in the park’, ‘on the beach’
etc.
To ask where something or someone is, just start a question with the following word
(this word varies a lot in everyday speech, e.g. you can hear di colloquially in some
parts of Croatia, including cities of Zagreb, Split and Rijeka):
gdje where ®
Nothing else is needed, there’s no change of word order; as usual in Croatian, it’s
normal to answer with just a location, or you can give a longer answer if you want
to emphasize the rest of the sentence:
Gdje je Ivan? Where is Ivan?
— Na putu. On a trip.
— Na putu je. He’s on a trip.
 
Gdje je Damir?
— Na telefonu. On the phone. (i.e. talking)
Standard Croatian (and many people in speech) always distinguishes gdje where
from kamo where... to, but many people in speech use gdje where for both.
If you have examined the sentences above very carefully, you might have noticed
that the stress of fakultet changed in DL. The same happens to kolač, telefon, and
to many other nouns:
N
+ DL ending
kolač
kolaču
fakultet
fakultetu
telefon
telefonu
koncert
koncertu
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 15 Loca!ons
91 / 600

That’s the rule for virtually all nouns ending in a consonant that have the ‘western’
stress on the last syllable and the Standard stress on the last but one (e.g. fa-kul-
tet): whenever they get any ending (e.g. the DL ending -u), the Standard stress shifts
right, to the ‘western’ position.
You can recognize such nouns easily – they have their last two vowels underlined in
this course. However, if such nouns end in two consonants (e.g. koncert concert),
there’s no stress shift. (Since it’s completely predictable, I will not specially mark it in
a way I do it for verbs.)
There’s another change in DL that applies only to nouns that end in -ka or -ga. For
most of them, their ending changes to -ci or -zi, but only in DL. For example:
Živimo u Americi. We live in America.
Ivan je na slici. Ivan is in the picture.
Goran ima ranu na nozi. Goran has a wound on his leg.
It does not apply to all nouns, there’s no such change in personal names and family
terms like baka grandmother. (Note again how we used just the noun noga, and
English always likes a possessive, e.g. his, before parts of body.)
Unfortunately, we are still not able to say that we’re in Croatia, but I will explain it in
a short while, don’t worry.
________
® In informal speech in Montenegro, locations are often formed as destinations, i.e.
with A. For example:
Zoran živi u Podgoricu. (A) Zoran lives in Podgorica.
This is not standard in Montenegro, but you will find it in popular songs, movies and
writing.
While ladica is used in Serbia as well, the word fioka is much more common there
for the drawer.
Besides ormar, orman is also used in Bosnia, Serbia and parts of Croatia, mostly in
speech.
In Montenegro, the form đe where prevails and is used as standard.
• Something Possibly Interesting
Some people claim that dative and locative are really two cases, despite having
identical forms, since they have different functions. However, the accusative case
has more than one function as well, but nobody wants to split it into several cases.
(We’ll later see that other cases have more than one function too.)
Still, in all modern Croatian grammars published in Croatia (the same holds for
Serbian grammars published in Serbia) the dative and locative cases are listed
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 15 Loca!ons

separately in tables of noun and adjective endings. I mean, really separately – D is in
the third row, and L in the sixth row. (In Serbia, L is often in the last, seventh, row!)
Incredibly, even some web pages intended for foreigners who try to learn Croatian
list these cases separately, having maybe just a small remark somewhere “these two
cases have the same endings”.
It’s as if some people are trying to make the language more complex than it really is.
For instance, this table I found on the Internet has the D and L cases separately, but
it also has an error – it says that the D of nouns in -a (‘Class II’ in the table) has the
ending -u, which is, of course, wrong (it has -i):
Also, ‘functions’ listed in the table are quite misleading in many ways. (Just in a case
somebody might find this table here and share it, I’ve added the overlay don’t use
this.) Such things are some of reasons I’ve decided to write this small ‘course’.
It’s also interesting that this distinction of D and L applies to modern grammars. In
Institutionum linguae illyricae libri duo – a grammar published in 1604 by
Bartholomaeus Cassius, usually known in Croatia as Bartol Kašić – there’s only one
case listed in singular.
Swedish also distinguishes where (var) from where... to (vart).

There’s another use of the dative/locative case (DL), but without any prepositions:
you can state recipient of some action, for instance if you write a letter to someone,
you must express someone in DL in Croatian:
AnaN piše pismoA IvanuDL. Ana is writing a letter to Ivan.
AnaN piše pismoA IvaniDL. Ana is writing a letter to Ivana.
When you rearrange words in English, you don’t need to use to anymore, but case
forms in Croatian don’t change at all:
AnaN piše pismoA IvanuDL. Ana is writing a letter to Ivan.
AnaN piše IvanuDL pismoA. Ana is writing Ivan a letter. (a bit less common
order)
Since words can be shuffled, to help you recognize cases, there are offline versions
(i.e. PDF and Kindle file) which mark cases in examples with superscript letters (N,
A, DL...) – they are recognized by ‘an’ in the file name. There are also versions
without these additional marks. Pick the version you prefer. Online, cases are
marked by colors.
Such use of DL is quite common with the following verbs, where something is given
(or shown, or offered) to someone:
davati (daje) give
nuditi offer
pokazivati (pokazuje) show
prodavati (prodaje) sell
vraćati return
slati (šalje) send
The following nouns are also useful:
čestitka (DL -ci) greeting card
dar gift
poklon gift
poruka (DL -ci) message
razglednica (picture) postcard
The verbs are used simply: what goes/is offered/shown to another person (gift,
postcard, whatever) is put in the accusative case, and the recipient in DL:
AnaN šalje čestitkuA IvanuDL. Ana is sending a greeting card to Ivan.
AnaN daje poklonA GoranuDL. Ana is giving a gift to Goran.
Croatian has two more verbs that have a very similar meaning to davati (daje), but
with them what’s given is a gift, possibly for a special occasion:
darivati (daruje)  
poklanjati
   make a gift, donate
The verb poklanjati is a bit more common in speech, and the other verb in formal
writing and newspapers. For example:
AnaN poklanja knjiguA GoranuDL. Ana is giving a book to Goran (as a gift).

pomagati

There’s a very rough but often effective rule: when an English verb takes two objects
– and you order them without the word to – the first object corresponds to the
Croatian DL case, and the second one to the A case:
I’m writing
Ana
a letter.
He told
Ivan
the truth.
She will buy
Goran
a new bike.
I wish
you
a nice day.
In Croatian:
 DL
    A
Of course, I haven’t explained past and future tenses yet, and I haven’t shown forms
of pronouns in various cases – but it doesn’t matter, case use doesn’t depend on the
tense, and whether you use nouns or pronouns. It’s always the same scheme.
There are two more useful verbs that use DL, but it does not have anything to do
with receiving something – it’s just the way the verbs are. They are:
pomagati (pomaže) help
pripadati belong
For example:
AnaN pomaže GoranuDL. Ana is helping Goran.
AutoN pripada AniDL. The car belongs to Ana.
(German uses here the same grammar as Croatian: German verbs gehören and
helfen use the German Dative case. However, keep in mind that German cases are
really not identical to Croatian cases!)
The DL case is used in thanking, which is useful when you get something. The phrase
is:
hvala na¨ + DL thanks for
Croatian za¨ usually corresponds to English for, but not in this phrase. For example,
you could say:
Hvala na... Thanks for the...
    ... čestitciDL. ...greeting card.
    ... poruciDL. ...message.
    ... poklonuDL. ...gift.
    ... pomoćiDL. ...help.
Here we’ve used another feminine noun that doesn’t end in -a: pomoć f help,
assistance.
The DL case is also involved with possession, especially with body parts and related
people (e.g. family or friends). I already explained how in Croatian, words like my
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 16 Giving to Someone, Going to Someone
95 / 600

prati
prati
are less often used and possession is implied:
AnaN pere kosuA. ‘Ana is washing hair.’ (= her hair)
However, if she’s washing someone else’s hair, a common way – very common in
speech – to express it, is to add the person in the DL case:
AnaN pere GoranuDL kosuA. Ana is washing hair ‘to Goran’. (= Goran’s hair)
This is the preferred word order in such sentences – it’s, of course, possible to
rearrange words if you want to stress something. This is the same structure as with
the verb send or write – Goran will ‘get’ his hair washed, in the same way as he will
get a message, letter or gift.
Pay attention that in the sentence above, kosu is in A – it is the object, after all –
while Goranu is in DL. These two words are not attached to each other, don’t
depend on each other: this is just the most common word order in such
sentences.
Croatian has possessive adjectives – I’ve already shown moj my, others will be
shown a bit later – but with body parts, this is the preferred way. If you are familiar
with German, you’ll notice it uses the same system: the sentence above would
translate exactly as Ana wäscht Goran die Haare. Dutch and Romance languages do
it in the same way.
In fact, English is famous for using a lot of possessive adjectives, while a great
majority of European languages use them much less often. In most languages,
possession of body parts and many other things is simply implied – it’s expressed
only if something belongs to someone else, often by dative or something equivalent.
If your brain is spinning now failing to comprehend how DL can mean possession
of a body part, here’s another way to look at the sentence above: Ana is washing
the hair, and doing it to Goran.
The accusative case of neuter nouns is equal to their default, nominative form. It’s
not so for the DL case, and it becomes important that some neuter nouns have
specific case-base as well, not shortened (like masculine ones) but lengthened:
dijete (djetet-) child
pile (pilet-) chicken
Pay attention how ije in dijete changes to je in its case-base (such alternations are a
cause of misspellings for many native speakers).
The next two verbs have a obligatory se² always with them (as explained already, it
must be the second word, if possible):
diviti se² marvel, admire
smijati (smije) se² laugh ®
For example:
GoranN se divi IvanuDL. Goran marvels at Ivan.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 16 Giving to Someone, Going to Someone
96 / 600

smijati se
ići
trčati
ići
ići
AnaN se smije GoranuDL. Ana is laughing at Goran.
So in Croatian – if the DL case kind of corresponds to English to — you literally
‘marvel to someone’ and ‘laugh to someone’... (which sounds wrong in English, of
course).
There’s another, completely different use of the DL case. It is possible with verbs of
motion:
ići (ide) go
trčati (trči) run
If you are going or running to someone, it’s expressed in Croatian ® with DL:
AnaN ide IvanuDL. Ana is going to Ivan. (where he is)
Trčim mamiDL. I’m running to my Mum.
(You see again that it’s implied whose Mum it is.)
It’s often used when you go to some shop or office held by someone, e.g.:
frizer hairdresser
zubar dentist
For example:
IvanN sutra ide zubaruDL. Ivan is going to the dentist tomorrow.
As with other masculine nouns that have two last vowels underlined (in my
notation), the stress moves – you can see it in the example (zubar → zubaru).
As a very special use, the DL of the noun kuća house can be used as destination: it
means home, even if you live in an apartment:
AnaN danas ide kućiDL. Ana is going home today.
The same meaning, especially in western and northern regions of Croatia, can be
expressed with the following adverb:
doma home (as destination)
There’s yet another use of the DL case, with certain nouns and adjectives. For
example, this adjective is often accompanied by a noun in DL (this again corresponds
to English to):
sličan (sličn-) similar
For example:
VišnjaN je slična trešnjiDL. Sour cherry is similar to cherry.
In the previous sentence, trešnja cherry was put in DL.
________
® In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, which completely dominates in Serbia, the verb
smijati (smije) se² has the unexpected form smejati (smeje) se².
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 16 Giving to Someone, Going to Someone

The use of DL of persons to express destinations seems to be much less common in
Serbia, especially in speech.
• Something Possibly Interesting
There is a common idea that Croatian and similar languages can reorder words
almost freely (like in the examples above, Ana piše pismo Ivanu or Ana piše Ivanu
pismo) because they have case markings, so it’s obvious what you write and who
will get it.
However, e.g. Icelandic has case endings that distinguish accusative and dative, but
such reordering is not possible in Icelandic! It just seems that Germanic languages
are rigid in various ways, for an unknown reason. Most languages in the world are
much less rigid than e.g. English.
• Examples
You’ll often see the message hvala na posjeti written in restaurants, cafe bars and
hotels, literally thanks for the visit. For example:
The noun posjeta visit is considered somewhat colloquial by many language
manuals (i.e. books and web pages telling Croatians how they should speak) but it’s
very widely used.

17 Adjectives in Dative/Locative
If we want to use adjectives with nouns in dative/locative (DL), we must put them to
the DL form as well. Their endings are quite simple, but really different from the
noun endings:
gender
adj. DL
example
fem.
-oj
velikoj ribi 
big fish
neut.
-om
(some -em)
velikom jezeru 
big lake
masc.
velikom zidu 
big wall
As I wrote before – there’s no difference between the two masculine genders (one
for people and animals, one for others) – it applies to accusative only. Actually, in
most cases (N and A are exceptions), there are only two forms of adjectives: one for
feminine gender, another for all others. So, adjective forms are much simpler than
they could be: you need to remember only two endings for adjectives in DL.
For example:
IvanN živi u maloj kućiDL. Ivan lives in a small house.
AnaN živi u velikom stanuDL. Ana lives in a big apartment.
The ending -em applies to adjectives that end in a Croatian-specific letter, in exactly
the same way as in the accusative case, and neuter nominative.
As in other cases of adjectives, you’ll see sometimes, in writing, longer endings: -
omu, -ome and -emu.®
The ending -oj is very specific for fem. DL: if you see it on an adjective, you can be
quite sure that it – and the nouns following it – are in DL. Of course, there are few
nouns that end in -oj in N (e.g. broj number, stroj machine, etc.)
Like in A, the possessive moj my, besides the expected form mojem in the masc.
and neut., has a shortened form mom, which is much more frequent, without any
difference in meaning.
Bus and train stations and stops are frequently used locations: terms for them in
Croatian combine an adjective (sometimes left out if it’s obvious what kind of
station it is) and a noun:
autobusniʷ¹ adj. bus ®
željeznički adj. train
kolodvor station, terminal ®
stanica stop
They are always used with the preposition na¨. For instance:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 17 Adjec!ves in Da!ve/Loca!ve
100 / 600

Čekamo na autobusnomʷ¹ kolodvoruDL. We’re waiting at the bus station.
The train terminal in Zagreb is called Glavni kolodvor (Main station, again adj. +
noun), and a tram stop is tramvajska stanica. Instead of stanica, the word postaja is
sometimes used, especially in official announcements.
We can finally solve the mystery of how to say in Croatia in Croatian! The problem is
that the word Hrvatska is really an adjective. It’s used as a country name, but it still
changes like an adjective (put to the feminine gender). Therefore, we should say:
AnaN živi u HrvatskojDL. Ana lives in Croatia.
Some other countries that have a name that’s really a (feminine) adjective are:
Češka Czech Republic
Engleska England
Francuska France
Grčka Greece
Irska Ireland
Mađarska Hungary
Nizozemska Netherlands ®
Njemačka Germany
Poljska Poland
Španjolska Spain ®
Švedska Sweden
Švicarska Switzerland ®
For instance:
MadridN je u ŠpanjolskojDL. Madrid is in Spain.
This applies to all country names that end on either -ska, -čka or -ška. Such nouns
are historically just shortened forms of e.g. poljska zemlja Polish country. Not all
countries have such names, many behave as normal nouns:
Bosna Bosnia
Brazil Brazil
Italija Italy
Kina China
Rusija Russia
Srbija Serbia
Certain place names in Croatia and neighboring countries behave like adjectives,
e.g.:
Makarska → DL Makarskoj
Novi Vinodolski → DL Novom Vinodolskom
Occasionally, a name can consist of two adjectives (e.g. the seaside town Novi
Vinodolski above).
Some countries (and cities!) have names that consist of an adjective + a noun. Each
will get specific endings. Such names are e.g. Crna Gora Montenegro and Velika
Gorica, a city next to Zagreb:
IvanaN je u Velikoj GoriciDL. Ivana is in Velika Gorica.
PredragN živi u Crnoj GoriDL. Predrag lives in Montenegro.
Names of lakes, seas and oceans in Croatian are also often made of an adjective
and a noun:
Jadransko more Adriatic sea → u Jadranskom moru
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 17 Adjec!ves in Da!ve/Loca!ve
101 / 600

Atlantski ocean Atlantic ocean → u Atlantskom oceanu ®
There are more nouns in Croatian that are (historically) adjectives and therefore
change as adjectives. For example, the name of the month of November in Croatian
changes as an adjective. To inform you about it, I will indicate such behavior with
(adj.) after the noun:
studeni (adj.) November ®
Another very frequent use of nouns-that-are-actually-adjectives are names of
languages. The full name of a language is e.g.:
engleski jezik the English language
talijanskiʷ¹ jezik the Italian language
They are very often shortened just to adjectives (e.g. engleski, talijanskiʷ¹) which
keep the gender of the noun jezik – masculine inanimate. Such adjectives that stand
for countries of origin and languages are:
češki Czech
engleski English
francuski French
hrvatski Croatian
njemački German
ruski Russian
srpski Serbian
španjolski Spanish ®
švedski Swedish
talijanskiʷ¹ Italian
If you compare them to the country names above, you can verify that the country
names are actually just feminine versions of these adjectives. For a comprehensive
list of country names and associated adjectives, check L2 Countries and
Nationalities.
To say that something is in some language, you should use na¨ + adjective in masc.
DL:
KnjigaN je na njemačkomDL. The book is in German.
If you want to ask how to say some word on some other language (including
Croatian) you should use a sentence like this:
Kako se kaže „carrot”N na hrvatskomDL?
(Such sentences exactly correspond to Italian come si dice and Spanish cómo se dice,
so you will find another similarity to those languages.)
If you want to say that you speak or don’t speak a language, you should use the verb
znati know:
Učim hrvatskiA. I’m learning Croatian.
Znam engleskiA. I ‘know’ English. (= I speak
AnaN ne zna ruskiA. Ana doesn’t ‘know’ Russian. (= doesn’t speak)
(I hope you remember that this verb shifts the stress to ne¨ in both Standard and
‘western’ stress scheme.)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 17 Adjec!ves in Da!ve/Loca!ve
102 / 600

ići
Adjectives in the three sentences above were in the accusative case; it’s here
identical to the nominative, since the noun jezik is a masculine noun, not standing
for an animal or people (parts of people don’t count!) so it has accusative identical
to the nominative case.
Adjectives listed above can be used anywhere where you want to express that
something belongs or originates from a country, e.g.:
AmélieN je francuski filmN. Amélie is a French movie.
Adjectives like njemački are often used with the preposition na¨, to mean language
lessons: either as directions (going to) or locations (attending):
GoranN je na engleskomDL. Goran is in the English class/lesson.
Sutra idem na engleskiA. I’m going to the English class/lesson tomorrow.
The usual distinction of na¨ + A vs. na¨ + DL applies, of course, and adjectives are in
the masculine inanimate gender.
However, such adjectives cannot be used on their own to describe persons, you
cannot use the word hrvatski for people (e.g. for Croat, or Croatian, a person from
Croatia)! Croatian uses specific nouns for that. Here are just ones for Croat, Bosnian
and Serb; as you maybe expect, there are specific words for males and females:
male
female
Croat
Hrvat
Hrvatica
Bosnian
Bosanac (Bosanc-) Bosanka
Serb
Srbin
Srpkinja
For a comprehensive list of names of persons of various nationalities, check L2
Countries and Nationalities.
________
® Such longer endings of adjectives are extremely rare in Serbia and Bosnia.
Instead of autobusniʷ¹, a slightly different adjective is used in Serbia: autobuski.
Both forms are used in Bosnia.
The word kolodvor is specific to Croatia: in Bosnia and Serbia, just stanica is used.
Instead of ocean, a slightly different word okean is used in Serbia and most of
Bosnia (note that Croatian c is a completely different sound than k).
The word studeni for the month of November is used only in Croatia (rarely in
Bosnia).
Instead of Nizozemska, Španjolska and Švicarska, words Holandija, Španija and
Švajcarska are used in Serbia and most of Bosnia, and the first two words behave as
normal nouns; instead of španjolski, adjective španski prevails there.

18 This and That
Croatian has three useful demonstrative adjectives. Let’s list them and compare with
not only English, but also Spanish demonstratives (as they are more similar to
Croatian); I’ll list with them another adjective with a related meaning:
Croatian
English
Spanish
ovaj (ov-)
this
este/esta
taj (t-)
that
ese/esa
onaj (on-) that over there (yonder) aquel/aquella
drugi
other
otro/otra
They can be used as normal adjectives:
Ona kućaN je velikaN. That house is big.
MarkoN živi u ovom stanuDL. Marko lives in this apartment.
Unlike most other adjectives, the three adjectives listed above – ovaj (ov-), taj (t-)
and onaj (on-) – cannot get -i in masculine nominative singular. (Recall that the
same restriction applies to moj my).
As in English, it’s quite common in Croatian to use certain adjectives on their own,
without any noun, as pronouns (compare to English each, others, and so on).
However, regardless how they are used, words that are originally adjectives still
change as adjectives, that is, get case endings for adjectives.
Demonstrative adjectives, in the neuter gender (i.e. ovo, to, etc.) are often used as
generic pronouns, in questions, explaining things, etc.; the adjective-used-as-
pronoun to is frequently translated with English it:
ToN je mačkaN. It’s a cat.
OvoN je pasN. This is a dog.
I’ll call such sentences demonstrative. They behave a bit strange: nouns in them (e.g.
mačka, pas) are subjects, so the verb biti (je² +) be agrees with them. It applies to
using to with another pronoun as well:
ToN sam jaN. It’s me. (lit. ‘It I am.’)
If you use to + adjectives, it’s a different type of sentence: you are talking about
something else, already known. Now the word to is the subject, be careful that you
use the neuter gender of adjectives:
OvoN je teškoN. This is heavy/hard.
This is completely different from how e.g. pronouns ja I or ti you (singular) behave:
with them, you have to think what the pronoun represents, and adjust the gender
accordingly. With to you have to use the neuter gender, regardless of what the
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 18 This and That
105 / 600

zvati
zvati
poznavati
pronoun represents!
This is very often used to express that something belongs to someone, using
possessive adjectives:
ToN je mojeN. It’s mine.
(Recall that moj gets -e in neuter, since it ends in a Croatian-specific consonant.)
Croatian has the 3rd person neuter pronoun ono it, but demonstrative
adjective/pronoun in the neuter gender – to – prevails in use instead.
You can use to (or ovo, etc.), with the verb zvati (zove) call + se² to express what is
the name or word for something:
OvoN se zove džepN. This is called a pocket.
To ask what is something called, use kako how (again, as in Spanish or Italian):
Kako se toN zove (na hrvatskomDL)? What is that called (in Croatian)?
Although Croatian has no articles – words like English the, a or an – you can use taj
(t-) or onaj (on-) as an adjective, if you want to emphasize that something is strictly
defined, already known:
Čekam taj vlakA. I’m waiting for that train.
Ona ženaN je ovdje. That/The woman is here.
The opposite can be expressed with two adjectives that express that something is
not really known:
jedan (jedn-) one
neki some
For instance:
Neka ženaN je ovdje. A woman is here. (or some woman...)
The adjective jedan (jedn-) one also serves as a number – for instance, you can say
that you have one son (recall, masculine nouns standing for people or animals
change in accusative):
Imam jednog sinaA. I have one son. (or a son)
In Croatian, demonstrative and possessive adjectives can be combined freely, unlike
in English, so you can say:
jedna moja knjiga one of my books (lit. ‘one my book’)
jedan moj prijatelj one of my (male) friends (lit. ‘one my friend’)
ta moja knjiga lit. ‘that my book’
The last phrase is hard to translate, but the meaning is obvious: a specific book that
belongs to me. For example:
Poznaješ jednog mog dobrog prijateljaA. You know a good friend of
mine. (lit. ‘one my good friend’)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 18 This and That
106 / 600

f
The normal order of adjectives in such phrases is demonstrative-possessive-
descriptive, but it can be changed in principle.
There’s another, very subtle way to express indefiniteness of the subject in
sentences without objects – put the subject after the verb:
Dolazi vlakN. A train is coming. ®
(This explains the common order of words in sentences like pada kiša lit. ‘a rain is
falling.’)
The adjective drugi is often translated as English another. While English e.g. another
apple is a bit ambiguous, Croatian drugi means not this one, and Croatian uses još +
jedan (jedn-) in meaning one more:
Želim drugu olovkuA. I want another pencil. (a different pencil)
Želim još jednuA olovkuA. I want another pencil. (one more)
We have used here the following noun and verb:
olovka pencil
željeti (želi) want
The adjective jedan (jedn-) one can be negated, by appending ni-:
nijedan (nijedn-) + negation not even one
Like with other negative words starting with ni-, the verb must be negated too:
Nemam nijednu olovkuA. I don’t have a single pencil. (lit. ‘I don’t have not even one
pencil.’)
Ne znam nijednu riječA. I don’t know a single word. (lit. ‘I don’t know not even
one word.’)
While jedan (jedn-) usually translates as one, Croatian has no “noun” like English
one. When you would use this one, another one in English, only the adjective-as-
pronoun corresponding to this or another is used in Croatian – but don’t forget to
adjust its case and gender! For example:
Želim ovu jabukuA. I want this apple.
Želim ovuA. I want this one. (lit. ‘this’, fem. A)
Želim drugog učiteljaA. I want another teacher.
Želim drugogA. I want another one. (lit. ‘other’, masc.anim. A)
Želim još jedno pivoA. I want one more beer.
Želim još jednoA. I want one more. (lit. ‘one’, neut. A)
This is one instance when it’s clear why adjectives show gender in Croatian – they
are more specific when used without nouns.
The words jedan (jedn-) and nijedan (nijedn-) are often used in short replies, buy
pay attention that they of course adjust to the gender of the thing they refer to
(here olovka pencil = feminine):

— Nemam nijednuA. I don’t have any. (lit. ‘I don’t have not even one.’)
The neuter form to (properly changed for case, of course) is also used to refer to
facts, statements, events and actions:
Kuham čajA. I’m making tea. (lit. ‘cooking tea’) ®
— ToN je dobroN! That’s good!
Here, the word to refers to what is previously said. Only to can be used in such
references, ovo or ono cannot be used.
Croatian has specific demonstrative adverbs for manner (how) and quantity (how
much/many) that don’t have exact English counterparts:
manner
quantity
ovako in this way, like this
ovoliko this much/many
tako in that way, so
toliko so much/many
onako in that way, like that
onoliko that much/many
Out of them, ovako, tako and toliko are most often used. For example:
Ovaj autoN je tako brzN. This car is so fast.
In fact, Croatian has a wide array of demonstrative adverbs, covering every category
of adverbs: destination, origin, reason, location, time, etc. Some of them are
frequently used, others less so.
However, certain meanings are expressed with a demonstrative + noun, and the
whole phrase gets a special meaning. The noun put (meaning way on its own) is
often used in such phrases:
ovaj put this time (around)
taj put that time
Croatian has also demonstrative adjectives corresponding to quality and size:
ovakav (ovakv-) such, like this
ovolik this big
Don’t forget these words are adjectives, that is, change in gender, case and number.
For example:
Imam ovakvu majicuA. I have such a shirt.
Other forms are derived in the same way as for other types of demonstratives, i.e.
by replacing ov- with t- or on-.
Don’t worry too much about the difference between ovakav (ovakv-) and takav
(takv-) – they are often used interchangeably by Croatians.

English has specific time adverbs for ‘on, during this day’ (today) and ‘this night’
(tonight). Croatian has a bit expanded scheme. They all end in -s:
danas today
noćas tonight
jutros this morning
večeras this evening
For example:
Večeras idemo u restoranA. We’re going to the restaurant this evening.
The word to is also used in the phrase to jest (where jest is an archaic form of je²,
the pres-3 of biti).
Another demonstrative, tako, is used in another frequent phrase, i tako dalje. Both
are very common expressions, so they have standard abbreviations (the periods are
mandatory; matching English abbreviations are also given):

• Something Possibly Interesting
English the is basically just a worn down, reduced version of that that somehow
became obligatory before many nouns and so became an ‘article’. Many languages,
from Croatian to Hindi and Korean, have no articles whatsoever. This map in the
World Atlas of Language Structures illustrates the distribution of languages with and
without articles: Definite Articles.
In Italian, you have to use an article before my friend – either indefinite un mio
amico or definite il mio amico. Overall, Croatian grammar is much closer to
Romance languages than to English.

19 Your, Ana’s: Possessives
We know how to say the red apple, even my apple, but not your apple or Ana’s
apple. So, let’s learn it.
As I have already explained, words like my (or Ana’s) are simply adjectives in
Croatian (more accurately, possessive adjectives). They are not adjectives in English,
where you cannot say the my apple, but you can say the red apple. That’s one
example where Croatian is simpler than English.
As the rule, possessive adjectives never get the optional -i in masc. N.
Each possessive adjective corresponds to one pronoun. There are three sets of
pronouns with similar forms; the first set is:
pronoun
possessive
ja I
moj my
ti you (sg.) tvoj your
—
svoj
All three end in -j, so they get -em and -eg instead of -om and -og, but, like moj, the
other two adjectives above have additional, shortened forms in neuter and
masculine genders as well:
alt. endings for moj, tvoj, svoj
masc. / neut. DL:
-ojem = -om
masc. p/a A:
-ojeg = -og
You can use them as any adjective:
Čekamo tvog brataA. We’re waiting for your brother.
Čekamo tvojeg brataA. (the same meaning)
Pišem porukuA tvojoj sestriDL. I’m writing a message to your sister.
The following two adjectives don’t have any special forms, they change as normal
adjectives (of course, since they end in an -š, they get -em and -eg in neuter and
masculine):
pronoun
possessive
mi we
naš our
vi you (pl./resp.) vaš your (i.e. y’all’s)
The last set contains the 3rd person pronouns. Here Croatian does not distinguish
neuter from masculine possessive:

pisati

pronoun
possessive
ona she
njen her
njezin her ®
ono it
njegov its/his
on he
one they (f)
ona they (n)
oni they (m)
njihov their
For example:
KnjigaN je njihovaN. The book is ‘their’. (= theirs)
Čitam njegovu porukuA. I’m reading his message.
There are two possessive adjectives that correspond to ona she. Both are used, you
can use any you like.®
If you were careful, there was a mysterious possessive svoj. It should be used when
something belongs to the subject of the sentence. For instance, if Ana is writing a
letter to her brother, you would use it:
AnaN piše pismoA svom bratuDL. Ana is writing a letter to her (= Ana’s)
brother.
In real life, it’s not always used in 1st and 2nd person, so you will hear and
sometimes read e.g.:
Pišem pismoA mom bratuDL. (colloq.) I’m writing a letter to my brother.
The main purpose of svoj is distinguishing between two or more possible possessors
in a sentence – it always points to the subject:
AnaN vraća IvaniDL svoj ključA. Ana is returning her (= Ana’s) key to Ivana.
AnaN vraća IvaniDL njen ključA. Ana is returning her (= Ivana’s) key to Ivana.
The reflexive possessive svoj doesn’t distinguish owner’s gender and number, i.e. it’s
the same in masc. and fem., singular and plural – and that elegantly solves a classic
problem in English, obvious in these three sentences:
Everyone loves his mother. or
Everyone loves his or her mother. or
Everyone loves their mother. ?
The first option is problematic since everyone includes women too; the second
option is too long, and the third option is condemned by some. Croatian simply uses:
SvatkoN voli svoju majkuA.
(The indefinite pronoun svatko will be explained in 41 Somewhere, Nobody,
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 19 Your, Ana’s: Possessives
112 / 600

Everything...)
How to make possessives out of names? In English, you just add ’s, but it’s slightly
more complicated in Croatian. It’s simplest for names ending in -a: just replace it
with the -in, and (usually) you’re done. It works also for nouns in -a standing for
people (e.g. tata Dad):
Ana → Anin
Ivana → Ivanin
Luka → Lukin
mama Mom → mamin
sestra sister → sestrin
tata Dad → tatin
For nouns and names that end in -ca, the c changes to č when -in is added:
Anica → Aničin
prijateljica friend (f) → prijateljičin
The noun majka mother also has a change in consonants, but not other nouns
ending in -ka:
majka mother → majčin
baka grandmother → bakin
What about male names that change as if ending in -a, like Ante? They also make
possessives with -in:
Čekamo Antinu sestruA. We’re waiting for Ante’s sister.
This also usually applies for female names that don’t end in -a and therefore don’t
change at all (however, some people use alternative methods, to be described a bit
later), e.g.
Doris → Dorisin
Ines → Inesin
For male names ending in a consonant or names like Marko, you should add an -ov
(or -ev after Croatian-specific letters). It works for nouns standing for people as
well:
Goran → Goranov
Ivan → Ivanov
Marko → Markov
Hrvoje → Hrvojev
sin son → sinov
prijatelj friend (m) → prijateljev
If a noun ends in -c (or its case-base), it turns to č when -ev is added:
otac (oc-) father (formal) → očev
princ prince → prinčev
All these words are adjectives, they change in case and gender! For example:
Čekamo Aninu sestruA. We’re waiting for Ana’s sister.
Sjedim u Hrvojevoj kuhinjiDL. I’m sitting in Hrvoje’s kitchen.
AnaN je Goranova mamaN. Ana is Goran’s mom.
Since they are adjectives, they are more flexible than English possessives:

AutoN je AninN. The car ‘is Ana’s’. (= belongs to Ana)
I’ve already explained that possession of body parts is usually expressed with the DL
case. Is there any difference in meaning when possessive adjectives are used?
Usually, there’s no difference, and DL is preferred with such nouns. However, here’s
a difference in some circumstances: DL implies a kind of close possession, while
possessive adjectives don’t. Compare these sentences:
(1) AnaN pere GoranuDL kosuA. Ana is washing Goran’s hair. (lit. ‘washing the
hair to Goran’)
(2) AnaN pere Goranovu kosuA. (lit. ‘washing Goran’s hair’ – the same
meaning?)
They don’t mean exactly the same. The sentence #1 implies that the hair is growing
from Goran’s head, while the sentence #2 could also apply to cut hair being washed
for whatever reason.
This is a very fine distinction not important in most circumstances. (The ‘close
possession’ is sometimes called ‘inalienable’, but the name is not precise – the hair
can be cut.)
Pay attention: in the DL possession, used for body parts, the noun for person is
simply in DL (Goran → Goranu). When you use a possessive adjective – which
you have to do to express possession of a ball, dog, house etc. – you have first to
turn the person into a possessive (Goran → Goranov) and then add the right
ending for case and gender to it (e.g. Goranov → Goranovu for feminine A).
With relatives, it’s normal to use poss. adjectives, as above (check the sentence
about Ana’s sister). I’ll explain later when it’s more common to use DL for relatives
as well.
Possessives in Croatian are often used in street names, for example Branimir street
– one of major streets in Zagreb – is actually Branimirova ulica Branimir’s street.
The word ulica street is often dropped when it’s obvious what we’re talking about.
(With specific streets, you should use the preposition u¨):
IvanN živi u Branimirovoj uliciDL. Ivan lives on ‘Branimirova’ street.
IvanN živi u BranimirovojDL. (the same meaning, but shorter)
There’s just one problem: you can create a possessive adjective in Croatian from a
single noun only. In English, you can just turn the last word into a possessive, but not
so in Croatian. Here’s what I mean:
mačka cat → mačkin cat’s
crna mačka black cat → ? black cat’s
Croatian uses a completely different construction for the latter phrase, and we’ll
learn it immediately.

20 At My Friend’s: Genitive
There’s another case to learn, and it’s a very useful case. It’s used in constructions
like my sister’s apartment and car keys, but also in measuring, counting, with many
prepositions, etc. It’s called genitive (just G for short). In some other languages (e.g.
German) the genitive case is mainly associated with possession. In Croatian,
expressing possession is just one of many uses of the genitive case, and it’s not its
main use!
Nouns get the following endings in genitive:
noun type (N)
G
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -e
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) -o or -e → -a
masc. nouns not in -a
add -a
fem. not in -a (e.g. noć)
add -i
As for the DL case, the endings of most masc. nouns and or neuter nouns are the
same, and there’s no distinction for people and animals.
We can put it immediately to use. First, it’s used when English uses something-of-
something, e.g.:
kraj filma end of the movie
The second word is always in G, regardless of the role the whole phrase gets. If you
use the phrase when e.g. the DL case is required, only the first word changes:
ToN je na krajuDL filmaG. That’s at the end of the movie.
This construction is frequently used when something ‘belongs’ to something, but it’s
not possession:
broj telefona phone number
vlasnik bicikla bicycle owner
ključ auta car key
vrh planine mountain top
While in such expressions in English, phone and car are used like adjectives, in
Croatian they are nouns in genitive (lit. number of the phone, top of the mountain,
etc.) If you want to describe a noun (e.g. vrh peak) with an adjective, you need to
adapt the adjective to the noun gender and case, and normally place it in front of
the noun (in poetry and some other circumstances, the adjective can be after the
noun):
visoki vrh (N, N)
na visokom vrhu (DL, DL)
But if you describe a noun with another noun, you should put it after the noun, in the
G case, and it stays in the G case, no matter what! (Another way is to turn the noun
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 20 At My Friend’s: Geni!ve
116 / 600

bojati se
into an adjective and follow the previous procedure: it’s described in 33 School Yard:
Relational Adjectives):
vrh planine (N, G)
na vrhu planine (DL, G)
Now, there’s a problem. The form planine also means mountains (that is, plural, as
you’ll see very soon). So, is it on the top, followed by the plural noun mountains, or
the noun + G construction on the top of the mountain? In such cases, always assume
it’s noun + G, of course, if it makes sense.
The G case is also used by several verbs. The often used ones are:
bojati (boji) se² be afraid
sjećati se² have memories, remember
The first verb always uses the particle se². For example:
GoranN se boji mrakaG. Goran is afraid of dark.
Perhaps the most common use of the genitive case in Croatian is with prepositions.
In fact, only a limited number of prepositions in Croatian demand cases other than
G. You’ll see that the genitive case is the default case if a preposition, adverb or
number is used before a noun. A very common preposition is:
kod¨ + G (roughly) at/by
This preposition covers many meanings. It’s very often used to specify location by a
prominent feature, or someone’s home, shop or office:
Čekam AnuA kod mostaG. I’m waiting for Ana by the bridge.
AnaN je kod zubaraG. Ana is at the dentist’s.
GoranN je kod teteG. Goran is at his aunt’s. (place)
If you refer to someone’s house or apartment as a location, it’s normal just to use
such an expression, without stating is it a kuća house or a stan apartment, or
something else. In this manner, the Croatian preposition kod¨ is very similar to the
French chez.
Also, if you know some German, you’ll see it’s also very similar to e.g. German beim
Zahnarzt; however, the German preposition bei requires the German Dative case –
Croatian and German cases are not equivalent in some constructions.
When kod¨ is used before people, the ‘location’ can be understood figuratively –
including inside someone’s pocket or purse – so it sometimes corresponds to English
have:
KljučN je kod AneG. (roughly) Ana has the key.
However, this can be used only for temporary possession of movable things. You
cannot use such expression to say Ana has a brother or Ana has a new house, but
you can use it for e.g. cars:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 20 At My Friend’s: Geni!ve
117 / 600

m
Tvoj autoN je kod AneG. (roughly) Ana has (= is using) your car.
There’s a special phrase kod kuće – it means simply at home, regardless if you’re
living in a house or not:
Nisam kod kućeG. I’m not at home.
We must not forget adjectives in G; they get quite different endings:
gender
adj. G
example
fem.
-e
velike ribe
big fish
neut.
-og
(some -eg)
velikog jezera
big lake
masc.
velikog konja
big horse
The endings -og vs. -eg in neut. and masc. follow the usual rule as in other cases in
neut. and masc. genders. Again, you will sometimes see longer endings -oga and -
ega, mainly in writing.
The G case is used when something is related to descriptions or teaching a language.
Recall that languages are usually referred to simply by adjectives:
gramatika španjolskog Spanish grammar
udžbenik hrvatskog Croatian textbook
With nouns rječnik dictionary and gramatika grammar you can also use just
adjectives before them – then adjectives change case as nouns do:
španjolska gramatika Spanish grammar
The possessive adjectives similar to moj my have a specific, shortened form in neut.
and masc. genders in the G too:
gender
N
G
neut.
moje
mog
mojeg
masc.
moj
This example combines a preposition, possessive adjective and a noun:
AnaN je kod moje sestreG. ‘Ana is at my sister’s.’
We can finally say your sister’s apartment. In Croatian you can make a possessive
only out of single nouns. If you want to express possession by something expressed
by more than one word, you must put them to G, regardless of the case of the
possessed noun and place them after the possessed noun. Here tvoja sestra your
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 20 At My Friend’s: Geni!ve
118 / 600

m
sister (G tvoje sestre) owns the apartment:
OvoN je stanN tvoje sestreG. ‘This is an apartment of your sister’ (= your sister’s
apartment)
IvanN je u stanuDL tvoje sestreG. Ivan is in your sister’s apartment.
Observe how changing case of stan apartment doesn’t affect the words tvoje sestre
at all. Here I’ve put the matching Croatian and English possessive phrases in square
brackets:
IvanaN je sestraN [moje ženeG]. Ivana is [my wife]’s sister.
Čekam sestruA [moje ženeG]. I’m waiting for [my wife]’s sister.
Pišem porukuA sestriDL [moje ženeG]. I’m writing a message to [my wife]’s sister.
(Croatian has precise words for wife’s sister etc. but you can always use expressions
like these.)
There’s something interesting with street names. We have already encountered
Branimirova ulica, lit. Branimir’s street. However, the official name of the street is
Ulica kneza Branimira (knez is a title, roughly prince).
People are talking about the same street either as Branimirova – often leaving out
ulica – or as Ulica kneza Branimira, e.g. when writing their address, even business
address, some people prefer one form over another. If you’re not aware of the
grammar behind it – as foreigners often aren’t – you can get an impression these are
two different streets! Here I took a photo of a shop door and an official street sign
few meters away from it:
There’s one more issue: with possessives (e.g. Anin), you could say:
AutoN je AninN. The car ‘is Ana’s’. (= belongs to Ana)
You cannot do it when something belongs to someone expressed by more than one
word (e.g. moja sestra). There are two other ways.
The formal way is to use the verb pripadati belong (introduced in 16 Giving to
Someone, Going to Someone). You can use it with any expression that stands for
possessor. Keep in mind that this verb requires the DL case:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 20 At My Friend’s: Geni!ve
119 / 600

m
m
m
m
AutoN pripada mojoj sestriDL. The car belongs to my sister.
AutoN pripada AniDL. The car belongs to Ana.
Another universal way – but very colloquial – is to use the verb biti (je² +) be with the
preposition od¨ + G:
AutoN je od moje sestreG. (colloq.!) The car ‘is of my sister’.
AutoN je od AneG. (colloq.!) The car ‘is of Ana’.
• Something Possibly Interesting
In Croatian and Serbian grammatical traditions, the G case is always listed second,
after the nominative case. In some Serbian grammars, it’s even called ‘the second
case’. When the traditional N-G-... order of listing cases in primary school textbooks
in Croatia was changed to N-A-... – about a decade ago – a lot of Croatians
complained: they have learned the N-G... order in school, often memorizing it like a
song (and mostly not thinking what the cases really are, which is expected for 11-
year-olds).
The use of kod¨ + G for possession is kind of opposite of using DL (or possessive
adjectives), and it’s really a different kind of possession: kod¨ + G indicates really
having something (e.g. tickets in the pocket), while D indicates some intrinsic bond –
body parts, personal items, especially when “on” someone. Different kinds of
possession can be combined, as in tvoj auto je kod Ane – the car is yours, but Ana
has it (at the moment). In Russian, the first way – a preposition + G (Russian uses the
preposition u) – is the main way to indicate any kind of possession, including having
brothers. The Russian verb meaning have is rarely used.

21 Origins
We continue with uses of the genitive case (G), with more prepositions. There are
several prepositions that indicate origins, where something or someone comes or
came from – opposite to destinations.
The following two prepositions are opposites to u¨ + A and na¨ + A – they represent
origin of motion:
iz¨ + G from, off
(opposite to u¨ + A)
s¨ / sa¨ + G off of, from
(opposite to na¨ + A)
If you express going to a destination with u¨ + A, you should use iz¨ + G for a motion
in the opposite direction:
GoranN ide u školuA. Goran is going to school.
GoranN dolazi iz školeG. Goran is coming from school.
This preposition is often used to express someone’s origins:
JosipN je iz RijekeG. ‘Josip is from Rijeka.’ (i.e. born and raised there)
However, if you express a destination with na¨ + A, you must express the opposite
direction with s¨ / sa¨ + G:
Idem na posaoA. I’m going to work.
Idem s poslaG. I’m going from work.
Odlazimo na plažuA. We’re leaving for the beach.
Vraćamo se s plažeG. We’re coming back from the beach.
This preposition has 2 forms: the longer form is used before words starting with s-,
š-, z- or ž- (in colloquial Croatian, that rule is not always respected, you will hear and
read sa¨ before other words as well).
If you’re now scratching your head, guessing how to pronounce s posla, the s¨ is
normally pronounced with the following word, e.g. ‘sposla’, but always written
separately.
(German has also two ‘from’ prepositions – von and aus; however, they are not
really equivalent to Croatian ones; besides, they use the German Dative case.
Croatian uses the genitive case much more often than German.)
English has another possibility – the preposition off, expressing simply that you’re
not at some location. Croatian has no such preposition, you’ll have to use negation:
Nisam na posluDL. I’m off work.
There’s yet another preposition used in a very similar meaning:
od¨ + G from
It’s used if you’re going from someone, actually from a location that’s described
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 21 Origins
121 / 600

ići
with kod¨ + G:
AnaN odlazi od zubaraG. Ana is leaving the dentist’s office.
To ask where from something or someone goes/comes, just start a question with
one of these two words:
odakle / otkud(a) where... from
As usual, nothing else except this word is needed, no change of word order:
Odakle si? Where are you from?
— Iz RijekeG. From Rijeka.
Odakle dolazi ta bukaN? Where is that noise coming from?
— S plažeG. From the beach.
This table nicely summarizes three types of destinations, locations and origins, and
the various question-words:
u¨ + A
u sobuA
to the room
u¨ + DL
u sobiDL
in the room
iz¨ + G
iz sobeG
from the room
na¨ + A
na plažuA
to the beach
na¨ + DL
na plažiDL
at the beach
s¨ / sa¨ + G
s plažeG
from the beach
DL
zubaruDL

kod¨ + G
kod zubaraG
at dentist’s
od¨ + G
od zubaraG
from dentist’s
kamo...?
where... to?
gdje...?
where... ?
odakle...?
otkud(a)...?
where... from?
You will hear quite often kod¨ + G used colloquially ® for destinations as well
instead of just DL:
AnaN ide kod zubaraG. (colloq.) Ana going to the dentist’s.
There’s an often used adverb of space standing for a specific origin:
odavde from here
It’s always used to express that meaning, you cannot say "od ovdje".
Prepositions od¨ and do¨ are frequently used to indicate start and end points. They
are also used to indicate when something starts and when ends, that is, origin and
end in time:
Radim od osam do četiri. I work from 8 to 4.
With time adverbs, there are the following very often used combinations for time

odavno since a long time ago
odnedavno recently (since a recent moment)
You will sometimes see the first three spelled separately – od kada, od sada, od
tada – that’s not strictly standard in Croatian, but often used.®
The adverbs odavno and odnedavno have no exact English equivalents, but they
are easy to understand – something started either a long time ago or a short time
ago (of course, the ‘short time’ depends on the context).
The question-word otkad(a) has also no exact English equivalent: it’s used when we
want to ask when something ongoing has started (such questions are much more
precise than generic "how long", so Croatian prefers them):
Otkada GoranN spava? lit. ‘Since what time is Goran sleeping?’
— Od podnevaG. Since noon.
Here, we used the noun:
podne (podnev-) noon
It’s sometimes used as indeclinable, so you’ll hear also od podne.
There are matching time end points as well:
dokad(a) ‘until when’
dosad(a) until now
dotad(a) until then
donedavno until recently
(As for origins, the first three adverbs are sometimes spelled separately.) For
example:
Odavno ne jedem mesoA. I haven’t been eating meat ‘since long time ago’.
Dokad radiš? lit. ‘Until which time do you work?’
The adverb odavno points to a start point in time. The action or state might still be
ongoing: Croatian uses the present tense then.
The second sentence cannot be translated to English without rephrasing: it simply
asks for the end point in time for raditi work... Even the first sentence sounds
awkward for many English speakers – for a long time is preferred. Croatian,
however, has a single word meaning "from a distant moment in the past", so it’s
often used.
There’s another, very frequent use of the preposition od¨ – to indicate material
(understood broadly) something is made of. English uses nouns-as-adjectives
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 21 Origins
123 / 600

ići
jesti
ići
frequently for that purpose, but Croatian does not. For example:
OvoN je sokN od jabukeG. This is apple juice.
KućaN je od kamenaG. The house is of stone.
There are two more very useful words (they can be used on their own, but also with
nouns in G):
word
+ G
on its own
prije
before earlier
poslije
after
later
The word poslije is an exception from the usual pronunciation rules: many people
pronounce it pos-lje. Both words are very common:
Poslije plažeG idemo na večeruA. After the beach, we’re going to supper.
Jedem doručakA prije poslaG. I eat breakfast before work.
Instead of poslije, the word nakon can be used, but it’s always used with a noun in
G, while poslije can be used on its own:
Poslije idemo na večeruA. Later, we’re going to supper.
Note: these words don’t completely correspond to English before and after. I’ll
explain the details later, in 49 For 7 Hours: Definite Periods.
________
® Use of kod¨ + G for destinations is standard in Serbia and Bosnia. Spelling od sada,
as two words, is acceptable in Standard Serbian.
• Something Possibly Interesting
In Russian, which is a close cousin to Croatian, there’s basically the same three-way
table; of course, some prepositions have a bit different shape. Besides, the dative
case (D) is not equal to locative (L) in Russian – and the locative case is usually called
‘prepositional’:
kuda
where... to
gd’e
where
otkuda
where... from
v + A
v + L
iz + G
na + A
na + L
so + G
k + D
u + G

similar the system is. You can find more in this link: Motion and Location.

22 Here I am: More Pronouns
Let’s check now the pronouns in genitive (G) and dative/locative (DL). It’s less to
learn than it might seem, since the forms for the genitive case are identical to the
accusative forms, with one partial exception. And we’re going to learn pronouns in
plural. In all, 8 pronoun forms to learn.
Here are the personal pronouns for the 1st and 2nd persons in singular. Since forms
for the genitive and accusative cases are identical, I have grouped them to a single
column:
pronouns in singular
person
N
A, G
DL
1st
(ja) me²
mi²
2nd
(ti)
te²
ti²
The DL forms in singular have just a different end vowel.
I’ve put forms in the nominative case into parentheses to remind you that they
aren’t actually often used. In fact, they can be considered stressed forms – you use
them only if you want to emphasize the subject (or sometimes, you have to use
them, e.g. in constructions like ja sam Amerikanac I’m American).
Here are the forms for plural:
pronouns in plural
person
N
A, G
DL
1st
(mi) nas²
nam²
2nd
(vi)
vas²
vam²
Again, the DL forms have just a different final consonant.
Bear in mind that A, G and DL forms of pronouns must be placed in the second
position:
Pišem tiDL pismo. I’m writing a letter to you.
AnaN nasA čeka. Ana is waiting for us.
Now, you’re maybe scratching your head: how to distinguish e.g. ti (you, singular, N)
from ti² (the same pronoun, but in DL)? How to tell mi (we, N) from mi² (I, DL)? How
to understand this:
Ti mi pišeš. ???
Look at the verb. The verb is in the second person singular (-š) therefore ti is a
subject pronoun. Since there can be only one subject, mi must be in some other
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 22 Here I am: More Pronouns
126 / 600

slati | 2 | 3m/n
case, and the only other form is 1st person DL.
Another clue that ti in the sentence above cannot be anything else than N is its
place: if it would be in any other case, it would be in the second position. It’s not, so
it’s in N. The sentence means you’re writing to me.
Finally, here are the 3rd person forms. They are quite unlike forms for the 1st and
2nd person:
3rd person pronouns
gender
N
A, G
A
DL
f
ona
je²
ju²
joj²
n
(ono) ga²
mu²
m
on
f pl.
one
ih²
im²
n pl.
(ona)
m pl.
oni
You can see it’s again only feminine against everything else in G and DL, and in plural,
genders are not distinguished at all (except in N). While the 3rd person feminine A
was either je² or ju², in the genitive case, only je² is used.
Maybe you have noticed a small problem: what if someone uses two second-
position pronouns? I mean, something like this:
Šaljem tiDL gaA. I’m sending it to you.
In such sentences, the word order is always such that pronouns in DL come before
ones in the accusative or genitive case!
There’s one more fine point. You noticed that neuter pronouns are in brackets.
That’s because they are used not often: it’s much more common to use
demonstrative adjectives (i.e. ovo, to...) instead.
This is maybe a convenient place to introduce two very similar verbs:
razumjeti (razumije) understand ®
shvaćati understand ®
The first verb has inf like živjeti, but a special form in the present tense – there are
only few verbs like that.
They are usually used interchangeably, except when you don’t understand
something because of the bad phone line, you are not familiar with the word, or you
poorly know the language – you cannot use shvaćati then. Only razumjeti includes
recognizing of words and sounds, either spoken or written. (You’ll see later that
razumjeti behaves a bit specially in some aspects.)

razumjeti | 2

1
3m/n
f
For example:
Ne razumijem teA. I don’t understand you.
Ne shvaćam pitanjeA. I don’t understand the question.
In the second sentence, speaker really says I understand the words, but the whole
question doesn’t make sense to me. You could use razumjeti in the second sentence
as well – but shvaćati is more specific in this case.
The DL of personal pronouns is often used when you say thanks to someone:
Hvala tiDL. Thank you. (to someone you’re close with)
Hvala VamDL. Thank you. (to someone you’re not close with)
There are two special constructions which frequently use pronouns. Both use the
genitive case. The first one is:
evo + G here’s / here are
It’s used when you want to emphasize that something is now ‘here’, visible, e.g.
when you show up somewhere, or when you find something. The word starts a
sentence and it followed by a noun (with optional adjectives) or a pronoun in
genitive:
Evo moje sestreG. Here’s my sister!
The most common use is when you see someone or you come somewhere where
you’re expected. It’s used mainly in spoken language:
Evo meG. Here I am!
Evo gaG. Here he/it is!
Evo AneG. Here’s Ana!
It’s also used when you give something to someone, but it’s neither formal nor
polite, it’s used only when you are quite familiar to someone:
Evo pivaG. Here’s the beer!
(You will sometimes even hear eto + N in the last use, when giving something to
someone.) Similar words are eto and eno, used for more distant things, but they are
much less often used.
Another construction expresses there's no...; it uses negative pres-3 of imati have
with genitive:
nema + G there’s no
For example:
Nema pivaG. There’s no beer.
Nema soliG. There’s no salt.
This construction is much more versatile than the English one: like with evo, you can

use personal names, any nouns and pronouns, but they always have to be in G:
Nema AneG. lit. ‘There’s no Ana.’
Nema moje knjigeG. lit. ‘There’s no my book.’ = My book isn’t here.
Nema gaG. lit. ‘There’s no him.’ = He’s not here. (or it, depending on the
context)
Nema ihG. lit. ‘There’s no them.’ = They’re not here.
This is the negative existential construction. These sentences don’t say really here,
but there’s no way to translate them accurately to English (if you know, please tell
me). It always uses nema in the present tense (check the last sentence).
This construction is used in several frequent phrases. One of them is:
nema veze
  never mind
it doesn’t matter
The word veza normally means connection, so this is clearly a non-trivial meaning.
(This phrase can be also used within larger constructions that will be explained
later.)
How to distinguish two possible meanings of nema ga – there’s no him/it and he/she
doesn’t have him/it? The first meaning is impossible if there’s a subject. So, people
use on ga nema (or ona ga nema) to avoid confusion.
You cannot use the pronoun forms above with prepositions. If you want to use
prepositions with pronouns, you have to use the stressed forms, explained in 34 For
Them: Stressed Pronouns.
________
® “Ekavian” forms, which dominate in Serbia, apply to the verb razumjeti (razumije)
understand: its “Ekavian” form is razumeti, and the verb is fully regular.
Instead of shvaćati, a slightly different form of the verb, shvatati, is used in Serbia
and most of Bosnia.

The first two verses use grammar and words I’ve already explained. Almost each
verse starts with i kad, literally and when. The third verse translates literally as and
when you don’t have any makeup on your face: it uses G instead of A (i.e. šminke
instead of šminku) – it’s a way to express any, i.e. indefinite quantity. Such use will
be described in 45 Quantities and Existence.
Uvijek teA volim
Always I love you
    hoću da znaš
    I want you to know
Volim teA
I love you
    ne znam kako da odolim
    I’m unable to resist
U svakom slučajuDL teA volim
In any case, I love you
The construction hoću da znaš I want you to know uses a so-called desire clause.
Such things will be described in 56 Desires and Demands. (It uses the verb htjeti
want, which has irregular pres-1).
The part ne znam kako da odolim literally translates as I don’t know how to resist.
Such expressions will be also described later.
Check how in the verse u svakom slučaju te volim the word te² is actually the
fourth word – the first three words count as one, they form a closed phrase. The
word slučaj case is one of few nouns that can shift stress in DL – to the second
syllable from the end – when used with a preposition. The adjective svaki means
actually each, every, but often corresponds to English all or any.
Putting the word uvijek to the first place is emphasizing it.
The next verses contain the DL form mi²:
Volim teA uvijek
I always love you
I kada sanjaš
Even when you’re dreaming
Kad ne pišeš miDL
When you don’t write to me
Kad teG nema
When you’re not here
The word mi² is here in an unusual place (there’s a lot of liberty in poetry). In speech,
you will only hear kad mi ne pišeš.
Both kad and kada are used in this song for rhythmic reasons – there’s no difference
in meaning.
The last verse uses the negative existential construction, explained above.

23 I’m Cold: Basic Impressions
Croatian has a special way of expressing feelings and subjective opinions that’s quite
unlike how it’s done in English. However, if you know some German, this will all
likely be very familiar to you.
First, we can start with a general statement, such as:
Hladno je. It’s cold.
It’s a general statement, it’s simply cold. This statement is impersonal.
But what if someone (e.g. Ana) feels it’s cold? Croatian then adds one who feels
something into such sentences, but in the dative/locative case (DL):
AniDL je hladno. ‘It’s cold to Ana.’ = Ana is cold.
The one who feels it, the ‘experiencer’ (here: Ana, DL Ani) is usually put to the
beginning of the sentence, as above.
In such sentences, pronouns in DL are very often used, when you want to express
what you personally feel:
Hladno miDL je. ‘It’s cold to me.’ = I’m cold.
If you pay attention, you might have noticed that we again have two words trying to
get to the second position: mi² and je² (the pres-3 form of the verb biti). If
something like that happens, je² always comes after any pronouns.
Such words with fixed second-place position always come in a ‘block’ and cannot be
rearranged:
Često miDL je hladno. ‘It’s often cold to me.’ = I’m often cold.
Gramatically, the sentence is still impersonal: there’s no subject anywhere. The
‘experiencer’ is in the 1st person, but the verb is the 3rd person, singular. The verb
je² doesn’t change, regardless of who feels cold:
Hladno namDL je. ‘It’s cold to us.’ = We’re cold.
This use of impersonal je² with DL is frequently seen with the following adverbs:
bučno noisy
dosadno boring
hladno cold
lijepo nice
loše bad (see below)
toplo warm
vruće hot
zabavno entertaining
These words don’t adapt to the gender of subject. Actually, there’s no subject in
such sentences – they have quite different form in English and Croatian:
Dosadno miDL je. ‘It’s boring to me.’ = I’m bored.
If you would translate literally from English, you could say something completely
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 23 I’m Cold: Basic Impressions
132 / 600

1pl
1
ići
different:
Dosadan sam. I’m boring. (not how you feel!)
With the adverb loše, there’s a slightly shifted meaning when used with DL:
AniDL je loše. Ana is sick.
It’s interesting that German uses exactly the same construction: in sentences like
these, the pronoun mir is in the German Dative case, and the verb is in the 3rd
person:
Mir ist kalt.
Mir ist langweilig.
Mir ist schlecht.
 
  (German)
All three sentences translate word-for-word from Croatian, the only difference is
word order, which follows quite different rules in German.
You can freely use adverbs of intensity, including the prefix pre-:
Prevruće namDL je. It’s too hot ‘to us’. (= for us)
Jako miDL je dosadno. I’m very bored.
There's also a verb that means feel:
osjećati feel
When used just with an object in A, it means feel something, an object, or something
more abstract, e.g. pain. But when used with a se² and an adverb, it describes how
someone feels:
AnaN se osjeća odlično. Ana feels great.
Osjećam se grozno. I feel terrible.
This verb with se² is used only for internal states. You cannot say “osjećam se
bučno” if you’re in a loud environment, but you can say osjećam se loše if you don’t
feel well. Note that for some feelings, there is more than one way to express them:
Umoran sam. I’m tired.
Osjećam se umorno. I feel tired.
To ask how someone feels, use kako, but don’t forget se²:
Kako se osjećaš? How do you feel?
— Dobro. Alright. (‘Good.’)
There’s an interesting way to ask about ‘situation’:
Kako je? lit. ‘How is it?’
Kako ide? lit. ‘How is it going?’
Such questions mostly mean how are you (doing). However, if we add a place, then
we’re asking about a general information somewhere:

Kako je na posluDL? How is it going at work?
Kako ide na posluDL? (more or less the same meaning)
An answer can be a general description, what is done there, nothing necessarily
personal. But if we add a person in DL, the questions become specific, about
someone’s experience there:
Kako tiDL je na posluDL? How are you doing at work?
Kako ide AniDL na posluDL? How is Ana doing at work?
It seems to me there’s a subtle difference in these two questions: ones with ići (ide)
go are more specific about the work done, while ones with biti are a bit more about
everything, (e.g. co-workers, salary, etc.). The sentences are impersonal, verbs are
always in the 3rd person, singular, no matter what we add in DL (if anything):
Kako imDL ide na posluDL? How are they doing at work?
There are two often used expressions that cannot be used without someone in DL:
Drago miDL je. I’m glad.
Žao miDL je. I’m sorry.
Of course, instead of mi², other pronouns and nouns in DL can be used:
AniDL je žao. Ana is sorry.
The first expression is used when you are introduced to someone (like I’m glad to
meet you) and the second one is the usual way to express that you are sorry (when
something bad happens to someone else).
This construction with DL is used only for statements that can be either general or
subjective. For instance, you cannot say gladno mi je since there’s no statement
gladno je – hunger is not an objective, external situation (at least in Croatian
language).
However, it’s possible to take statements like these:
ObiteljN je važnaN. The family is important.
KnjigaN je dosadnaN. The book is boring.
MajicaN je lijepaN. The shirt is nice.
And convert them into personal opinions, using DL in the exactly same way:
ObiteljN miDL je važnaN. The family is important to me.
AniDL je knjiga dosadnaN. The book is boring ‘to Ana’. = Ana finds the book boring.
MajicaN miDL je lijepaN. (colloq.) The shirt is nice ‘to me’. = I find the shirt nice.
While English uses such expressions only with certain adjectives (e.g. important) in
Croatian, they are much more widely used, especially in the spoken language. (It’s
seen less often in formal writing, with adjectives like lijep beautiful, nice, such use of
DL is regarded as colloquial.) We again see that the Croatian DL case often
corresponds to English to + noun or pronoun.

nedostajati
Such expressions are often used to express what English expresses with favorite:
OvoN je omiljena knjigaN. ‘This a beloved book.’
OvoN miDL je omiljena knjigaN. This is my favorite book. (‘beloved to me’)
AniDL je ovoN omiljena pjesmaN. This is Ana’s favorite song.
The adjective omiljen doesn’t really mean favorite, it’s more beloved, popular,
preferred.
You can express the same using a possessive adjective, but it’s less common in
speech:
OvoN je Anina omiljena knjigaN. This is Ana’s favorite book.
Instead of the adjective omiljen, you’ll hear also these adjectives in this role:
najbolji best
najdraži most liked, most dear
For example:
OvoN miDL je najdraža pjesmaN. This is my most favorite song.
(The use of najbolji best in these expressions is quite colloquial. These two
adjectives, starting with naj-, are superlatives; they will be described in 63 Bigger and
Better: Comparatives.)
There are a couple of verbs that behave kind of similar to expressions above. The
most important one is:
trebati need/should
When used with the meaning need, it can be used simply as any verb that uses the
accusative case:
Trebam čašuA. (A) I need a glass.
However, it’s a bit more common to use this verb with what you need as the subject
(in N) and one who needs in DL:
Treba miDL čašaN. (N) (the same meaning!)
Observe how the verb in the second sentence is in the pres-3 form, since čaša glass
is its subject!®
Then, there are two verbs which express something or somebody is lacking or
missing:
nedostajati (nedostaje)
faliti (colloq.)
   lack/miss
The verb faliti is quite colloquial, but you’ll see it in fiction books. These verbs are
used with what is missing as the subject:
Jedan dioN nedostaje. A part is missing.

135 / 600

2 | nedostajati

Both are very often used with experiencers in DL, one who feels something is
missing, or is affected by it:
Jedan dioN tiDL nedostaje. You’re missing a part.
Nedostaje miDL IgorN. I miss Igor.
What or who is missing is always the subject, in N (which is usually not expressed, if
it’s a pronoun), which is completely unlike in English:
Nedostaješ miDL. I miss you. (you = one person)
Fališ miDL. (the same, but colloquial)
Nedostajete jojDL. She misses you. (you = group/formal to one
person)
Falite jojDL. (the same, but colloquial)
This is the same as in French, where the verb manquer also uses what is missed as
the subject. The same happens with the Italian verb mancare. In German, the verb
fehlen behaves in the same way:
(French)
Tu me manques.
(German) Du fehlst mir.
(Italian)
Mi manchi.
Nedostaješ mi. I miss you.
German here uses the Dative case (mir), which matches the Croatian grammar
exactly. However, in French and German, subject pronouns are mandatory, while
Italian is more like Croatian. The French verb manquer also covers meanings miss
the bus, miss the chance; the Croatian verb doesn’t.
Finally, there’s a way to express that there’s enough of something, or too little or
too much:
dosta je² + G there’s enough G
previše je² + G there’s too much G
premalo je² + G there’s too little G
This is used mainly with uncountable nouns (e.g. salt, sugar, coffee) and persons. For
example:
Previše je šećera u kavi. There’s too much sugar in the coffee.
Again, you can add who feels it in DL. The expression dosta je + DL usually translates
as had enough (of):
Ani je dosta kave. Ana had enough (of) coffee.
As in English, this also implies negative emotions:
AniDL je dosta DamiraG. Ana had enough of Damir.
Dosta miDL gaG je. I had enough of him.
Pay attention how words mi² (DL), ga² (G) and je² (a verb) are ordered in the second
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 23 I’m Cold: Basic Impressions
136 / 600

davati
prati
sentence – there’s only one possible order.
For countable nouns, the same expression will work, but you must use genitive plural
– the form I didn’t explain yet. (Such use of the genitive case is explained in a greater
detail in 45 Quantities and Existence; for the genitive plural, see 44 Genitive Plural.)
So far, we have seen three uses of the DL case (without prepositions, on its own).
One was a recipient of something (1), another was person who is somehow involved
in the action, usually because he or she is connected to the object (a body part, a
personal item, kin) (2), and this one is about personal impressions and feelings (3):
(1) AnaN daje šalicuA GoranuDL. Ana is giving a cup to Goran. ®
(2) AnaN pere GoranuDL kosuA. Ana is washing Goran’s hair.
(3) GoranuDL je hladno. Goran is cold.
As you can see, in all these uses, DL represents a person who is not causing
something to happen, but who is somehow affected while not being really an object.
(The object in (1) is a cup, and the object in (2) is the hair.)
______
® Using trebati with DL seems preferred in Standard Serbian.
Instead of šalica, in Serbia and Bosnia, šolja and šoljica are used for cup.

24 Past Tense
The past tense is completely different than the present tense in Croatian. First, it’s
always formed from two words, the past form of the verb and present of the verb
biti (je² +) be. The past form varies according to the gender of the subject and
whether it’s singular or plural.
The endings of the past form (also known as past participle, or l-participle) are not
too complicated:
gender
past
past pl.
fem.
-la
-le
neut.
-lo
-la
masc.
-o ®
-li
For example, here are the past forms the verb čitati read:
gender
past
past pl.
fem.
čitala
čitale
neut.
čitalo
čitala
masc.
čitao ®
čitali
(I have dropped the underline on the first vowel, since it’s only important for the
present tense anyway.)
Again, there’s no difference between the two masculine genders. Even better, the
past forms are simply created by adding their endings to a verb after the -ti is
removed. It works for many verbs with ‘irregular’ presents as well – their past is
perfectly regular. It holds even for the verb biti (je² +) be:
verb
past-f
past-m
biti (je² +) be
bila
bio
pisati (piše) write
pisala
pisao
piti (pije) drink
pila
pio
plesati (pleše) dance
plesala
plesao
slati (šalje) send
slala
slao
trčati (trči) run
trčala
trčao
Also, for almost all verbs, past forms are stressed on the same syllable as the
infinitive, e.g. izgledati → izgleda-la.
Past forms are similar to adjectives, and for few verbs, they can be used as true
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 24 Past Tense
138 / 600

3m/n
3m/n
3m/n
adjectives: then they get case endings, etc.
How to use it? Well, you take the right past form and the right form of the present
of biti (je² +) be (keeping in mind that it should go to the second position):
AnaN je plesala. Ana was dancing.
IvanN je čitao knjiguA. Ivan was reading a book.
You can use personal pronouns as subjects, but it’s common not to use them:
Spavali smo u hoteluDL. We were sleeping in a hotel.
There’s nothing special about the verb biti (je² +) be in the past – its past is formed
as for any other verb:
AnaN je bila gladnaN. Ana was hungry.
Even if you are talking in the 1st or 2nd person, you must respect the gender of the
subject (as with adjectives, the principle is identical):
Spavala sam. I was sleeping. (I = female)
Spavao sam. I was sleeping. (I = male)
Bila sam umornaN. I was tired. (I = female)
Bio sam umoranN. I was tired. (I = male)
Bili smo umorniN. We were tired. (we = males/mixed)
Since the past form indicates gender of the subject, even if pronouns are omitted in
the 3rd person, we know the subject gender:
Spavala je. She was sleeping.
Spavao je. He was sleeping.
If there are personal pronouns in A, G or DL that require the second position, of
course they somehow clash with forms of the verb biti (je² +) be that require the
same position. The rule is that present forms of the verb biti come first, except in
the 3rd person, where je² comes last in the chain of second-position contenders:
Čekao sam gaA. I was waiting for him. (I = male)
Čekala si gaA. You were waiting for him. (you = female)
Čekala gaA je. She was waiting for him.
If there’s a particle se², it behaves like other pronouns in A (me², ga², etc.). There’s a
special rule: if je² (pres-3 of biti) would come after se², it’s almost always left out:
Bojao sam se. I was afraid.
GoranN se je bojao. Goran was afraid.
GoranN se bojao. (this form is usually used)
The verb je² – when used to form the past tense – is sometimes left out in
newspaper headlines, on billboards, etc.
Don’t think about the past tense as čuo sam and like. Think about it as čuo +

sam², where the auxiliary verb goes to the second position, and the past form
can, in principle, be anywhere:
GoranN je jednog hladnog zimskog danaG čuo... On a cold winter day, Goran
heard...
(Expressions like jednog hladnog zimskog dana will be explained later.) When
you see an auxiliary verb, the matching past form (or an adjective) can be
sometimes far away!
You have to be careful with the impersonal use of verbs. That’s whenever English
uses “dummy” it, but also in impressions. From now on, I will mark all impersonal
verbs in the present tense with a small circle (°):
Hladno je°. It’s cold.
Hladno miDL je°. I’m cold. (lit. ‘It’s cold to me.’)
Drago namDL je°. We’re glad. (lit. ‘It’s dear to us.’)
Dosta muDL je°. He had enough.
All such sentences in the past tense always use neuter singular past forms:
Bilo je hladno. It was cold.
Bilo miDL je hladno. I was cold. (lit. ‘It was cold to me.’)
Bilo namDL je drago. We were glad. (lit. ‘It was dear to us.’)
Bilo muDL je dosta. He has had enough.
Now you see why I have marked impersonal verbs in present tense with a °: it
reminds you that you have to use the neuter singular in the past tense – a form that
ends in -o. Of course, this is just a reminder I’ve invented for this work, nobody else
uses it. Please don’t use it when you write Croatian words and sentences!
I repeat: impersonal sentences have no subjects. There have no nouns or
pronouns in the nominative case. The last sentence translates literally as ‘it was
enough to him’. They are always in neuter singular in the past tense. As there’s no
subject, the past form defaults to its neutral, kind of genderless form.
The following sentences at the first glance look impersonal too, but they aren’t:
PonoćN je. It’s midnight. (lit. ‘Midnight is.’)
JutroN je. It’s morning. (lit. ‘Morning is.’)
While English sentences are impersonal, Croatian ones aren’t: in these sentences,
subjects are ponoć f midnight and jutro morning, so in the past tense, past forms
will get gender of subjects:
Bila je ponoćN. It was midnight. (lit. ‘Midnight was.’)
Bilo je jutroN. It was morning. (lit. ‘Morning was.’)
Another likely unexpected behavior is for sentences of the form ovo je..., to je... +
noun. In such sentences, the subject isn’t to, but the noun, so the past tense adjusts
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 24 Past Tense
140 / 600

1pl
3pl
3pl
to its gender:
ToN je mačkaN. It’s a cat.
  → ToN je bila mačkaN. It was a cat.
ToN je problemN. That’s a problem.
  → ToN je bio problemN. That was a problem.
To negate sentences in the past tense, just use the negative forms of present tense
of biti (that is, nisam, nisi, nije, etc.):
AnaN nije bila gladnaN. Ana wasn’t hungry.
Nisam spavao. I wasn’t sleeping. (I = male)
Nije namDL bilo dosadno. We weren’t bored.
As usual, forms nisam and so on are not restricted to the second position and are
commonly found right before the past form.
A special case is the negative existential construction. While it uses impersonal
nema in the present tense, in the past tense, impersonal nije bilo is used:
Nema° pivaG. There’s no beer.
  → Nije bilo pivaG. There was no beer.
Nema° ihG. They aren’t here/there.
  → Nije ihG bilo. They weren’t here/there.
There are useful adverbs of time often used with verbs in the past tense:
davno a long time ago
jučer yesterday ®
malo prije moments ago
nedavno recently
nekad(a) some time ago
ranije earlier
The adverb nedavno means that some action or state happened at a recent period;
the adverb odnedavno means start something started at a recent moment (and
might still be ongoing).
For example:
IvanN je jučer bio u kinuDL. Ivan was at the cinema yesterday. ®
Sadly, some verbs are irregular even in the past tense; this includes all verbs having
infinitives ending in -ći and most with inf. in -sti. Therefore, when such verbs are
listed, they will have past-m forms listed as well after their pres-3:
jesti (jede, jeo) eat
plesti (plete, pleo) knit
(I will list the past-m and not e.g. past-f simply due to tradition of listing verb forms,
and because you will find past-m’s listed in printed and online dictionaries.) The
past-f is listed if it cannot be regularly obtained from the past-m; luckily, all other
past forms can always be deduced from the past-f. That’s how most verbs in -ći are
listed:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 24 Past Tense
141 / 600

3m/n
3pl
ići (ide, išao, išla) go
peći (peče, pekao, pekla) bake
vući (vuče, vukao, vukla) pull
Some verbs with infinitives in -sti have a bit specific past-f form as well:
gristi (grize, grizao, grizla) bite
rasti (raste, rastao, rasla) grow
Verbs like vidjeti see – actually, all verbs ending in -jeti, including razumjeti
understand – always have the following forms in the past: ®
inf
past-m
past-f
see
vidjeti
vidio
vidjela
understand
razumjeti razumio
razumjela
For instance:
Vidio sam Anu.A I saw Ana. (I = male)
Vidjela sam AnuA. I saw Ana. (I = female)
Razumio sam gaA. I understood him. (I = male)
Nismo ihA razumjeli. We didn’t understand them.
This is yet another instance where past forms are more regular then the present
tense. I will normally list the past forms for such verbs too, but sometimes I omit
them and write just ... to make the text more compact.
Once in a while, you’ll see and hear another past tense, the aorist tense ®. It’s most
common used in the first person, and its forms are just one word; for instance, the
1st person aorist form is usually obtained by replacing the infinitive -ti with -h, e.g.
vidjeh I saw. For a fuller description, see 99 Aorist Tense and Other Marginal
Features.
For a full discussion of various verb types, check A3 Verbs.
Finally, there are many verbs in Croatian which mean some action was brought to
completion. Such verbs are rarely used in the present tense, since present tense is
understood as ongoing, but they are frequent in the past tense. For example, the
verb pročitati means read completely. In the past tense, such verbs usually
correspond to simple English tenses, while normal verbs often correspond to
continuous tenses:
Čitao sam knjiguA. lit. ‘I was reading the book.’
Pročitao sam knjiguA. lit. ‘I’ve read the book completely.’
Such verbs – implying completion – are called perfective: they will be explained in
depth in 37 Complete Reading: Perfective Verbs and later chapters. You will
encounter some of them in examples in the following sections. For now, it’s enough

to keep in mind they aren’t normally used in the present tense.

® The endings for past forms listed above are Standard Croatian (and Serbian,
Bosnian, Montenegrin). In the colloquial use, many people pronounce past-m forms
that end in -ao (e.g. čekao, išao, and so on) with only -o (that is, čeko, išo, etc.). You
will hear such forms, and see them spelled sometimes with an apostrophe (i.e.
ček’o, iš’o).
In many regions, especially in smaller towns and villages, there are other forms of
past-m, e.g. ending in just -l; for more information, check A8 Dialects.
Instead of jučer, a slightly shortened juče is used in Serbia and Bosnia. Instead of
kino, the word for cinema used in Serbia and Bosnia is bioskop.
“Ekavian” forms, which dominate in Serbia, are much simpler for verbs in -jeti: from
e.g. videti, past forms are video, videla, from razumeti – razumeo, razumela, etc.
In parts of Croatia and Bosnia, you often hear (and sometimes read) generalized
“Ikavian” forms, where such verbs have all past endings in -i-, e.g. vidio, vidila, vidili,
etc.
The aorist tense is much more common in Bosnia and Serbia.
• Examples
Imala je lijepu rupicu na bradi She had a nice little hole on her chin is a popular song
from 1980’s performed by late Oliver Dragojević, a very popular Croatian pop
singer. Most songs he performed were in various “Ikavian” dialects, but this basically
standard.
Observe how the name of the song implies she from using the past-f form imala.
The song is basically all in the past tense. The first verse contains osobit particular
transformed into an adverb osobito particularly. The second verse contains druge,
which is the feminine plural form of drugi other, another, here used as a pronoun
(like other ones) but feminine, which cannot be exactly translated to English: it can
be understood as other women, other girls, basically other female ones (recall 18
This and That). Plural forms will be explained in the next chapter.
Nije bila osobito lijepaN
She wasn’t particularly beautiful
ali nije bila kao drugeN
but she wasn’t like other women
pa je ljubavN, kao uvijek slijepaN
so love, blind as always
zbog njeG razneA prelazila prugeA
crossed various tracks because of her
The third verse literally has ‘like always blind’. The fourth verse has razne pruge
various tracks split by the verb! This is not common in speech, but not
ungrammatical; it’s here for rhythmic reasons. You know the adjective refers to the
noun since they match in gender (feminine), number (plural) and case (A). The word
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 24 Past Tense
143 / 600

pruge means stripe, but also track (e.g. railroad). This verse has also zbog nje
because of her, where a stressed form of the pronoun is used. Stressed pronouns
will be explained in the following chapters.
In the chorus, the word rupica means small hole (while rupa is just hole): Croatian
has many words for small versions of things. They will be described in 85 Small and
Cute: Diminutives.
Imala je lijepu rupicuA na bradiDL
She had a nice little hole on her chin
znala je da grebe, znala je da gladi
she used to scratch, she used to stroke
imala je lijepu rupicuA na bradiDL
she had a nice little hole on her chin
drhtali smo složno, smeteniN i mladiN
we shivered in unison, confused and young
(Momčilo Popadić)
The phrase znala je da grebe is a bit ambiguous; it would be more common to say
znala je grebati, which is still ambiguous; the intended meaning is likely she used to
scratch; this will be explained in 32 Love and Like.

So far we have learned three cases (apart from the default, nominative case, where
there’s nothing to learn). All forms we have seen were in singular: we couldn’t say
I’m eating apples or birds are singing.
Let’s now see how nouns look in plural. We’ll start with the simplest possibility:
nominative and accusative plural for nouns ending in -a and for neuter nouns (that
is, more or less all nouns that end in -o or -e).
The rules are very simple:
jabuka apple → jabuke apples
pismo letter → pisma letters
more sea → mora seas
Couple of feminine and neuter nouns exist only in their plural forms; they will be
indicated with their gender and "pl.":
gaće f pl. underpants
hlače f pl. pants, trousers ®
naočale f pl. eyeglasses ®
novine f pl. newspaper(s)
škare f pl. scissors ®
traperice f pl. jeans ®
kliješta n pl. pliers
leđa n pl. back(s)
pluća n pl. lung(s)
vrata n pl. door(s)
usta n pl. mouth(s)
Some English nouns, including translations of the Croatian nouns listed above have
the same property – there are only scissors and pliers.
So we now know how to make the nominative form in plural, but what about the
accusative case? It turns out that for such nouns, the accusative plural is equal to
the nominative plural! So we can say:
Jedem jabukeA. I’m eating apples.
Pišem pismaA. I’m writing letters.
There are couple of neuter nouns that don’t have regular plurals; if you want to
express plural you will have to use something called mass noun that will be
explained a bit later. Often used nouns with such problem are:
dijete (djetet-) child
janje (janjet-) lamb
pile (pilet-) chick
štene (štenet-) puppy
Such nouns are easy to distinguish: they all get an additional t in their case-base.
Four frequently used neuter nouns shift their stress in plural forms:
ime (imen-) name → imena
jezero lake → jezera
rame (ramen-) shoulder → ramena
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 25 Plural
145 / 600

jesti
vrijeme (vremen-) time/weather → vremena
A few neuter nouns have alternative, more expressive and poetic, longer plural
forms in -esa; the most common is:
nebo sky → nebesa
Unfortunately, we still don’t know how to say birds are singing: we need to make
plural of the first Croatian verb form we have learned, pres-3. How to make it? The
rules are a bit more complicated than for other verb forms, it depends of the last
letter of the pres-3:
pres-3
pres-3pl
example
-a
-aju
pjevati sing → pjevaju
-i
-e
voziti drive → voze ®
-e
-u ®
jesti (jede) eat → jedu
It’s interesting that pres-3pl for any verb ends in either -u or -e. For example:
PticeN pjevaju. Birds are singing.
Many verbs that end in -a in pres-3 have – in the Standard scheme – the stress in the
pres-3pl on the same syllable as in the inf, regardless of stress in other present
forms. This is a rather small detail, and even if you’re trying to learn the Standard
stress, you might just ignore it.
If we want to express what more than one subject is doing (or their state) we can
link them with the following word:
i¨ and
For example:
AnaN i GoranN pjevaju. Ana and Goran are singing.
IvanN i DamirN jedu. Ivan and Damir are eating.
There’s a common way to express mutual action, corresponding to English each
other – just use se²:
AnaN i IvanN se vole. Ana and Ivan love each other.
As you can see, here se² is actually the fourth word, since the words Ana i Ivan are
treated as one ‘unit’.
This use explains farewells like vidimo se and čujemo se – they mean we see each
other (later, again) and so on. If you know a Scandinavian language, e.g. Swedish,
you’ll notice it has exactly the same construction:
(Swedish, Danish, Norwegian) Vi ses! = Vidimo se!
This literally translates as we see-s, where the appended -s means each other. A
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 25 Plural
146 / 600

difference is that Croatian uses a separate word se², and of course, Swedish, Danish
and Norwegian have (like English) mandatory pronouns with verbs.
We can also say (we use oni for an all-male or mixed group):
OniN se vole. They love each other.
There’s another way to express the mutuality, by a small phrase jedan drugog (all
male/mixed) or jedna drugu (all-female). Both literally mean one another:
AnaN i IvanN vole jedan drugog. Ana and Ivan love one another.
We would use the plural form one only for all-female groups.
This is maybe the right place to describe ‘impersonal plurals’ – like in the English
sentence they’re building a new road. This is exactly the same in Croatian, but you
have to leave the pronoun out:
Grade novu cestuA. They’re building a new road. (cannot add oni)
If you would add oni, it would then be a reference to some particular, known group
of people, e.g. when you see a group of workers and explain what they’re doing. In
the past, use masc. pl.:
Gradili su novu cestuA. They were building a new road.
What about expressing states and properties, like birds are beautiful? We must first
be able to put adjectives to plural as well, both to nominative and accusative! Since
adjectives always follow the noun pattern, accusative will be equal to nom. (we can
list both together as NA-pl). Even better, for feminine and neuter adjectives, endings
will actually be the same as for nouns:
gender
adj. NA-pl
example
fem.
-e
velike ribe
big fishes
neut.
-a
velika jezera
big lakes
Then, we need the pres-3pl form of the verb to be:
biti (je² +) be → su²
So now we can say:
PticeN su lijepeN. Birds are beautiful.
PismaN su dugaN. The letters are long.
And we are able to say:
ToN su pticeN. These are birds. (lit. ‘birds are that.’)
Pay attention that in demonstrative sentences, to stays in singular, unlike in English.

There are few verbs – otherwise irregular – that have a bit irregular pres-3pl as well.
They end in -ći in infinitive, have pres-3 in -če, but the pres-3pl in -ku. Common ones
are:
peći (peče) bake → peku
teći (teče) flow → teku
tući (tuče) beat, smack → tuku
vući (vuče) pull → vuku
If a verb has pres-3 in -če, but its infinitive ends in -ti, there’s no such complication:
the pres-3pl is completely regular:
vikati (viče) yell → viču
What about feminine nouns in a consonant? It’s quite simple – they just get an -i in
their N-pl, and the accusative is the same as nominative:
NoćiN su dugeN. Nights are long.
Now, there’s a small problem. Croatian has usually specific words for male and
female people/animals – pairs like prijatelj friend (m) and prijateljica friend (f).
How do you call a group of friends, if some of them are male, some female?
Croatian has then a notion of default gender. For most terms, the default gender is
masculine. You simply use the masculine noun in plural, but the meaning is rather
generic or mixed.
However, for some animals, the default gender is feminine. Such animals are:
feminine
masculine
cow
krava
bik bull
vol ox
fox
lisica
lisac (lisc-)
cat
mačka
mačak (mačk-)
duck
patka
patak (patk-)
(There are more.) So, if you see a bunch of cats, either of mixed sex, or you don’t
know their sex, you simply refer to them as if all were feminine.
Let’s summarize changes of feminine (and all nouns that end in -a) and neuter nouns
in plural:
noun type (N)
NA-pl
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -e
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) -o or -e → -a

® In Serbia, and often in Bosnia, the following nouns are used instead of the nouns
listed above (forms used there are given after arrows); they have plural forms only
as well:
hlače → pantalone
naočale → naočare / naočari
škare → makaze
traperice → farmerke
In Dalmatia, you’ll sometimes hear and read -u in all verbs, for example from trčati
(trči) run, pres-3 is trču; this not standard.
In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, which completely dominates in Serbia, there’s a
small group of verbs which have another pattern. The most common is razumeti
understand: its pres-3 is regular, but pres-3pl has a specific pattern:
pres-3 razume → pres-3pl razumeju
You can think about them in this way: verbs which change -e to -u in pres-3pl also
change vowel from inf to pres-3; they are all kind of ‘irregular’. However, the
“Ekavian” verb razumeti is completely regular, as e.g. čitati read which gets -ju in
pres-3pl, it just has a different vowel before it.
In the “Ikavian” pronunciation (which is used colloquially in parts of Croatian coast,
including Split), such verbs behave usually like other verbs in -iti (i.e. the verb is
razumiti).
• Something Possibly Interesting
The rules above apply to all nouns. English sometimes borrows plural forms along
singular forms, so some people use e.g. singular bacterium vs. plural bacteria. Not so
in Croatian: the singular is bakterija and the plural is only the expected form
bakterije.
• Examples
Mirno teku rijeke Rivers flow peacefully is a song from 1959. It starts with simple,
but poetic verses:
Mirno teku rijekeN
Rivers flow peacefully
mirno žitaN šume
wheat hisses peacefully
svjetloN njiše misliA
the light sways thoughts
misliN njišu šumeA
thoughts sway forests
The verb teći (teče, tekao, tekla) flow is one of few verbs having pres-3 in -ku,
already mentioned above. The verb šumiti means boom, but the English likes hiss

prštati
taknuti
with sounds of grain and tall grass. Using žito corn, grain in plural is unusual: it’s here
forced to make the corresponding verb plural, so it can rhyme with the plural of
šuma forest.
The noun misao (misl-) f thought is one of feminine nouns not ending in -a, and
maybe the only one ending in -o. Note the verb misliti think is clearly related to this
noun. The verb njihati (njiše) means rock, sway.
In the last verse, both nouns (misli and šume) could be in either N or A – these forms
coincide in plural. So it falls back to the word order (the same as in English) to
understand what sways what.
The following verses have some weird features which are rare in speech. The form
ptica is genitive plural – it looks the same as N in writing for this noun – a case which
will be introduced later: normally, it would be let ptica flight of birds, but the word
order noun-noun-in-G is inverted here, which is almost never done in speech and
normal writing:
PticaG letN šara svodA
Flight of birds scrawls the vault
pršti pjevN u jasni vedri danA
singing frizzles on a bright clear day
jasni danN, vedri smijehN
clear day, cheerful laughter
vedar čovjekN nikad nije samN
a cheerful man is never alone
The verbs šarati scribble, scrawl and prštati (pršti) sputter; fizzle, sizzle are not really
common. The construction u jasni vedri dan uses u¨ + A because it’s about time
(recall u srijedu etc.). The adjective jasan (jasn-) is precisely clear (and then
obvious), while vedar (vedr-) means without clouds (and then cheerful), but this word
play is impossible to translate to English.
The following verses start with maštom – it’s the word mašta imagination in a case
which is yet not introduced (the instrumental case):
MaštomI takneš
With imagination, you touch
  svaku travkuA, cvijetA
  each blade of grass, each flower
tu si velikN tiN, i tvojN je svijetN

26 Yes or No?
The simplest questions are those where one just answers with a yes or no. Such
short answers are, by the way, acceptable in Croatian. In the Standard Croatian, the
recipe for such simple questions is quite simple: move the verb to the beginning, if it
isn’t already there, and then insert a particle li² to the second position (before all
other second-position words):
Ideš u školuA. You’re going to school.
Ideš li u školuA? Are you going to the school?
— Da. Yes. / — Idem. I’m going.
— Ne. No. / — Ne idem. I’m not going.
If the verb in a sentence is present form of the verb biti be (that is, je², sam², etc.)
the verb cannot be simply put to the beginning, since it must be in the second
position!
Therefore, there are extended (or stressed) forms of the present of the verb biti (je²
+), used when the verb must be the first word in a sentence. The forms are:
pers.
sing.
plur.
1st
jesam
jesmo
2nd
jesi
jeste
3rd
je
jesu
They are quite simple: just add je- to the beginning of usual forms, and you have the
forms you need! Again, je² is an exception – it looks exactly the same in its normal
and extended form. We can then ask:
GladniN ste. You’re hungry. (to a group/someone you respect)
Jeste li gladniN? Are you hungry?
— Da. Yes. / — Jesmo. We are.
— Ne. No. / — Nismo. We aren’t.
Je li žednaN? Is she thirsty?
— Da. Yes. / — Je. She is. ®
— Ne. No. / — Nije. She isn’t.
— Možda. Maybe.
— Ne znam. I don’t know.
As you can see, you can answer with either da or ne or with the verb in its extended
form. There are no special extended/stressed negative forms – the usual negative
forms of biti (je² +) are already stressed.
Note also how she is implied by the feminine form of the adjective (žedna).
Now for the past tense. The past tense is made from two words, but for purpose of
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 26 Yes or No?
152 / 600

ići
ići
making questions, the auxiliary verb – the present tense of biti (je² +) be – is the
important word. Grammatically, the past form behaves like a kind of adjective and
has no role in making questions. Therefore, we need to move the auxiliary (je², sam²,
and so on):
Gledala si filmA. You watched the movie. (to a female)
Jesi li gledala filmA? Did you watch the movie?
— Da. Yes. / — Jesam. I did.
— Ne. No. / — Nisam. I didn’t.
If je² is left out due to se², it must reappear in questions:
Bojao se. He was afraid.
Je li se bojao? Was he afraid?
Everything described so far was in the Standard Croatian. Colloquially, you will also
hear and often read other ways of making such questions. The first one, and quite
common, is to just put da li to the front, nothing else is changed, no verbs are
moved, the present forms of biti (je² +) don’t get extended, etc:
Da li ideš u školuA? (colloq.) Are you going to the school?
Da li ste gladniN? (colloq.) Are you hungry?
Da li si gledala filmA? (colloq.) Did you watch the movie?
Da li se bojao? (colloq.) Was he afraid?
I used the abbreviation (colloq.) to remind you that these are colloquial sentences in
Croatian ®. It’s very often seen and heard, e.g. on the wall in a (fancy) bakery:
This translates as Have you ever tasted a fresher sandwich? – the word kad, in
yes/no questions, can mean ever as well (this will be explained in more detail in 41
Somewhere, Nobody, Everything...).
You will sometimes hear and read questions with these two words contracted to
dal, or spelled together as dali.
Another option is to use the standard way, but without li:
Jesi gledala filmA? (colloq.) Did you watch the movie?
Yet another quite colloquial option is to put je li to the front, frequently contracted
to just jel (also spelled as je l, je l’):
Jel ideš u školuA? (colloq.) Are you going to the school?
Jel ste gladniN? (colloq.) Are you hungry?
Jel si gledala filmA? (colloq.) Did you watch the movie?
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 26 Yes or No?
153 / 600

ići
Jel se bojao? (colloq.) Was he afraid?
Also, colloquially, it’s possible to turn normal sentences into a question just by
changing their intonation – sentences end on a higher tone, and are spoken faster –
no rearrangement of any kind is needed:
Ideš u školuA? (colloq.)
Gledala si filmA? (colloq.)
Bojao se? (colloq.)
However, with just the present forms of biti (je² +), there are questions like this
often heard:
Jeste gladniN? (colloq.)
All the ways of making questions described above are used in real life, unlike some
formal terms that actually nobody uses (e.g. formal hladnjak vs. colloq. frižider
fridge). For example, here are some statistics (by Google™ search) from the
Croatian discussion site, forum.hr:
form
  hits
jesi li gledala
3280
da li si gledala
1420
jesi gledala
11800
There’s another, special type of questions, asking for advice or an opinion. In English,
such questions begin with Should I... or something like it. In Standard Croatian, you
can start such questions with da li da + present, but that works for the present tense
only:
Da li da gledam taj filmA? Should I watch that movie?
In the past tense, you have to use the verb trebati need/should + verb in infinitive;
questions follow the same pattern as any other yes/no question:
Jesam li trebala gledati taj filmA? Should I have watched that movie?
(How to use infinitives will be explained a bit later.)
Colloquially, da li is very often left out in such opinion questions, and you’ll most of
the time hear and see just:
Da gledam taj filmA? (colloq.) Should I watch that movie?
Sometimes you’ll hear jel instead of da li even in opinion questions:
Jel da gledam taj filmA? (colloq.) Should I watch that movie?
Such opinion questions are often answered with conditionals and imperatives – verb
forms I haven’t introduced yet. (For conditionals, check as 39 Would, Could:
Conditionals; for imperatives, see 53 Giving Orders.)

® In Serbia and parts of Bosnia, affirmative answers using the verb biti (je² +) be in
the 3rd person can be also jeste (besides je). However, this additional stressed form
is not used when forming questions – it’s used only in answers and sometimes in
regular sentences, meaning roughly is really.
The way of making questions using da li... is considered standard in Bosnia and
Serbia, and it’s often considered (or was often considered) standard in Croatia as
well.
• Something Possibly Interesting
Most languages in Europe usually use short responses meaning yes and no; English
and Celtic languages are unique in preferring short answers with generic verbs (e.g. I
do, I am.)
Some people in Croatia hate other people using questions (and other constructions
derived from questions) starting with da li..., for reasons they are often unable to
explain (they usually claim it’s “not Croatian”). However, such constructions are very
common in speech.
• Examples
This song from 1970’s, Piši mi by Drugi način – still quite popular – nicely illustrates
various ways to ask yes/no questions: each verse uses another form! (It also uses a
couple of constructions and forms I haven’t explained yet; the proposition pored
beside requires the genitive case.)
I dal još svirate
And do you still play
  noću pored rijekeG
  at night by the river
Sad je došlo lijepo vrijemeN
Now nice weather has come
Pjevate li
Do you sing
  one naše pjesmeA
  those songs of ours
Da li ponekad
Do you sometimes
  sretneš moju draguA
  come across my darling
Jel još uvijek onako lijepaN
Is she still so beautiful
Pita li za meneA
Does she ask about me
  i dal meA čeka
  and is she waiting for me
(Fikret Kurtović)
You can listen to it on YouTube™.
Note how there’s no ona she in the verse Jel još uvijek onako lijepa, but the
adjective lijepa is in the fem. N sing., and that’s enough: we know who he’s talking
about. We again see the form još uvijek.

27 Body
Croatian sees body parts and what’s felt in them in a quite different way than
English. Let’s check words for body parts first:
glava head
jezik tongue
koljeno knee
kost f bone
lakat (lakt-) elbow
leđa n pl. back
noga leg/foot
nos nose
peta heel
prst finger, toe
rame (ramen-) shoulder
ruka hand/arm
trbuh stomach (belly) ®
usta n pl. mouth
vrat neck
zub tooth
Words leđa and usta we have already encountered: they exist only in plural. Both
words are neuter. The noun rame belongs to a small group of neuter nouns with
case-base extended with an n.
The word jezik tongue means also language.
It’s interesting that Croatian doesn’t distinguish arm from hand or leg from foot!
There’s only one word for both arm and hand.
Now, there are two very useful and often used verbs:
boljeti (boli,...) hurt
svrbiti / svrbjeti itch
The verb boljeti has past forms like živjeti and other verbs on -jeti, so I have omitted
them, and wrote only periods. The verb svrbiti has another infinitive form, svrbjeti –
it’s more formal – but the present forms are the same; for more, see 58 Colloquial
and Formal.
Now, the English verb itch can be used in two ways:
My leg itches.
The shirt itches me.
Both Croatian verbs are always used in the second way. Something (a body part,
shirt...) always does something (itches, ‘hurts’) to someone. In Croatian, the first
sentence translates as:
Svrbi meA nogaN. ‘The leg is itching me.’ = My leg itches.
One who gets affected is in accusative, and the body part or anything else that
causes feelings is the subject of the sentence, and therefore in nominative. What is
the source of feelings is often put to the end.
This, a bit unexpected use of cases, is sometimes called inverse assignment. What
you expect to be a subject actually isn’t, at least grammatically.

If you use personal pronouns, they of course must be at the second place, but if you
use general nouns or names, they are usually put to the first place. They must be in
accusative, since they are really objects: legs, shirts, etc. are itching them:
AnuA svrbi nogaN. ‘The leg is itching Ana.’ = Ana’s leg itches.
Such placement is common in Croatian: if you express someone’s feelings or
experience, it’s normal to put him or her to the front, regardless of case. Recall this
example:
AniDL je bilo dosadno. (DL) Ana was bored.
Pain is expressed in exactly the same way:
Boli meA zubN. ‘The tooth is hurting me.’ = My tooth hurts.
Note how in both sentences, the subject (a body part, here noga, zub) comes after
the verb. This is the default word order in such sentences; you can tweak it to
emphasize the body part by putting it first.
You must bear in mind that leđa and usta are always in plural, despite everyone
having just one. Since they are subjects, verbs must be put into plural as well:
LeđaN meA bole. ‘The backs are hurting me.’ = My back hurts.
UstaN meA svrbe. ‘The mouths are itching me.’ = My mouth itches.
We haven’t learned plural of masculine nouns yet, but for both prst and zub, it’s
simply made by adding an -i:
GoranaA bole zubiN. Goran’s teeth hurt.
All sentences above were in the present tense. Examples for the past tense (keep in
mind that the body part is the subject in such sentences):
AnuA je svrbila nogaN. Ana’s leg itched.
LeđaN su meA boljela. My back has hurt.
GoranaA su boljeli zubiN. Goran’s teeth have hurt.
There are two more body parts, and both are quite special: their plural form is not
only irregular, it’s in different gender:
noun
plural noun
oko eye
oči f pl.
uho ear
uši f pl.
For example:
AnuA boli okoN. Ana’s eye hurts.
AnuA bole očiN. Ana’s eyes hurt.
The gender switch is visible in the past tense:

prati
2
AnuA je boljelo okoN. Ana’s eye has hurt.
AnuA su boljele očiN. Ana’s eyes have hurt.
If you can’t (or don’t want to) tell what hurts, you should make an impersonal
sentence, i.e. without a subject – and consequently, neuter singular in the past tense
– but don’t forget the object:
Boli° meA. It hurts.
Boljelo meA je. It has hurt.
The next interesting thing is what grows from the body – hair. While English has only
one word, Croatian strictly distinguishes these two terms:
kosa human hair growing from the scalp ®
dlaka facial hair, body hair, animal hair
The word kosa is used in singular only – it stands for any amount of hair. Such nouns
are called mass nouns. Similarly, English hair can refer to a single hair or any amount
of it. The word is reserved for human hair growing from the top of the head.
Everything else is dlaka, which can be used in either in singular or in the plural dlake
to describe any amount of such hair. It’s interesting that French has the same
distinction: cheveu vs. poil – but they both refer to single hair, you have to use plural
in most circumstances. Italian does it too: capello vs. pelo.
When talking about body parts, it’s common to express possession somehow. Recall
it’s normal, when you use body parts as objects, to express possession by DL:
AnaN pere GoranuDL kosuA. Ana is washing Goran’s hair.
The DL case is also used, usually in speech, to express possession of a described
body part as well, that is, when a body part is the subject of the verb biti (je² +) be.
We start from these sentences:
KosaN je čistaN. The hair is clean.
NogeN su prljaveN. The feet are dirty.
LiceN je prljavoN. The face is dirty.
Here the nouns kosa hair, noga leg/foot (in plural noge) and lice face are the
subjects. Then we add the person in DL, and change the word order a bit, as usual
(but the body parts are still subjects):
(1) GoranuDL je kosaN čistaN. Goran’s hair is clean.
GoranuDL su nogeN prljaveN. Goran’s feet are dirty.
LiceN tiDL je prljavoN. Your face is dirty.
We can shuffle words around, e.g. ... čista kosa and so on.
There’s another way: you can usually express possession with the verb imati have.
Now the body parts and any adjectives describing them are in A:
(2) GoranN ima čistu kosuA. Goran has clean hair.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 27 Body
159 / 600

2
2
GoranN ima prljave nogeA. Goran has dirty feet.
Imaš prljavo liceA. You have dirty face.
There’s something very interesting. The way #1 to describe a body part – using DL
for possession of it – is limited to temporary properties. Using it to express more
permanent properties (e.g. color) is very rare.
The same holds for clothes. If a T-shirt is dirty – and especially if someone is wearing
it – you can say:
MajicaN tiDL je prljavaN. Your T-shirt is dirty. (The T-shirt you’re wearing)
PrljavaN tiDL je majicaN. (the same meaning, emphasis on prljav dirty)
But nobody would use that expression to express that the shirt is red, as this is a
permanent property.
Of course, there’s yet another way to express possession: with possessive
adjectives, like Goranov or moj my. It can be used for both kinds of properties.
However, it’s much less often used in speech, the two ways above are preferred.
Frequency of these expressions is not the same in all regions: the first way is less
common in western and northern Croatia, the verb imati have is preferred in wider
Zagreb and Rijeka regions, especially in small towns and villages. Using DL in such
sentences gets more common further you go to the southeast. This table sums up
the three possibilities (using the 1st person):
Ways to say my hair is dirty
is it common?
KosaN miDL je prljavaN. 
PrljavaN miDL je kosaN.
DL
yes (for temporary prop.)
Imam prljavu kosuA.
verb have
yes (esp. western areas)
Moja kosaN je prljavaN.
possessive
not really
There’s another way to look at this feature. Temporary properties – wet, dirty, clean
etc. affect the person. It’s something he or she maybe doesn’t know. Everyone
knows he or she has a long or brown hair, or a red shirt. This is yet another example
where DL = the affected person. Therefore, the form with the DL is not used to
express that something is new.
I admit – this is a rather fine point. If you are going to use possessive adjectives or
the verb imati in all circumstances, you will still be understood, of course, and not
sound weird. Just be prepared to hear such expressions from native speakers.

specially in smaller towns and villages – lasi f pl. used colloquially instead of kosa.
• Something Possibly Interesting
A reader has pointed out that Croatian has specific words for hand and foot: šaka
and stopalo. However, these words are limited to very narrow contexts, e.g. when
you describe where a muscle or a tendon is, or you speak about an injury or surgery.
The word šaka is also used (mainly in sport, but also when talking about physical
fights) where English uses fist.
When we talk about washing, holding, raising, busy, dirty, clean hands, only ruka can
be used.
Many languages consistently distinguish arm vs hand, but many other languages, like
Croatian, don’t. This map in The World Atlas of Language Structures nicely illustrates
the diversity of languages regarding this feature: Hand and Arm.
• Examples
Krunoslav Slabinac, usually known under the nickname Kićo, performs – with a
traditional band Slavonske lole – a traditional song Crne oči Black eyes. The song is
from Šokadija, a part of Slavonia, a historical region of Croatia, where Šokci live.
They speak a specific, a bit archaic dialect, which is only partially featured in this
song. It’s mostly “Ikavian”, i.e. there’s i in many places where standard Croatian has
ije or je:
Crne očiN dobro vide
Black eyes see well
Di u mrakuDL dvojeN side
Where two people are sitting in the dark
 
JednoN drugomDL progovara
One starts speaking to another
Di je naša ljubav staraN
Where is our old love
(traditional; author unknown)
The song starts with an easy to understand line. The next line has di for where,
which is not just “Ikavian”, but used colloquially in many parts of Croatia. Another
“Ikavian” form in that line is side instead of sjede they sit.
Each pair of lines is sung twice. The last line has the adjective stara after the noun,
which is common in traditional songs (but note the adjective naša, before the same
noun).
You can listen to it on YouTube™. Note that the stress is not standard in this song
(the present tense is progovara) – it’s more similar to the ‘western’ stress.

28 Asking Who and What
Let’s learn how to make simple questions like who is driving? or what do you read?
I’ve explained some simple questions already, but this will explain it deeper.
English has two question words (who and what). Croatian has essentially the same
two words, however they change in cases. Here are forms for the Croatian
equivalent of who:
people
(who)
N
A, G
DL
tko
kog(a) kom(e)
The final a in koga and e in kome can be dropped, but the longer versions are used
quite often. Colloquially, especially in certain regions, tko is simplified to just ko .®
The question-words are placed to the first position and must be put into the exact
case, for instance:
IvanN je vozio. Ivan was driving (Ivan N)
TkoN je vozio? Who was driving?
For the accusative case (contrasted with the question about the subject in N):
GoranN čeka AnuA. Goran is waiting for Ana. (Anu A)
KogaA GoranN čeka? Who is Goran waiting for? (A)
TkoN čeka AnuA? Who is waiting for Ana? (N)
English questions could also be written with whom (whom is Goran... ) – that’s
recommended by many use guides, but increasingly rare in real life. You could think
about whom as an almost extinct object case form of who, corresponding to
Croatian A and DL.
Examples for the DL case:
AnaN je pisala IvanuDL. Ana was writing to Ivan. (Ivanu = DL)
KomeDL je AnaN pisala? Who was Ana writing to?
KnjigaN pripada AniDL. The book belongs to Ana. (Ani = DL)
KomeDL pripada knjigaN? Who does the book belong to?
There’s no special placement of verbs or any other words in Croatian questions,
except that the question word must be at the first position.
If you are asking about something that’s obviously not a person, you would use
another question word (I’ve already introduced its nominative form):
things
(what)
N, A
DL
G
što
čemu
čega
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 28 Asking Who and What
163 / 600

bojati se
bojati se
bojati se
As said before, in many regions, šta is used colloquially instead of što.®
Pay attention how with tko, A = G, while što has A = N (as with neuter nouns and
adjectives in neuter gender!)
AnaN je pisala pismoA. Ana was writing a letter. (pismo = A)
ŠtoA je AnaN pisala? What was Ana writing? (što = A)
IvanN se boji mrakaG. Ivan is afraid of dark. (mraka = G)
ČegaG se boji IvanN? What is Ivan afraid of? (čega = G)
When answering such questions, you can answer with just one word, but in the right
case:
KomeDL je AnaN pisala? Who was Ana writing to?
— IvanuDL. To Ivan. (DL)
ŠtoA je AnaN pisala? What was Ana writing?
— PismoA. A letter. (A)
KogaA GoranN čeka? Who is Goran waiting for?
— AnuA. Ana. (A)
ČegaG se boji IvanN? What is Ivan afraid of?
— MrakaG. Dark. (G)
It’s possible to ask questions about any "slot" in a sentence, normally occupied by a
noun, including one after prepositions. Then the preposition will be before the
question word (like in a kind of ultra-formal English):
Bili smo kod AneG. We were at Ana’s house/home. (kod¨ + G)
Kod kogaG smo bili?
— Kod AneG. At Ana’s house/home.
Now, you have to answer with the right preposition and the noun in the right case!
Since tko and što can be used as subjects in questions, what forms of verbs and
other words do we have to use with them? It turns out to be quite simple and like in
English (and unlike in Spanish, where quiénes is used to ask about plural):
tko = masculine sing., 3rd person
što = neuter sing., 3rd person
Therefore, even if you are asking about someone who is obviously female, or if the
answer is obviously more than one person, you should always set up the question in
the masculine gender, singular:
TkoN je bio ovdje? Who was here?
TkoN je gladanN? Who is hungry?
For things:
ŠtoN je to bilo? What was that?
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 28 Asking Who and What
164 / 600

2
That’s very similar to English, where you ask in singular even if it’s obvious the
answer will be more than one person.
Another example: to ask about which body part hurts, you have to use što as the
subject, since body parts are subjects in such sentences, while the person feeling the
pain is grammatically the object (in A). Consequently, in questions, past forms must
be neuter singular, and in answers the body part is in N:
ŠtoN teA boli? lit. ‘What hurts you?’ = Where does it hurt you?
— ZubN. A tooth.
ŠtoN je boljelo AnuA? lit. ‘What did hurt Ana?’ = Where did it hurt Ana?
— RukaN. Hand/arm.
The word što is a pronoun, it cannot be attached to a noun. You cannot use it to ask
e.g. What movie are you watching?. For such purposes, Croatian uses another word,
adjective koji, explained in 57 Whose, What Thing and What Like.
The question-word što is used to ask for additional information about what
someone is, e.g. what profession:
ŠtoN je IvanN? What is Ivan?
— LiječnikN. Doctor.
What about animals? For general animals, you should use što, but for animals you’re
familiar with (e.g. pets) tko is often used.
Recall that što is used for generic questions where we know the subject, but not the
verb:
(AnaN spava. Ana is sleeping.)
ŠtoA AnaN radi? What is Ana doing? (lit. ‘working’)
— Spava. She’s sleeping.
For general questions what is/was going on – nothing is known – the following two
verbs are used (the first one is a bit colloquial)®:
dešavati («) se² 
događati («) se²  
   go on, happen
For example:
ŠtoN se događa ovdje? What is going on here?
Since Croatian has only one present tense, it’s very common to add the all-purpose
demonstrative to that after question words, usually before the verb, to stress that
you’re asking something present, ongoing right now, what or who can be seen:
ŠtoA to AnaN radi? What is Ana doing? (right now)
ŠtoA to radiš? What are you doing?
ŠtaA to radiš? (the same meaning, but colloquial) ®

pisati
pisati
ŠtoN se to događa? What is going on? (right now)
TkoN je toN? Who’s that?
KomeDL to pišeš? Who are you writing to? (I see you’re typing a message)
Observe that between the question words and to second-position words may
appear. This removes the ambiguity of the present tense, as this question is also
about someone’s job, depending on the context:
ŠtoA radiš? What are you doing? / What do you do?
Such to is optional, of course, but makes the question really specific. Even adding
sad(a) now wouldn’t remove the ambiguity, since sad(a) can stretch to days, weeks,
months – depending on the context.
If you are puzzled what to is in such questions, it behaves rather as an adverb or
particle, and never changes its form.
Finally, it’s possible to ask questions what should be, or what should you do, that is,
ask for advice or an opinion. There’s a special construction where da is put right
after the question-word:
ŠtoA da pišem? What should I write?
KogaA da čekamo? Who should we wait for?
ŠtoA da radim? What should I do?
(Google™ for što da radim or šta da radim and you’ll see it’s a very frequent
expression.)
The main verb should be in the present tense, as in other questions of this type (gdje
da..., kada da... etc.):
Kamo da idemo? Where should we go?
The verbs must be in the present tense to use such form. If you are asking about
what should have been, use the verb trebati in the past tense with another verb in
inf:
ŠtoA sam trebao raditi? What should I have been doing?

® The variants ko and šta are considered standard in Bosnia and Serbia. In Serbia,
and especially Bosnia, što is often used with meaning why.
The verb dešavati («) se² is considered standard in Serbia and most of Bosnia.
• Something Possibly Interesting
The to in š-to, not appearing in other cases, comes historically from forms like
these:
Što to radiš? What are you doing?
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 28 Asking Who and What
166 / 600

An older version of the question word was something like ča (it’s still used in some
regions of Croatia). The word to was so much used after the older question word
that it eventually fused with it, and lost its meaning. Later the word to was
introduced again.
Various versions of the question-word what are used as traditional criteria for
dividing various dialects in Croatia.
Russian, a not-so-distant relative of Croatian, still spells the question word что –
which is just čto, but in Russian Cyrillic script. (However, it’s pronounced što, the
same as in Croatian!)
The same happened in tko – the older form was kto, i.e. k + to. Again, Russian has
still the older form, while certain regions in Croatia have only ki.

29 Plural of Masculine Nouns and Adjectives
If the world were a simple place, Croatian masculine nouns would have their
nominative plural made just by adding an -i, and accusative plural just by an -e. Well,
it’s almost so, but there are few twists.
Most masculine nouns do simply get an -i in nominative plural:
krevet bed → kreveti beds
prozor window → prozori windows
tanjur plate (to eat from) → tanjuri plates ®
What about the accusative case? It has just an -e instead of -i:
GoranN pere zubeA. Goran is ‘washing’ his teeth.
(Yes, in Croatian, teeth are ‘washed’ and not ‘brushed’.)
And now, a few complications.
A few masculine nouns shift their stress in plural. One such noun is quite common:
mjesec moon/month → mjeseci
A couple of nouns that get simply an -i in nom. plural undergo a consonant change if
they end in either k, g or h. It does not happen in the accusative plural, only when an
-i is added (that is, in the N-pl):
N
N-pl
A-pl
putnik traveler
putnici
putnike
razlog reason
razlozi
razloge
uspjeh success
uspjesi
uspjehe
prozor window
prozori prozore
However, most one-syllable nouns (that is, nouns that have only one vowel) get a
longer ending; most of them -ovi:
brod ship → brodovi
grad city → gradovi
lijek cure → lijekovi
sin son → sinovi
vrt garden → vrtovi ®
zid wall → zidovi
(I hope you remember that e.g. lijek is just a spelling convention, the word is actually
pronounced as ljek, and therefore has only one syllable, so it gets longer endings for
plural.)
The consonant alternations described above (e.g. k → c) do not happen if the noun
gets longer endings in plural:
vlak train → vlakovi ®
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 29 Plural of Masculine Nouns and Adjec!ves
168 / 600

If such short nouns end in a Croatian-specific letter, they get -evi instead:
broj number → brojevi
ključ key → ključevi
miš mouse → miševi
nož knife → noževi
(It’s the same principle as for -om vs. -em for change of adjectives in masc. and
neuter genders.)
If one-syllable nouns end in a -c (it’s a Croatian-specific letter!) it turns into a č
before -evi:
princ prince → prinčevi
zec rabbit, bunny → zečevi
A few one-syllable nouns do not end in a Croatian-specific letter, but get -evi
nevertheless:
car emperor → carevi
sir cheese → sirevi
A couple of nouns often have -evi in everyday, colloquial communication, but
according to the rules of Standard Croatian, -ovi is preferred (I personally use -evi)®:
kut angle, corner ®
nos nose
pojas belt
put way
(The noun pojas belt, despite having two syllables, gets longer endings; more nouns
like that are listed below.)
Furthermore, there are a few exceptions: certain common one-syllable nouns get
simply an -i; they are listed here:
crv worm
đak pupil
dan day
gost guest
gumb button ®
keks biscuit
konj horse
mrav ant
pas (ps-) dog
I haven’t listed prst finger/toe and zub tooth since we have already learned them.
The noun đak gets the same alternation as putnik, so its N-pl is đaci.
There’s a quite odd noun that has different plural forms depending on its meaning:
sat hour → sati hours
sat clock, watch → satovi clocks, watches
The noun bol pain is usually feminine ®, but in plural, the masculine bolovi is quite
frequent, while regular boli is usually used for non-physical pains, and in poetry:
bol f pain → pl.  bolovi m (physical)
boli f (emotional, poetic)
There are nouns that have two syllables in nominative, but a one-syllable case-base.
Most such nouns get short endings, like any other two-syllable nouns:
glumac (glumc-) actor → glumci
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 29 Plural of Masculine Nouns and Adjec!ves
169 / 600

lonac (lonc-) pot → lonci
nokat (nokt-) fingernail/toenail → nokti
However, a few such nouns get longer endings, as one-syllable nouns do; the only
option is to remember them (the list below is not exhaustive):
bubanj (bubnj-) drum → bubnjevi
češalj (češlj-) comb → češljevi
dio (dijel-) part ® → dijelovi
lakat (lakt-) elbow → laktovi
otac (oc-) father → očevi
vjetar (vjetr-) wind → vjetrovi
There are several two-syllable nouns that usually get longer endings. Notably, they
include bird species:
galeb gull
golub pidgeon
labud swan
(The Core Dictionary lists all unusual plural forms of nouns included in it.)
The accusative case for longer plural again has just -e instead of the final -i:
Gledam brodoveA. I’m watching ships.
One masculine noun has a completely irregular plural, and one more has no real
plural but something else that will be explained a bit later:
čovjek man/human → ljudi people, men and women
brat brother → ?
The noun ljudi has a slightly different meaning than čovjek, it’s more generic, and
can be often translated as people. It also corresponds to the English phrase men,
women and children used to describe a mixed group. In a more narrow sense, it
corresponds to men and women (i.e. all adults). If you attempt to translate men and
women as ljudi i žene, it would sound extremely sexist – you would basically say
that women are non-human.
Unfortunately, there’s more: some nouns in N-pl have a bit unexpected – and
unsettled – spelling. They have case-base in -tk-; for example:
redak (retk-) line of text
početak (početk-) beginning
From everything you have learned so far, you would expect the forms:
N
DL
N-pl
A-pl
redak
retku
retci
retke
početak
početku
početci početke
However, since the sequence tc in N-pl is normally pronounced just as c, it was
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 29 Plural of Masculine Nouns and Adjec!ves
170 / 600

traditionally spelled without the t. On the contrary, more recent Croatian
orthography manuals mandate writing tc – and here’s a crazy thing – dc if the N has
a d! So, be prepared to see all possible variants®:
N
DL
N-pl
A-pl
redak
retku
reci
retci
redci
retke
početak
početku
počeci
početci početke
The most recent Croatian orthography manual allows also c-only forms for some
frequent nouns, such as:
gubitak (gubitk-) loss
ostatak (ostatk-) remainder
početak (početk-) beginning
predak (pretk-) ancestor
trenutak (trenutk-) moment
zadatak (zadatk-) task
But the noun redak (retk-) is not one of them! I expect there will be more changes in
the future regarding this group of nouns. (Google™ for forms preci, pretci and
predci on the .hr domain, to check frequencies. Don’t forget that the most regular
form – pretci – is non-standard, according to the latest manual.)
What about adjectives? They are much simpler – they just get the following endings
(equal to short endings for nouns) without any complications:
adjectives
N-pl
A-pl
masculine
-i
-e
This applies to past forms of verbs as well. For example:
Gledam velike brodoveA. I’m watching big ships.
GoranN ima prljave laktoveA. Goran has dirty elbows.
PsiN su bili gladniN. Dogs were hungry.

® Instead of tanjur plate, a slightly different word tanjir is used in Serbia and most of

Instead of vrt garden, the word bašta is much more common in Serbia for garden,
and it’s used alongside vrt in Bosnia.
Instead of vlak train, the word voz is used in Serbia and most of Bosnia. Instead of
kut, the word ugao (ugl-) is used for angle, corner in Serbia. That word is used in
Bosnia too, but you can find also kut in Bosnia.

The form nosevi is accepted as standard in Serbia, besides nosovi.
The masculine singular form bol m pain is much more frequent in Serbia.
In Serbia, the word dio (dijel-) m part has an unexpected “Ekavian” form deo (del-)
m; the plural is the expected delovi.
Serbian standard orthography allows only spellings like reci, preci, etc.
• Examples
For example, you can see here the plural of ruksak backpack – ruksaci:
(The term školske torbe is N-pl of školska torba school bag; školski is an adjective
derived from škola school; forming such adjectives will be explained in 33 School
Yard and Bunk Bed: Relations. Yes, the English phrase is an original part of the
poster.)
• Something Possibly Interesting
If you’re puzzled why almost all one-syllable nouns get -ov- in plural, the likely
answer is this: 1400 years ago, there was a small, but frequently used group of
masculine nouns, called u-nouns. Nouns sin son and dom home were among them
(they had a bit different shape back then). They had special case endings, some of
them containing -ov-.
From these nouns, the inserted -ov- in plural has spread to almost all one-syllable
masculine nouns.
Croatian standard language manuals universally condemn forms like noseve (A-pl of
nos), despite that form being 7 times more common (on the Internet) than nosove,
since they break the rule when the e-endings are used. In speech, forms nosevi and
noseve prevail almost completely. This is a textbook example of language
prescriptivism, i.e. forcing a rule that’s not respected in the language as it’s really
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 29 Plural of Masculine Nouns and Adjec!ves
172 / 600

used.
Spelling of nouns such as predak, sudac as so on is a matter of endless debate and
small differences in various spelling manuals published by various institutions in
Croatia.
Do you still think Croatian spelling is phonetic, obvious and simple?

30 Three Beers: Less than 5 Things
We’re now able to say two, able to say apples, able to say beers... but do we really
know how to say two apples or two beers in Croatian? Sadly, not really. So let’s
learn it!
Surprisingly, Croatian uses two different ways of counting things: one for numbers 2-
4, and another for larger numbers! I’ll show how to count less than 5 things first.
Words for some numbers adapt to the gender of the noun you count:
fem.
neut./masc.
both
obje
oba
obadvije
obadva (colloq.)
2
dvije
dva
3
        tri
4
        četiri
I have included the Croatian words for both, since they behave identically as the
words for two. The alternative forms obadvije and obadva are considered a bit
colloquial (opinions vary).
But what form of nouns comes after the number? If you have expected N-pl, you’ll
be surprised. It’s genitive singular (although it’s more than one thing). We can count
apples and ships now!
dvije jabuke two apples
dva broda two ships
dva prijatelja two friends
But what about using them in a sentence? Do they change as single nouns, e.g. in
accusative, etc.? No, such forms number-noun normally not change at all:
Imam dvije jabuke24. I have two apples.
Vidim dva broda24. I see two ships.
(Standard Croatian insists that numbers also change according to case. That’s very
rare in speech. If you’re interested, check 99 Aorist Tense and Other Marginal
Features.)
What about using adjectives (red, my) with counted nouns? Somehow, a special
thing happens – adjectives get special endings:
gender
adjectives (2-4)
fem.
-e
neut./masc.
-a
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 30 Three Beers: Less than 5 Things
174 / 600

f

It’s simple to remember, since the endings are identical to noun endings for the
majority of nouns, and to the end vowels of the number two:
Imam dvije crvene jabuke24. I have two red apples.
Vidim dva crvena broda24. I see two red ships.
Of course, the endings are different if you take masculine nouns in -a or feminine
nouns in a consonant:
Ovo su dvije duge riječi24. These are two long words.
You are maybe puzzled: why adjectives get the special endings? Why not just G
forms? Why genitive singular at all?
Actually, I oversimplified things a bit. After these numbers, nouns and adjectives
really have a special, so-called ‘dual’ form (also called ‘paucal’ form). It historically
had specific endings, but today its endings – for nouns – look like G endings.
However, if we were paying attention to vowel length, we’d see that the G ending
for nouns ending in -a, e.g. kod žene is a long vowel e, while the ending in e.g. dvije
žene is a short e. The forms just look the same in writing. However, since many
people in Croatia don’t distinguish short from long vowels, these endings often
coincide in speech as well. But ‘deep down’, the forms after numbers 2, 3, 4 and
both are not plain G forms. Adjectives still have specific endings.
When such counted nouns are subjects, verbs come in plural:
Dva prijatelja24 meA čekaju. Two friends are waiting for me.
Since past forms of verbs are really a sort of adjectives, they get special endings as
well:
Dva prijatelja24 su me čekala. Two (male) friends were waiting for me.
Dvije prijateljice24 su me čekale. Two (female) friends were waiting for me.
As in English, possessives often come before the number; since they are really
adjectives, they must get special endings as well:
Tvoje dvije knjige24 su kod AneG. Your two books are at Ana’s place.
Moja tri prijatelja24 su ovdje. My three friends are here.
This implies that plural is used in Croatian less than in English. For example:
dva čovjeka two men
tri djeteta three children
dva brata two brothers
četiri broja four numbers
As you can see, you talk about children and brothers without using their plural forms
(which are yet unexplained) if there’s not more than four of them:
Imam dva brata24 i jednu sestruA. I have two brothers and a sister.
However, numbers are mandatory. If there’s no number 2 to 4, you have to use
plural forms.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 30 Three Beers: Less than 5 Things
175 / 600

Sometimes you don’t know the exact number, it could be 2, it could be 3; one way
to express it is by joining numbers:
Imam dva-tri piva24. I have two or three beers.
Imam dvije-tri jabuke24. I have two or three apples.
You will see this written with a comma instead of hyphen, e.g. dva, tri. It’s also
common to join numbers 3 and 4 (tri-četiri).
There’s a twist: I’ve written above that numbers adapt to the gender of the noun.
And I’ve written that dva prijatelja means two friends. That’s not the full story.
Numbers described above cannot adapt in some circumstances.
In the case of mixed groups of people, where masculine nouns are used as a default
(e.g. when you use prijatelji friends for a group of friends of mixed sex), you cannot
use the numbers I have just described! This restriction holds even for četiri, a form
common for both genders.
That’s because Croatian has a specific set of numbers used for mixed groups or
people: they are described in detail in 47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Counting Children.
Therefore:
(both male)
dva prijatelja24 two friends
(both female) dvije prijateljice24 two friends
(mixed)
? → will be explained
However, if you are talking about animals, you can and should use the numbers
above even for mixed groups. For example, konji horses can mean an all-male
group, or a mixed group, so you’re free to say:
dva konja two horses (all-male or mixed)
Now, there’s a word that’s quite common in Croatian: još. We have seen it long ago.
It’s also used with numbers: you can place if before any quantity, to indicate it’s an
additional quantity:
Želim dvije jabuke24. I want two apples.
Želim još dvije jabuke24. I want two apples more.
Don’t forget, if you place it before a verb, it has another meaning – still:
Još želim dvije jabuke24. I still want two apples.
There are two more useful words that are often used before quantities:
bar / barem at least
čak even, as much as
There’s no difference between bar and barem. For example:
Trebam bar dvije čaše24. I need at least two glasses.
Imam čak tri tanjura24. I have even three plates.

So, you can finally order food and drink (basically all waiters in Croatia speak English
as well, so you could do it without any knowledge of Croatian as well). The most
common conversation would be something along these lines:
Imate li (A) ? Do you have...?
— Imamo. We have. / — Nemamo. We don’t.
Što imate? What do you have?
Molim VasA (A) I’d like...
For example, the last line could be:
Molim VasA dvije kave24. Two coffees, please.
Molim VasA tri mala piva24. Three small beers, please.
Molim VasA jedan hamburgerA. One hamburger, please.
Molim VasA dva čaja24. Two cups of tea, please. (lit. two teas)
Molim VasA tri velike pizze24. Three large pizzas, please.
Normally, we don’t say cup of coffee, bottle of beer etc. when we are ordering food,
because there’s no other option. But when ordering food that’s served on the plate,
and it’s not pizza, the word porcija serving, portion is often used. Of course, what
you are ordering comes after porcija, in G, while the word porcija changes to A or to
the 24 form:
Molim VasA (jednu) porcijuA piletineG. One serving of chicken, please.
Molim VasA dvije porcije24 piletineG. Two servings of chicken, please.
The number one is optional, but it’s often used in such sentences.
The same holds for wine, you can sometimes order it by glasses:
Molim VasA (jednu) čašuA vinaG. A glass of wine, please.
Of course, you can always order more:
Molim VasA još dva piva24. Two more beers, please.
Finally, it’s interesting that the verb moliti has two objects in such sentences, and
both are in A: the person asked, and what is asked.
There’s another way of asking for (and offering) food and drink, and it will be
introduced in the following chapter.

31 First, Second: Ordinals
We have just learned how to count things – at least up to 4 things. But there’s
another way of counting, with words first, second etc. They are usually called
ordinals or ordinal numbers, and behave as adjectives in Croatian. Their forms are:
1 prvi first
2 drugi second
3 treći third
4 četvrti fourth
5 peti fifth
6 šesti sixth
7 sedmi seventh
8 osmi eighth
Of course, the adjective drugi also means other.
For higher numbers, you should just add -i to them, if they consist of only one word:
17 sedamnaest → sedamnaesti
40 četrdeset → četrdeseti
If a number consists of more than one word, just change the last word into the
ordinal form; if a number is in a compact form (without the i) just change the last
part:
31 trideset i jedan → trideset i prvi
31 tridesetjedan → tridesetprvi
Pay attention that all ordinals are adjectives, i.e. they change case, gender and
number when needed:
17th sedamnaesti (masc. N)
        sedamnaestom (masc. DL)
        sedamnaestu (fem. A) etc.
One thing the ordinal numbers are used for in Croatian is for dates. In Croatian, e.g.
the year 1932 is understood as the ‘1932nd year’ or just the ‘thirty-second’ year.
In Croatian, when you want to say that something happened (or happens, or will
happen) on a given day, month or year (expressed as a date), you should put the
date in the genitive case.
Bilo je toN trideset i drugeG (godineG). lit. ‘It was in the 32nd (year).’ = It was in
thirty-two.
Also, days in a month are referred to as the first, the second (the same is in English,
but in the genitive case), and Croatian treats months in the same way: the first
month (in a year), the second... ®. Normally people would just say:
RođenN sam petog osmogG. ‘I am born on the fifth of the eighth.’ = I am born on the
fifth of August.
Of course, both petog and osmog are genitives of ordinal adjectives peti and osmi
(in masc.), since it’s just short for petog dana and osmog mjeseca – and both dan

178 / 600

and mjesec are masculine.
In the Croatian writing of numbers, ordinal numbers are abbreviated to just number
+ a period, so it’s usually written:
RođenN sam 5. 8.
This is the word used to describe a specific date:
datum date
If you want to talk about a date related to an event, you add the event in the
genitive case:
datum rođenja date of birth
To say that something happened/happens sometime in a given month, use u¨ + DL:
RođenN sam u osmom mjesecuDL. I’m born in August.
The word mjesec is sometimes abbreviated as mj.; colloquially, even mjesec month
can be left out:®
Idemo na moreA u sedmomDL. We’re going to seaside in July. ®
There are also names of months in Croatian, but they are mostly used in formal
writing, books, etc.; they are normally not capitalized (similar to days of week):®
1 siječanj (siječnj-) January
2 veljača February
3 ožujak (ožujk-) March
4 travanj (travnj-) April
5 svibanj (svibnj-) May
6 lipanj (lipnj-) June
7 srpanj (srpnj-) July
8 kolovoz August
9 rujan (rujn-) September
10 listopad October
11 studeni (adj.) November
12 prosinac (prosinc-) December
Of course, they must be also put to genitive when used in the above meaning (when
something happened/happens):
RođenN sam petog kolovozaA. (formal) I am born on the fifth of August.
RođenN sam u kolovozuDL. (formal) I am born in August.
When the date is the subject, the first word should be in nominative, but the rest of
the date must stay in the genitive case, since you are actually talking about the Xth
day of some month of some year and all those of’s correspond to the Croatian
genitive case:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 31 First, Second: Ordinals
179 / 600

PetiN kolovozaG je bio vrućN. (formal) The fifth of August was hot.
Again, the expression above is actually about peti dan the fifth day – therefore, the
past form is in masculine.
If you want to talk about decades (i.e. the seventies) you can simply use ordinal
adjectives in feminine plural (since you’re really talking about godine years, and it’s
feminine plural).
SedamdeseteN su bile davno. The seventies were long ago.
If a decade is the subject, as above, the verb goes into plural, and past forms and
adjectives are feminine, as expected. Decades are often written as a combination of
a number and a case ending, connected by a hyphen:
70-eN su bile davno. The 70’s were long ago.
Another very frequent use of ordinal numbers is talking about levels in a building.
Croatian uses the same scheme as British English – the floor above the ground level
is the first floor:
tavan
potkrovlje
attic
...
drugi kat
the second floor ®
prvi kat
the first floor
prizemlje
the ground floor
podrum
basement
The word kat ® means only storey, level in a bulding, not surface you walk on (the
other meaning of English floor). For surfaces, the word pod is used.
If you use only na katu (or direction na kat), the first floor is assumed:
KupaonicaN je na katuDL. The bathroom is on the first floor. ®
For prizemlje and podrum, you should use the preposition u¨; for all levels above,
the preposition na¨ is used:
KutijaN je u podrumuDL. The box is in the basement.
UredN je na drugom katuDL. The office is on the second floor. ®
IgračkeN su na tavanuDL. The toys are in the attic.
For attic, there are two terms: potkrovlje is more formal.
The adjective prvi is often used in spatial arrangements, when English usually uses
front instead:
prvi red front row (lit. ‘first row’)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 31 First, Second: Ordinals
180 / 600

prva crta front line (lit. ‘first line’)
There’s one instance when ordinals are used less than in English: when you just
enumerate things in no particular order, e.g. when you talk about your sisters:
Imam tri sestre24. I have three sisters.
JednaN radi u banciDL. One works in a bank.
DrugaN studira. Another is in university.
TrećaN je još u školiDL. The third one is still in school.
The first word is just an numeral adjective (used as a pronoun). The second one
means both another and second. After it, there’s no other option but to use ordinal
adjectives. The point is: there’s no first sister. But there’s the third one. You’ll find
out that native speakers prefer also speaking about one son and the other one,
rather than about the first son and the second one, and so on. You should use the
ordinal prvi first only when you want really to say that someone or somebody is at
the first position. After it, it doesn’t matter, since there’s no difference in Croatian.
The opposites of prvi first are:
posljednji
zadnji
   last
(The adjective posljednji is a bit more formal.) An example for zadnji:
AnaN živi na zadnjem katuDL. Ana lives on the top floor. (lit. ‘last floor’)
While in English, you can just use first as an adverb (e.g. first, you mix flour with
eggs...), in Croatian you must use its ‘adverbial’ form, that is, neuter singular prvo.
Instead of posljednje, the form na kraju is used in meaning finally.
However, in English, finally can also mean after so much time, after a long wait and
so on, like in we’re finally done. In that meaning, Croatian uses another word:
konačno finally (after a long time)
na kraju finally (as the last step)
This corresponds to Spanish por fin (konačno) vs. finalmente (na kraju).

® In Serbia, ordinal numbers are usually not used for months (except when reading
dates written as numbers); specific names – different than Croatian – are used even
in the colloquial speech:
1 januar January
2 februar February
3 mart March
4 april April
5 maj May
6 jun / juni June
7 jul / juli July
8 avgust August
9 septembar (septembr-) September
10 oktobar (oktobr-) October

As you can see, these names are similar to the English names. Those names also
prevail in Bosnia and Montenegro, and are sometimes used in Croatia too. Ordinal
numbers for months are infrequent in Bosnia and sometimes used in Montenegro.
The following words are less often used in Serbia and Bosnia (words more common
there are listed on the right side of arrows):
kat → sprat
kupaonica → kupatilo
ured → kancelarija

The song Moja prva ljubav My First Love, also known as Djevojke u ljetnim
haljinama volim Girls in Summer Dresses I like was a hit by Haustor, a band from
Zagreb. The song has very short lyrics:
DjevojkeA u ljetnim haljinamaDL volim
Girls in summer dresses I like
Ljubim ihA u leđaA
I kiss them in their back
mirišu na smoluA
they smell of resin
mojN je gradN večeras dobio lukuA
my town got a port this evening
UljeN je na vodiDL
There’s oil on the water
toN je, toN je...
that’s, that’s...
moja prva ljubavN
my first love
(Srđan Sacher)
The first verse contains a case yet unexplained: DL in plural. The verb mirisati
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 31 First, Second: Ordinals
182 / 600

(miriše) can mean either pleasant or unpleasant smell, and what something smells of
is expressed with na¨ + A. If you’re puzzled by imagery in this song, it’s from a
perspective of someone living inland and imagining his town became a seaside town
for a while, with the smell of resin from pine trees and oil from boats in the port.
Note how the verb ljubiti kiss uses a destination.
The song has unusual word order in some verses: normally, you would put the verb
first in the first verse. The fourth verse has moj grad my town (or my city) split by
strict placement of the verb je².
The verb dobiti (dobije) get is another perfective verb.
You can listen to the song on YouTube™, but there aren’t many videos for copyright
reasons. Check a great performance by young singers on the Croatian public TV
show A strana A Side, which are joined by the original singer (Darko Rundek).

32 Love and Like
There are two most common verbs used to express that you love or like something:
voljeti (voli, volio, voljela)   
sviđati se²
  love/like
The first verb is about lasting emotions (you love a person, a city) and the second
one about impressions, e.g. when you eat something and you like it, but also when
you feel someone attractive.
The first verb is straightforward to use, the object is in the accusative case, as usual:
GoranN voli AnuA. Goran loves Ana.
AnaN voli sladoledA. Ana likes ice-cream.
However, the second verb is a bit more complicated: the thing one likes is the
subject of the sentence, and who likes it comes in DL. For instance, if you’ve just
eaten a soup and you liked it, you could say:
Sviđa miDL se juhaN. I like the soup. ®
If e.g. Ana feels attraction or affection to someone (e.g. Ivan) – and it’s not
necessarily erotic, you can just like someone’s personality – one could say:
AniDL se sviđa IvanN. Ana likes Ivan.
This is probably quite familiar to you if you know some German, French, Italian or
Spanish, since all these languages have verbs that express like that behave exactly
the same (and use a form that corresponds to the Croatian DL):
(Spanish)
Me gusta el libro.
(Italian)
Mi piace il libro.
(French)
Le livre me plait.
(German) Das Buch gefällt mir.
Knjiga miDL se sviđa.
All five sentences above mean I like the book, but the book is the subject in all five
sentences, and the person who likes (I, emphasized in the sentences) is not the
subject. Therefore, all five verbs – Spanish gustar, Italian piacere, French plaire,
German gefallen and Croatian sviđati se² – are above in the 3rd person. The only
real difference is the word order, which follows quite different rules in Spanish,
Italian, German and Croatian (the French word order is here quite similar to the
Croatian order, though).
As with such sentences, in Croatian, what you’re talking about comes first: if you are
talking about Ana, she comes before the verb, but Ivan (or a book) is really the topic,
it can sometimes come to the first position in such sentence. (Of course, second
position words are always placed in the second position.)

Since what you like is the subject, and subjects are usually left out, this sentence can
have multiple meanings, depending on the context:
Sviđa miDL se. I like it/him/her.
The same holds for Spanish (me gusta) and Italian (mi piace), since both languages
usually omit subjects, if known from the context.
If you like something in plural, the verb, of course, must come in plural:
Sviđaju miDL se cipeleN. I like the shoes.
Sviđale su miDL se cipeleN. I liked the shoes.
Of course, you can also say:
Sviđaš miDL se. I like you.
Sviđaš se AniDL. Ana likes you.
Sviđala si miDL se. I liked you. (you = female)
The last sentence is in the past tense, and implies that it’s no more: something has
changed (either ‘you’ has died, or ‘I’ doesn’t like ‘you’ anymore).
You have a lot of freedom of what you can like with sviđati se² – it includes places
and times, which simply are used as subjects:
AniDL se ovdje ne sviđa°. Ana doesn’t like it here.
Sviđa° miDL se na moruDL. I like being at the seaside.
English here usually has to use either it or some form of the verb to be, but Croatian
does not (recall, there are no dummy pronouns in Croatian).
Since these subjects are not nouns or pronouns, verbs are impersonal, 3rd pers.
singular, and past forms must be in neuter singular:
AniDL se ovdje nije sviđalo. Ana didn’t like it here.
Sviđalo miDL se na moruDL. I liked being at the seaside.
Liking places and times is also often expressed with the adverb lijepo nice + DL + je²:
Lijepo miDL je° na moruDL. I like being at the seaside.
Bilo miDL je lijepo na moruDL. I liked being at the seaside.
Bilo miDL je lijepo jučer. I liked it yesterday.
The verbs are again impersonal.
You can like doing something: you should then put the right verb into the infinitive
and place it after one of the two verbs listed above, usually voljeti (voli,...):
AnaN voli trčati. Ana loves to run. ®
The verb in infinitive can have an object, and so on:
AnaN voli voziti biciklA. Ana likes to ‘drive’ bicycle. (= ride) ®
It’s interesting that we don’t ‘ride’ bicycles, but ‘drive’ them: jahati (jaše) ride is
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 32 Love and Like
185 / 600

reserved for horses and other animals.
To express that somebody generally likes running (which can imply just watching
others running, not running themselves), other words, so-called verbal nouns or
gerunds should be used:
AnaN voli trčanjeA. Ana loves running.
You can find more about verbal nouns in 66 Smoking is Dangerous: Verbal Nouns.
You can use adverbs of intensity with all such expressions, mostly jako and stvarno
to strengthen expressions, using the usual placement rules for such adverbs (the
intensifying adverb usually comes before the verb, but 2nd position words can
intervene):
Jako miDL se sviđa juhaN. I like the soup very much.
Bilo miDL je jako lijepo na moruDL. I liked being at the seaside very much.
AnaA stvarno voli trčati. Ana really likes to run.
It’s interesting that the more formal word vrlo cannot be used to strengthen verbs.
There’s another often used verb:
zanimati («) be interesting to
This verb is used in a similar way; however, the person who feels interest is
expressed in A:
GoranaA zanima nogometN. Goran is interested in football. ®
This Croatian sentence could also be translated as football is interesting to Goran
(it’s interesting that English here kind of follows Croatian).
This verb is used in a very common expression, used when you want to express that
you don’t really want to hear about something (the expression is not really polite,
however):
Ne zanima meA. I’m not interested.
Another verb is very similar to voljeti (voli,...) but stands for an even stronger
feeling:
obožavati («) adore, be fan of, really like
It can be used for people you really love, but also for actors, sports, food, activities
(including verbs in infinitive), etc.:
IgorN obožava kavuA. Igor ‘adores’ coffee.
AnaN obožava plivati. Ana ‘adores’ swimming.
The verb with the meaning opposite to love and like is:
mrziti hate ®
It’s used in the same ways as voljeti (voli,...):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 32 Love and Like
186 / 600

AnaN mrzi te cipeleA. Ana hates these shoes.
GoranN mrzi čistiti kućuA. Goran hates to clean the house.
Another verb that’s frequently used with another verb in inf is:
znati (+ inf) know how ®
This verb with a normal object in A means just know, but with inf it covers also
knowledge how to do something:
AnaN zna plivati. Ana knows how to swim.
Ne znamo plivati. We don’t know how to swim. = We can’t swim.
Actually, Croatian uses only znati in many instances where English would use can,
i.e. can read, can sing would be always expressed with znati in Croatian.
Colloquially, znati is also used for things that are done occasionally, or are known to
happen occasionally, like English may:
SnijegN zna padati i u desetom mjesecuDL. (colloq.) Snow may (is known to, does
sometime) fall in October as well.
(The use of i¨ to express as well will be explained in 67 Only, Except, Too: Inclusion
and Exclusion.)
There’s a fine difference: while moći implies just a possibility, znati implies that
something is known to happen (you see the connection with the verb know). It’s
possible not in principle, but because it does happen. This use is a bit colloquial, but
common.
There are more verbs that use other verbs in infinitive, you’ll encounter them later.
________
® In Serbia, infinitives are much less often used: in speech, the form da + present
prevails. For instance, such sentences would be much more common in Serbia:
AnaN voli da trči. Ana loves to run.
AnaN voli da vozi biciklA. Ana likes to ‘drive’ bicycle.
Knowledge of doing something is usually expressed in parts of Bosnia and
Montenegro with the verb umjeti (umije, umio, umjela) know how. In Serbia, the
same verb has the “Ekavian” form umeti. So, the sentences about knowing how to
swim would be like this in Serbia:
AnaN ume da pliva. Ana knows how to swim.
Ne umemo da plivamo. We don’t know how to swim. = We can’t swim.
The verb is fully regular, and like “Ekavian” razumeti understand, its pres-3 is umeju:
Ne umeju da plivaju. They don’t know how to swim. = They can’t swim.
This verb is also used in Serbia to express that something happens occasionally,
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 32 Love and Like
187 / 600

besides znati.
In Serbia and most of Bosnia, instead of juha and nogomet, supa and fudbal are
used.
In Serbia, the verb mrziti hate has the unexpected “Ekavian” form mrzeti (mrzi).
• Something Possibly Interesting
If we could travel back in time to the 15th century, we would find that the English
verb like behaved then exactly like Croatian sviđati se². For example, Thomas
Malory wrote in 1485 if it like you I will speak with them. You can find both uses in
Shakespeare’s works, but after him, the old way went into oblivion.

33 School Yard and Bunk Bed: Relations
Croatian contains a big number of adjectives derived from nouns (and sometimes
from other words too) that are often represented in English as nouns-used-as-
adjectives. Here’s what I mean:
school yard
Here school is actually used as an adjective, it describes what kind of yard it is, what
it belongs to. Such adjectives are sometimes called relational or quasi-possessive
adjectives. It’s interesting that such adjectives in English cannot have a comparative
(you cannot say more school) or even cannot be used as a property (you cannot say
the yard is school).
In Croatian, you cannot simply use nouns as adjectives – you have to turn them into
adjectives. It holds for some nouns in English too: you cannot use e.g. person as an
adjective (e.g. ‘person space’) you have to turn it into an adjective – personal.
The main way to turn nouns into adjectives in Croatian is to append -ski as if it were
a case ending (it’s not a case ending!):
brod ship → brodski
grad city → gradski
more sea → morski
škola school → školski
The resulting word is an adjective, so it must adapt to the noun case and gender.
Since dvorište yard is neuter (as expected) we have to use it accordingly:
OvoN je školsko dvorišteN. This is a school yard.
Bili smo u školskom dvorištuDL. We were at the school yard.
In some words that add -ski, the s gets fused with neighboring consonants and
vowels, and we sometimes get -ški, -čki or even -ćki, or other irregularities:
pošta post → poštanski postal
putnik passenger → putnički
Adjectives for cities, regions and countries are often irregular (and they are not
uppercase):
Bosna → bosanski
Dalmacija → dalmatinski
Istra → istarski
Slavonija → slavonski
Zagreb → zagrebački
Zagorje → zagorski
For countries, islands and cities that end in -s or -z, the final consonant is usually
assimilated into -ški:
Pariz Paris → pariški ®
Teksas Texas → teksaški ®
Tunis Tunisia → tuniški ®
Vis (an island) → viški
Relational adjectives are also created for cities having more than one word (e.g.
Banja Luka, a city in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and foreign ones, respelled according to
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 33 School Yard and Bunk Bed: Rela!ons
189 / 600

pronunciation:
Banja Luka → banjalučki New York → njujorški
(You will also see mixed spellings, e.g. newyorški.) You can find adjectives derived
from countries in L2 Countries and Nationalities, and adjectives derived from cities
and towns in L3 Cities and Towns.
Country adjectives (many of which are used as country names) such as danski
Danish, irski Irish etc. are also historically derived with the suffix -ski.
Recall, words like Hrvatska Croatia or Njemačka Germany are already adjectives,
just used as nouns – there’s no need to make adjectives from them.
All countries and cities derive relational adjectives by -ski (unless they are already
adjectives) – but, generally, not all words do. Many words add -ni instead, and
there’s no real rule which noun uses what ending, as you can see for adjectives
derived from seasons – you have to remember it:
jesen f autumn → jesenski
zima winter → zimski
proljeće spring → proljetni ®
ljeto summer → ljetni
Common adjectives that are derived with -ni are:
cvijet flower → cvjetni
kiša rain → kišni
kuća house → kućni
ljubav f love → ljubavni
osoba person → osobni ®
rad work → radni
rat war → ratni
soba room → sobni
stol table, desk → stolni ®
voće fruit(s) → voćni
vrt garden → vrtni
zid wall → zidni
Observe that adjective cvjetni has just je instead of ije. Consonants change before
this ending, e.g. k or c → č and so on, as in these examples:
brak marriage → bračni
krug circle → kružni
mlijeko milk → mliječni
ruka hand → ručni
noga leg → nožni
oko eye → očni
trbuh belly → trbušni
ulica street → ulični
(English has specific adjectives personal, marital and circular, but there’s no specific
adjective for many other nouns in English, e.g. hand is simply used as an adjective in
hand brake. English usually has specific adjectives if a noun is of French or Latin
origin, since these two languages have specific adjectives). Adjectives derived from
cardinal directions also follow this pattern:
sjeverni northern
zapadni western
istočni eastern
južni southern
A few adjectives in -ni have specific meanings; the most common one is:
glava head → glavni main
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 33 School Yard and Bunk Bed: Rela!ons

ići
It’s interesting that relational adjectives cannot be derived from days of week,
except for Sunday:
nedjelja Sunday → nedjeljni
(You will occasionally see and hear adjective subotnji adj. Saturday, but it’s quite
rare.)
It’s very useful to learn relational adjectives derived from time nouns (like English
day → daily, month → monthly); some of them are quite irregular:
dan day → dnevni
noć f night → noćni
jutro morning → jutarnji
večer f evening ® → večernji
mjesec month → mjesečni
godina year → godišnji
For the nouns tjedan (tjedn-) week, ponoć f midnight and podne (podnev-) noon,
adjectives are derived regularly by adding the -ni. For example:
OvoN je moj mjesečni prihodN. This is my monthly income.
Kupi neke dnevne novineA. Buy a daily newspaper.
The adjective godišnji annual is used in a common phrase:
godišnji odmor annual leave, paid vacation
The phrase is often – in speech and casual writing – shortened to just godišnji: the
noun odmor is assumed. So, you’ll often hear (and read):
IvanN je na godišnjemDL. Ivan is on (paid) vacation.
Sutra idem na godišnjiA. I’m going on (paid) vacation tomorrow.
Of course, even when used on its own, the word godišnji behaves like any adjective
and keeps the gender of the omitted noun (here: masculine inanimate). Therefore, it
got the DL ending -em in the first sentence (for "activity as location") and the A
ending in the second (for "activity as destination").
It’s also possible to derive relational adjectives from many adverbs, e.g. sad(a) now,
jučer yesterday, gore up and so on: they will be explained in 76 Inner and Outer and
Step by Step: More on Space and Time.
Few nouns have relational adjectives on -ji, again with (specific) consonant
alternations; they include most animals:
djeca coll. children → dječji ®
mačka cat → mačji
miš mouse → mišji
ptica bird → ptičji
riba fish → riblji
zec rabbit → zečji
There are frequently used adjectives to indicate what kind of meat something is
made of:
goveđi adj. beef
janjeći adj. lamb
pileći adj. chicken
teleći adj. beef (veal)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 33 School Yard and Bunk Bed: Rela!ons
191 / 600

f
Since relational adjectives cannot be simply derived from nouns, they will be listed
with nouns in the Core Dictionary.
The -ski is the default suffix for relational adjectives: new words that are adopted
into Croatian use it (translation for the words below is, I hope, not necessary):
atom → atomski
laser → laserski
However, nouns ending in -s or -t will likely get the suffix -ni:
balet → baletni
virus → virusni
There are probably more rules on -ski vs -ni, but I don’t know them at the moment.®
Certain terms in Croatian are not expressed in this way, especially when we describe
the purpose of something, e.g. where something is applied or where it’s used. Then,
the preposition za¨ + a noun in A are put after the noun. Common examples are:
čaša za vino wine glass
četka za kosu hair brush
krema za ruke hand cream
lak za nokte nail polish
pasta za zube toothpaste
šalica za čaj tea cup ®
Such constructions are used even in many cases when there seems to be an
appropriate relational adjective. For example, hand towel is only ručnik za ruke,
despite the relational adjective existing and being used in ručna kočnica hand brake,
ručni alat hand tool, and some others. Also, there is an adjective čajni, but it’s
basically used only in the expression čajni kolutić, which is a type of tea biscuit
(some 80% of appearances of čajni on the Internet are followed by kolutić: try it
yourself).
On the other hand, some of these terms have alternative versions, with relative
adjectives (e.g. zubna pasta toothpaste), but versions with za are more common in
speech.
Certain types of nouns, e.g. gerunds like čitanje reading don’t have relational
adjectives at all. To express reading glasses in Croatian, you have to use the same
construction:
naočale za čitanje reading glasses ®
štap za pecanje fishing rod
(More about gerunds in 66 Smoking is Dangerous: Verbal Nouns.)
Another way of expressing relation which does not use a relational adjective is with
na¨ + A, mostly placed after a noun, used as a predicative, or used as a kind of
(secondary) object. First, it can describe basically sources of power and energy:
peć na drvaA wood stove
svjetiljka na baterijeA battery-powered lamp
igračka na navijanjeA wind-up toy
Note how Croatian is more precise here. English wood stove is in principle
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 33 School Yard and Bunk Bed: Rela!ons
192 / 600

ambiguous. Is it maybe a proverbial stove made of wood? Croatian distinguishes peć
od drva (made of wood) from peć na drva (running on wood).
It can be also used with the verb raditi work, do describing how something works:
FenN radi na strujuA. The hair dryer runs on electricity.
This preposition (with A!) is frequently used in parts of phrases that describe
something; it’s never about the material, but some other distinctive property. For
example:
krevet na katA bunk bed (lit. ‘bed on floor/story’)
kupus na salatuA cabbage salad (lit. ‘cabbage on salad’)
plaćanje na rateA paying by installments (lit. ‘on installments’)
There are four very common, fixed combinations of na¨ + a noun in A, with non-
trivial meanings (except for one, which translates to English literally):
na primjer for example
na sreću fortunately, luckily
na vrijeme on time
na žalost unfortunately
All four are sometimes spelled as one word, e.g. naprimjer (both ways are
standard)®. The phrase na primjer is so common that is has a standard abbreviation
(the period is mandatory):
npr. = e.g.
This table summarizes various ways to express English ‘noun attributes’ in Croatian:

example
generic
rel. adj. +
školsko dvorište school yard
x of y

ključevi autaG car keys

material
+ od¨ G
sok od jabukeG apple juice
purpose
+ za¨ A
četka za kosuA hair brush
mode, power
+ na¨ A
peć na drvaA wood stove
All these constructions form phrases that can fill the first position in a sentence or
clause, and then second-position words normally come after them:
NaočaleN za čitanjeA su² na stoluDL. The reading glasses are on the table.
You will very rarely see these expressions split by second-position words, if ever.

® In Serbia, relative adjectives derived from Pariz, Teksas and Tunis have forms
pariski, teksaski and tuniski, while forms of these adjectives in -ški are rare and
considered non-standard in Serbia. This applies to most such nouns, but not to viški,
which is accepted also in Serbia. Conversely, forms like pariski are very rare in
Croatia.
Instead of proljetni, a more regular adjective proljećni is used in Serbia and
Montenegro, and sometimes in Bosnia; instead of osoba → osobni, lice → lični
covers that meaning in Serbia and Bosnia.
The noun stol table has the form sto (stol-) in Serbia and most of Bosnia, and the
derived adjective is a bit unexpected stoni.
The noun večer f evening has the form veče (večer- f) in Serbia and most of Bosnia,
but the derived adjective is the same, večernji.
Adjectives ending in -ji (e.g. dječji) have alternative forms ending in -iji (e.g. dječiji)
that actually prevail in Serbia and Bosnia and are accepted in standard there. They
are sometimes seen in Croatia as well.
Instead of šalica, the words šolja and šoljica are used in Serbia and parts of Bosnia.
Instead of naočale, words naočare and naočari are more common in Serbia and
most of Bosnia.
It appears that -ski is a bit more favored in Bosnia and Serbia: for example, from the
noun autobusʷ¹ there’s autobuski there, while there’s autobusniʷ¹ in Croatia.
Spellings such as naprimjer are not standard in Serbia, and are partially accepted in
Bosnia and Montenegro.
• Something Possibly Interesting
In Danish, the adjective Danish is dansk: you again see the -sk- to form adjectives. It
turns out that Croatian -ski, Danish (and Swedish and Norwegian) -sk, German -isch
and English -ish have a common origin. The -i- before -sk- was lost in Croatian, but
not before it had affected the preceding consonants: for instance, it had changed k
to č in putnik → putnički.
Each employee in Croatia has at least 4 weeks of godišnji, paid vacation, and often
more. For those who can choose when they want to use these days, there’s a whole
art of creating mini-vacations, by merging weekends with public holidays.
The adjective čajni is also used in čajna kobasica, literally tea sausage. This is often
shortened to just čajna, since the feminine form of the adjective is seldom used in
any other expression. However, it originally had nothing to do with tea; it seems it’s
a corruption of China.

This sign shows directions to a dog beach, which is literally beach for dogs in
Croatian:
The construction with na¨ + A is, a bit paradoxically, used to express ways of
entering or leaving – which door to use – e.g. on this notice (I found it on a bakery)
that the entrance is through the other door:
This is a bit unexpected if you consider it a location. But it’s not – it’s how to enter,
and the ‘modal’ na¨ + A is used.

34 Stressed Pronouns
Besides the forms of pronouns we have already learned, there are additional,
stressed forms of pronouns. They can be placed to any position in the sentence.
They are mostly optional, used when you want to emphasize them; however, they
must be used with prepositions and conjunctions. Their forms are similar to the
regular, ‘unstressed’ pronouns, but usually a bit longer:
1st & 2nd pers. pronouns in singular
person
N
A, G
DL
1st
ja
mene
meni
2nd
ti
tebe
tebi
refl.
—
sebe
sebi
Bear in mind that Croatian completely distinguishes 2nd person singular and plural,
while English has just you for both.
This example will illustrate their use when stressing objects:
AnaN čeka meneA. Ana is waiting for me.
You cannot join an unstressed pronoun and another word with e.g. conjunction i¨
and – stressed pronouns must be used:
Vidim tebeA i AnuA. I see you and Ana.
Despite the second position of tebe in the sentence above, the unstressed te²
cannot be used, since it cannot be joined with i¨ and with anything else.
When using stressed pronouns (which is not the default option in speech and
writing!) the order of words is more like English:
Želim vidjeti tebeA. I want to see you. ®
There’s the curious third row: A sebe, DL sebi, marked as reflexive. The word sebe is
the emphasized form of se². However, you cannot emphasize every se²: you can
emphasize it only when used in a specific meaning. Consider these sentences:
(1) Brijem se. I’m shaving.
(2) OniN se vole. They love each other.
(3) JuhaN se kuha. The soup is cooking. ®
(4) Vraćam se. I’m coming back.
(5) Zovem se IgorN. My name is Igor.
(6) Igram se. I’m playing.
(7) Bojim se. I’m afraid.
You can emphasize only the se² in the sentence #1, not in others:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 34 Stressed Pronouns
196 / 600

brijati
pisati
(1) Brijem sebeA. I’m shaving myself.
There’s a simple test to decide what you can emphasize: it can be done if you can
use myself and not you (or herself and not him, etc.) in English sentence. For
example, if you accidentally called yourself over the phone (e.g. your mobile phone),
you can emphasize it:
Zvao sam sebeA! I called myself! (or dialed)
To put it simply, you can emphasize se² as sebe only if someone is really doing
something to themselves – e.g. shaving, washing and so on. Such use of se² is
sometimes called true reflexive.
In other words, sebe never shifts the meaning, where se² does shift the meaning of
some verbs. For example:
Zabavljam se. I’m having fun.
Zabavljam sebeA. I’m entertaining myself.
The form sebe must be used when prepositions, adverbs and conjunctions are
involved. For example, with the adverb (iz)van outside there’s an often used phrase:
(iz)van sebe pred. furious, mad, freaking out
This implies extreme excitation, you can be (iz)van sebe because you’re really
happy, but most often it just means you’re really angry:
GoranN je bio van sebeG. Goran was freaking out.
Such small phrases that can be used only with the verb biti (je² +) be are sometimes
called predicatives, abbreviated as pred.
Like other stressed forms, sebe must be used when you want to want to add
something to the object, e.g. use i¨ and. It also must be used whenever you refer to
subject and need the genitive case:
Bojao se sebeG. He was afraid of himself.
In the last sentence, the se² is the particle, and sebe is the object in genitive.
What about the DL sebi? It’s used when you send something to yourself, and with
prepositions. There’s a matching unstressed form si²:
Pišem siDL porukuA. I’m writing a message to myself. ®
Unlike svoj, this form is never replaced colloquially by mi² or like.
I’ve emphasized more than once that possession of body parts (and clothes worn,
etc.) is normally implied, and when they don’t belong to the subject, a possessor in
DL is usually added. In western regions of Croatia, especially in parts of Istria and
the Zagreb region, you’ll sometimes hear that even when a body part or a piece of
clothing belongs to the subject, a DL possession is nevertheless expressed by si² –
which is exactly the same construction as in German:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 34 Stressed Pronouns
197 / 600

Perem siDL rukeA. (colloq.!, western parts)    I’m washing my hands.
Ich wasche mir die Hände. (German)
(Of course, it’s not required that you speak like that, but be prepared to hear and see
it occasionally in these regions. This feature is likely German influence.)
Here are the forms for plural – they’re almost identical to the unstressed forms:
1st & 2nd pers. pronouns in plural
person
N
A, G
DL
1st
mi
nas
nama
2nd
vi
vas
vama
Finally, here are the 3rd person forms. They are mostly like unstressed forms with
added n- or nje-:
3rd person pronouns
gender
N
A
G
DL
f
ona
nju
nje
njoj
n
(ono) njega
= A
njemu
m
on
f pl.
one
njih
= A
njima
n pl.
ona
m pl.
oni
With the stressed forms of personal pronouns, we are able to use prepositions. One
of them is za¨ for, requiring nouns or pronouns in the accusative case:
SendvičN je za AnuA. The sandwich is for Ana.
KolačN je za njihN. The cake is for them.
In the standard stress scheme, the stress shifts to unstressed prepositions (ones
marked with ¨), so it’s usually pronounced za mene.®
(In certain regions, you will maybe hear za me or za te, that is, using za¨ with the
unstressed 1st and 2nd person pronouns glued to them. It’s a bit archaic.)
It’s also quite common to use the preposition kod¨ + G with pronouns. The result is
a compact way to say where something is:
KnjigaN je kod meneG. The book is ‘at my place’.
This, as we have already seen, can mean that the book is in your house (even if
you’re not in the house at the moment!), your room, your backpack, or even pocket –
depending on the context. This is a convenient way to indicate temporary
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 34 Stressed Pronouns
198 / 600

possession of movable things.
Also, this is a very common way to express location ‘at our place’ (this corresponds
to German ‘bei uns’). Of course, this ‘us’ can imply your family, your friends, your
country – depending on the context:
Kod nasG pada kišaN. It rains ‘at our place’. (or here, etc.)
GoranN je bio kod nasG. Goran was at our house/home.
Another frequent use of stressed pronouns is in short responses to what others have
said. This is how it works:
Ovaj filmN je dosadanN… This movie is boring…
— MeniDL nije. lit. ‘Not to me.’
— I meniDL. lit. ‘Also to me.’
The first sentence tries to be an ‘objective statement’, while the responses are
opinions (by adding a person in DL): what I feel/think. Even if you rearrange words,
you cannot use short forms of pronouns in such responses.
Then, the stressed pronouns (esp. sebe) are used in A and DL, with the preposition
na¨, where someone is understood as either a destination or location, meaning
what he or she is wearing:
GoranN ima samo majicuA na sebiDL. ‘Goran has only a shirt on himself’. = Goran is
wearing only a shirt.
This use is a bit colloquial. More about the word samo only in 67 Only, Except, Too:
Inclusion and Exclusion.
You’ll encounter later more situations where the stressed pronouns have to be used.
________
® In Serbia, infinitives are less used, da + present is more common, so the example
would rather be želim da vidim tebe.
In Serbia and most of Bosnia, instead of juha soup, supa is used. The verb kuhati
cook has the form kuvati in Serbia and parts of Bosnia, and colloquially in some
parts of Croatia.
In Serbia, the DL pronoun si² is less common (except in the Southeastern Serbia) and
it’s not considered standard.
In Serbia, the stress very rarely shifts from pronouns to prepositions, za mene is
much more common.

This table includes the instrumental case (I) which we haven’t covered yet. The
interesting things is that some Croatian plural forms (e.g. njima) match Slovene dual
forms. In the history of Croatian, it happened that dual and plural have merged, and
some originally dual forms started being used even when there were more than 2
people, while the original plural forms were simply lost.
However, there are dialects in Croatia where some original plural forms are still
used. If your family is from certain parts of Croatia, some pronouns in the Slovene
table might better match the speech of your grandmother...

35 Tools and Means, With and Without
It’s time to introduce one more case. It’s called instrumental (just I for short), and
among other things, it has to do with instruments and tools. We’ll learn it in singular
first. The endings are:
noun type (N)
I
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -om
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) add -m
masc. nouns not in -a
add -om (some -em)
fem. not in -a (e.g. noć)
add -i
Some masculine nouns get ending -em instead of -om if they end in a Croatian-
specific letter – the same principle as for DL of adjectives. Two masc. nouns that get
plural on -evi despite not ending in a Croatian-specific consonant, get -em in
instrumental as well:
car emperor → carem
put way → putem
This is often seen with other nouns in -r as well, but it’s optional for them. Most
nouns ending in -c get -evi as well:
otac (oc-) father → ocem
stric uncle → stricem
There are many uses of the instrumental case – some quite surprising, involving time
and so on – but the use it got named after is for tools and means. For instance:
Pišem olovkomI. I’m writing with a pen.
Putujem vlakomI. I’m traveling by train. ®
These are often used nouns for means of transportation:
auto (aut-) m car
autobusʷ¹ bus
avion airplane
bicikl bicycle
brod ship
taksi (taksij-) m taxi
tramvaj tram
vlak train ®
For example:
Na posaoA idem biciklomI. I go to work by bicycle.
The instrumental case of noga foot is not used to express that you walk, it’s used
only as a ‘tool’, e.g. if you kick something with your foot. There are specific adverbs
in Croatian to express ‘by foot’, as a way of transport:
pješke / pješice by foot
There’s another way to express tools, mostly when you want to emphasize that you
used a tool, especially an unusual tool for the task:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 35 Tools and Means, With and Without
202 / 600

pomoću + G using
Certain verbs use objects in the instrumental case. One of them is:
baviti se² be engaged in/with, pursue
This verb looks hard to translate, but it simply means you are doing something (often
regularly), either as your paid job, as a kind of duty, work at home, or as recreation.
For example:
MarkoN se bavi sportomI. Marko is doing sports.
The personal pronouns have the following forms in the instrumental case (there are
no shorter and longer forms in instrumental, only one form exists):
pers. (NN)
 I
1st (ja)
mnom
2nd (ti)
tobom
refl. (self)
sobom
3rd f (ona)
njom
3rd n (ono) njim
3rd m (on)
The instrumental case of nouns and pronouns is often used with several
prepositions. Often used ones are:
pred¨ + I in front of
s¨ / sa¨ + I with
This is the same s¨ / sa¨ as used with G, it just has a different meaning with I. It’s
often used with the following verbs:
igrati se² play
razgovarati («) talk, discuss
For example:
IvanN razgovara s MarijomI. Ivan is talking to Marija.
GoranN se igrao sa mnomI. Goran was playing with me.
With the I of the pers. pronoun ja – mnom – the longer sa¨ is always used, and both
words are pronounced together, with the stress on the preposition: "samnom".
Otherwise, normal rules for s¨ vs. sa¨ apply; the rules are often violated in real life in
favor of sa¨, as on this (officially installed) parking sign in Zagreb:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 35 Tools and Means, With and Without
203 / 600

Don’t forget that some words get -em in the instrumental case:
AnaN je razgovarala s prijateljemI. Ana was talking to her (male) friend.
The opposite meaning is expressed by another preposition with the genitive case:
bez¨ + G without
For example:
GoranN se igrao bez meneG. Goran was playing without me.
According to the rules of Standard Croatian, you shouldn’t use s / sa for tools, only
for company, but, colloquially, it’s not always so; you’ll often hear and read pišem s
olovkom.
Both prepositions can be used with other cases, and then they have other meanings:
pred¨ can be used with the accusative case, and then it stands for a destination.
The following two adverbs mean more or less the same, but skupa is a bit informal:
skupa
zajedno  
   together
For example (these words can go to any place in the sentence):
Gledali smo zajedno filmA. We watched the movie together.
They are often used together with s¨ / sa¨ to emphasize something is done together
(with someone else), as English together with:
Gledao sam filmA zajedno s prijateljemI. I watched the movie together with my
friend.
Then, there’s an adjective that’s opposite to company:
sam alone
Since it’s an adjective, it must adapt to the gender of the subject:
GoranN se igrao samN. Goran was playing alone.
MartinaN se igra samaN. Martina is playing alone.
Igramo se samiN. We play alone. (all male/mixed group)
Like in English, this adjective is not attached to the noun, it’s just a word in the
sentence (but it must change the case, gender and number in Croatian!). Such
additional adjectives are often called secondary predicates.
The preposition pred¨ refers to a location – simply in front of something (that goes
in the instrumental case):
AnaN je pred kućomI. Ana is in front of the house.
In the instrumental case, adjectives get the following (fairly simple) endings (you
might notice they are identical to endings of the 3rd person pronouns, and that
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 35 Tools and Means, With and Without
204 / 600

ići
there are again only 2 endings to remember: one for feminine, another for
everything else):
gender
adj. I
example
fem.
-om
velikom ribom
big fish
neut.
-im
velikim jezerom
big lake
masc.
velikim konjem
big horse
When you compare adjectives in DL, G and I, you see there are only two different
endings in singular:
gender
adj. DL
adj. G
adj. I
fem.
-oj
-e
-om
neut.
masc.
-om
(-em)
-og
(-eg)
-im
Therefore, Croatian adjectives have much fewer different endings than they could in
principle have!
Question-words tko who and što what have the following forms in instrumental (as
expected, as they change like adjectives):
 N
 I
who
tko
kim(e)
what
što
čim(e)
To ask about means, you can use either kako how or čim(e):
Kako idete na moreA? How do you go to the seaside?
— AutomI. By car.
With verbs of motion, such as trčati (trči) run, šetati (šeće/šeta) ® stroll, walk, etc.
the instrumental case can be used to indicate where the whole action happened. It’s
usually translated with through:
Trčali smo šumomI. We were running through the forest.
The preposition za¨ is used with the instrumental case, to indicate that you’re sitting
behind something or at something. It’s usually used with the following expressions,
and the verbs biti (je² +) be and sjediti sit:
za stolom at the table
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 35 Tools and Means, With and Without
205 / 600

za volanom
   behind the
  (steering) wheel
za upravljačem  
(Both volan and upravljač mean steering wheel; the former noun is colloquial, the
latter is standard.)
With verbs of motion, za¨ + I indicates following something or someone:
Trčali smo za njomI. We were running after her.
Three final remarks: first, certain feminine nouns that don’t end in -a have
alternative I forms, e.g.
riječ word → riječju
sol salt → solju
Both forms are standard, some people prefer the forms in -ju, but the forms in -i are
actually much more common in speech.
Second, masculine names in -io (which always have -ij- whenever anything is added
to them) have two possible I forms, and both are used:
Mario (Marij-) →
Mariom
Marijem
Third, according to Standard Croatian, most one and two syllable masc. nouns which
would get -em, but have the vowel -e- before it, get -om instead. Classic examples
are:
jež hedgehog → ježom 
muzej museum → muzejom
However, in speech and casual writing, versions with -em are common too: you’ll
see and hear ježem as well, and muzejem is likely more common in speech. This
never applies to longer nouns (e.g. prijatelj friend), which get always -em, and
doesn’t apply to some two-syllable nouns as well – the feature is actually irregular.
________
® Instead of vlak, the word voz is used for train in Serbia and most of Bosnia. The
pres-3 form šeće is specific to Croatia; in Bosnia and Serbia, the form šeta is used.
• Something Possibly Interesting
If you search the Internet, you’ll find a number of pages discussing whether
muzejom or muzejem is ‘right’. The mere existence of such pages should inform
you there’s some variation in speech and writing, and you can expect both variants.
You won’t find any discussions about autom vs. autem – only one form is used.

The following verse contains a phrase in instrumental to indicate where the sailing
happens: dalekim morem (the N would be, of course, daleko more). However, that
phrase is split by the adverb sad now, and with the verb, likely for rhythmic reasons.
It’s still grammatical, just uncommon:

explained in 62 The Friend I Saw: Relative Clauses). Also, it says literally beating into
face and soul.

36 Dative/Locative and Instrumental Plural
We know now how to form the nominative plural of nouns, and how to form the
accusative in plural, but we still don’t know how to make the dative/locative plural
(DL-pl) or the plural of the case we introduced in the previous chapter, the
instrumental case.
Both cases are quite simple to form, and they are always equal in plural. Nouns get
the following endings:
noun type (N)
DLI-pl
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -ama
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) -o, -e → -ima
masc. nouns not in -a
N-pl + ma
fem. not in -a (e.g. noć)
N-pl + ma
As you can see, all nouns end in either -ama or -ima in DLI-pl. There are no
additional sound changes in this case: if you know how to make N-pl, you know how
to make these two cases as well!
For example:
Putujemo rođacimaDL. We’re traveling to our relatives.
PticeN sjede na granamaDL. Birds are sitting on branches.
Stojim pred vratimaI. I’m standing in front the door.
(Recall that the noun vrata door exists in plural only.) In the following example you’ll
see how DL = I in plural:
Pišem porukuA prijateljimaDL. I’m writing a message to my friends.
U kinuDL sam s prijateljimaI. I’m in the movie theater with my friends. ®
Of course, we must be able to put adjectives into DLI-pl as well. It’s simpler than you
probably would expect:
gender
adj. DLI-pl
example
fem.
-im
velikim ribama
big fishes
neut.
velikim jezerima
big lakes
masc.
velikim stolovima 
big tables
What about pronouns? We have already seen DL case of personal pronouns, both in
singular and in plural, and instrumental case in singular. The instrumental case in
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 36 Da!ve/Loca!ve and Instrumental Plural
208 / 600

ostajati
ostajati
ići
plural is identical to the DL-pl forms, but only stressed forms are used – there are no
unstressed forms of instrumental. Pronouns tko who and što what have singular
forms only anyway.
Something quite special happens with adjectives used as nouns or pronouns. For
example, the ‘noun’ mladi m pl. (adj.) is actually an adjective, short for mladi ljudi
young people or the young. Look what happens when it’s used in DLI-pl:
Na mladim ljudimaDL svijetN ostaje. The world is left to the young people.
Na mladimaDL svijetN ostaje. (the same meaning)
The verb ostajati (ostaje) means remain. As you can see, if an adjective is used as a
noun, it gets an additional -a in DLI-pl, essentially giving it the same ending as any
masc. or neuter noun. This happens only in the DLI-pl.
The second, shorter sentence is a common proverb in Croatian, corresponding to
English the young shall inherit the earth.
An exception to this rule are ordinal numbers in plural that refer to decades. The
otherwise obligatory -a in DLI-pl is optional for them and often left out:
BeatlesiN su bili popularniN u šezdesetimDL. The Beatles were popular in the sixties.
U 80-imDL sam bio u vrtićuDL. I was in the kindergarten in 80’s.
(Note how the English name Beatles gets a Croatian case ending for N-pl.)
The following preposition is used with instrumental when you have more than one
thing, or a collective noun:
među among
For example:
PticaN se skriva među lišćemI. The bird is hiding ‘among’ the leaves.
Tražim pismoA među papirimaI. I looking for the letter among the papers.
The noun lišće is a collective noun, so we used instrumental singular (collective
nouns have no plural), but the noun papir paper is a regular noun so we used DLI-pl.
The preposition među can be used with A as well, then it stands for a destination.
This is maybe the right place to list prepositions using instrumental or accusative:
prepositions using I or A
pred¨
in front of
nad¨ above
među among
pod¨ under
(za¨)
behind
With these prepositions, you have to use I for locations, and A for destinations:
Idem pred publikuA. (A = dest.) ‘I’m going in front of the audience.’

209 / 600

plesati

trčati
m
Plešem pred publikomI. (I = loc.) I’m dancing in front of the audience.
However, za¨ + A usually means for, so za¨ + A is almost never used as a destination
– iza + G is much more preferred, while za¨ + I is used only in some set expressions,
or meaning following:
Trčim za tebeA. (A) I’m running for you. (not behind you)
Trčim za tobomI. (I) I’m running after you. (i.e. following)
These 5 prepositions are similar to u¨ and na¨ – which use DL for locations, and A
for destinations – and even more in plural, since the DL case (used for u¨ and na¨)
and the I case for the 5 prepositions above coincide then:

loc.
dest.
u¨ in, into
na¨ on, at, to
 DL
 A
nad¨ above
pred¨ in front of
među among
pod¨ under
(za¨ behind)
 I
 A
The 5 prepositions listed above have longer versions, which are used with G, and
don’t distinguish location vs. destination. The longer prepositions, starting with iz- or
is- are more common in speech and mean the same when talking about spatial
relations (i.e. locations and destinations):
longer prepositions (always use G)
ispred
in front of
iznad above
između between
ispod under
iza
behind
For example:
AutoN je iza kućeG. The car is behind the house.
However, there is an important difference between ispred + G and pred¨ + I/A: the
latter combination includes temporal and metaphoric relations as well, so it’s only
possible to use pred¨ in the following expressions (here expressing metaphorical
‘locations’, so using I):
pred publikom before the audience
pred sudom before the court
The same applies to other prepositions, e.g. you can only use pod¨ to express that
someone is ‘under pressure’ (pod pritiskom), while you can use both pod¨ and ispod
to express that something is under the bed – and ispod is more common in such
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 36 Da!ve/Loca!ve and Instrumental Plural
210 / 600

p

non-metaphorical uses.
Something different happens when using pred¨ in the temporal sense, like English
before, the accusative case must be used always:
pred jutro before the morning
pred kišu before the rain
pred zimu before the winter
(Strangely, some Standard Croatian manuals discourage use of pred¨ + A in the
temporal sense, but it has been used for centuries in speech and literature.)
There’s yet another difference: među is mostly used when there are more than two
things or persons (i.e. among) while između usually means between, i.e. when there
are two things or persons.
Now you know how to create almost all forms of nouns. There are only two cases
left unexplained: genitive plural and the vocative case. They will be explained in 44
Genitive Plural and 72 Addressing and Vocative Case.
(There are certain dialects in Croatia where DL is not equal to I in plural, actually,
where D, L and I are have different endings. They will be briefly summarized in the
section A8 Dialects.)

37 Complete Reading: Perfective Verbs
I’ve already mentioned that some Croatian verbs stand for accomplishments, while
most verbs stand for processes (there are more types, but these two are the most
common). This distinction – an essential feature of Croatian verbs – is called verbal
aspect (or grammatical aspect).
The following two sentences illustrate the essence of verbal aspect:
Jučer sam čitala knjiguA. I was reading the book yesterday. (some of it)
Jučer sam pročitala knjiguA. I read the book yesterday. (completed it)
Now, the second sentence means that you completed the reading yesterday. You
could, in principle, have started earlier, but the essential part, the accomplishment,
was done yesterday. And this is constantly expressed in Croatian: whether there was
a completion of the action or not. Using the first sentence implies there was some
reading, but not if you completed it or not.
In previous versions of this ‘course’, I translated pročitati as read through. But that’s
not accurate: read through implies careful, close reading, when you pay close
attention, or look for errors. The verb pročitati has no such implications – it just
implies the reading is completed.
Therefore, one English verb (read) corresponds to two Croatian verbs: čitati and
pročitati. So, how to make perfective verbs?
Some perfective verbs are obtained from impf. verbs just by adding a prefix.
Unfortunately, not all verbs get the same prefix. Some get po-, for instance:
imperfective verb
perfective
jesti (jede) eat
pojesti (pojede)
piti (pije) drink
popiti (popije)
slati (šalje) send
poslati (pošalje)
Since it’s important to remember both verbs, the only option is to remember verbs
in pairs. I will indicate them with the impf. verb on the left, perf. on the right,
separated by a tilde (~):
  impf.
    ↓
  perf.
    ↓
čitati
 ~ pročitati
 read
piti (pije) ~ popiti (popije) drink
To simplify things even further, if a perfective verb differs just by a prefix, I’ll show
just the prefix, e.g.:
čitati ~ pro- read
piti (pije) ~ po- drink
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 37 Complete Reading: Perfec!ve Verbs
213 / 600

If the prefix has the stress mark, as above, it means that the stress will be on the
prefix in the Standard pronunciation. However, for almost all verbs, it will never be
on a prefix in the ‘western’ pronunciation: it will stay on the same syllable as in the
unprefixed verb.
Some verbs make their perfective verbs by prefixing na-:
crtati ~ na- draw, sketch
puniti ~ na- fill
slikati ~ na- paint (image)
hraniti ~ na- («) feed
pisati (piše) ~ na- («) write
učiti ~ na- («) learn
The stress in nahraniti, napisati and naučiti doesn’t move to the prefix in the
infinitive, but (only in the Standard pronunciation!) it does move in the present tense:
therefore, their present tense forms are nahrani, napiše and nauči. I will, as usual,
indicate such shift in the present tense with just a («).
Others use o- or pro-:
brijati (brije) ~ o- shave
prati (pere) ~ o- (») wash
buditi ~ pro- («) waken
gutati ~ pro- swallow
The stress – both Standard and ‘western’ – in oprati moves one syllable to the right
in the present tense: opere; I will abbreviate such stress shift with a (»), as above.
Other pairs have more complicated ‘relationships’. Here are the main types of pairs
(besides prefixing pairs). A common type involves a change of verb ending:
bacati ~ baciti throw
primati ~ primiti receive
Within this scheme, most pairs always change the final consonant before the
ending:
plaćati ~ platiti pay
prihvaćati ~ prihvatiti accept ®
vraćati ~ vratiti return
(It’s worth remembering that, in such pairs, the impf. verb most often has a
Croatian-specific consonant, while the perf. verb has an ordinary consonant.)
Many verbs in this scheme also change the vowel before the final consonant, always
a vs. o:
odgađati («) ~ odgoditi («) postpone
otvarati («) ~ otvoriti («) open
Another scheme, used by many pairs, is that impf. verbs have -ava-, and the perf.
verbs just -i- or -a- (some pairs have change of consonant as well):
pokušavati («) ~ pokušati try
ukrašavati ~ ukrasiti («) decorate
Finally, there’s a very common scheme – likely, including the highest number of verb
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 37 Complete Reading: Perfec!ve Verbs
214 / 600

napisati | poslati | 3m/n
pasti past-f | f
pairs – where impf. verbs have -iva-, which changes in pres-3 to -uje, while perf.
verbs just -i- or -a- (again, some pairs have change of the consonant before all these
endings):
odlučivati (odlučuje) ~ odlučiti («) decide
uspoređivati (uspoređuje) ~ usporediti («) compare
Since such impf. verbs tend to be long, I’ll often list them just by showing change in
the variable part, and the constant and variable part will be split by a thin vertical
line ():
Shorthand for -ivati/-uje verbs
instead of
uspoređivati (uspoređuje)
I’ll write just
uspoređivati (-uje «)
The symbol « will be there to remind you of the stress shift in the present tense,
which here applies to both Standard and ‘western’ stress patterns.
There’s no need to learn these schemes now: they are here just to show you what
lies ahead. There’s no simple rule how to make a perfective verb – the pairs must be
learned, but most of them fall into the small number of schemes above.
When should you use perf. verbs?
Perfective verbs are almost never used in the true present tense, for an ongoing
action. However, it is possible to use perf. verbs in the present tense – if we use the
present tense to describe things that happened in the past and will happen in the
future, especially when adverbs često often and ponekad sometimes are used:
Ponekad napišem pismoA i ne pošaljem gaA. Sometimes I
write a letter and don’t send it.
Why have I used perf. verbs, e.g. poslati (pošalje)? Because sending is not something
where any progress matters (e.g. even reading a few pages from a book can
matter). Sending is normally done in one go, not split into parts. So it’s only
important that the action was not completed. The first sentence talks about
accomplishments. Letters are completed, but not sent.
For most verb pairs, in the past tense, perf. verbs are usually used, unless the action
was interrupted, you describe what you were doing at some moment, or it’s not
clear what the outcome was. Also, you can tell how long something was happening
only if you use an imperfective verb, e.g. these adverbs of time can be used only
with imperfective verbs:
dugo for a long time
kratko for a short time
For example:
Pala je noćN. The night fell.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 37 Complete Reading: Perfec!ve Verbs
215 / 600

pasti past-f
piti
popiti
KišaN je dugo padala. ‘The rain was falling’ for a long time.
KišaN je pala. ‘The rain fell’.
Perfective verbs are so often used in the past tense that some people would answer
that the past form of the verb padati is pao! Another example:
Platio sam pićeA. I paid for the drink. (done)
Plaćam pićeA. I’m paying for the drink. (right now or about to do it)
If you want to express that something has happened moments ago, you can use the
adverb sad(a) now with a perf. verb in the past tense:
Sad sam se probudio. I’ve just woken up.
Since perf. verbs stand for accomplishments, you must often tell exactly what you
did, even if you don’t have to with the impf. verb:
Čitao sam. I was reading (something).
Pročitao sam knjiguA. I have read the book. (must say what)
You should use perf. verbs if there’s an indication what was produced, absorbed or
consumed, even if the amount is not exact. In the sentence #1, it’s not clear at all
how much is consumed each time, the action is very generic:
(1) Ponekad pijem vinoA. I drink wine sometimes.
(2) Ponekad popijem malo vinaG I drink little wine sometimes.
In the sentence #2, it’s stated how much is consumed, so we use a perf. verb (here
both verbs are in the present tense, since we’re talking about occasional events; but
this applies to all tenses).
Whenever there’s a focus on action – not on what was actually accomplished – you
should use impf. verbs in Croatian:
We were building houses. → impf. in Croatian
We built three houses. → perf. in Croatian
The first sentence has emphasis on action: what the result was isn’t said, what was
successfully built – if anything! Such a sentence will use an impf. verb in Croatian.
But the second sentence tells exactly what was accomplished, and such a sentence
uses a perf. verb in Croatian. Since people talk about both – what they were doing
and what they accomplished – Croatian (as all Slavic languages, from Russian to
Czech) treats it as different things, and has a different verb for each of them.
What about we built houses? If you imply that the houses mentioned were really
completed, it’s perf. in Croatian.
Sometimes, two verbs that make a pair are different in English as well:
Puno sam učila. I studied a lot.
Puno sam naučila. I learned a lot.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 37 Complete Reading: Perfec!ve Verbs
216 / 600

3f A
There’s another very rough rule: impf. verbs often correspond to English continuous
tenses (I was reading) while perf. verbs often correspond to simple tenses or perfect
tenses (I read, I’ve read). For example:
I was getting hungry. → impf. in Croatian
I got hungry. → perf. in Croatian
A major exception to this rule is that states, usually represented with non-
continuous tenses in English (I am, I live, I love, I sleep), in Croatian always use impf.
verbs.
Also, although there are perfective counterparts of gledati watch and slušati listen –
for example, you just prefix po- to gledati – they are much rarer than you would
expect. Normally only impf. verbs are used to say or ask if someone watched or
listened to something.
When you use verbs with negation, the negated perf. verbs state that the action was
not complete, but it might be ongoing:
Nisam čitao knjiguA. I haven’t read the book (at all).
Nisam pročitao knjiguA. I haven’t read the book (completed it).
While the first sentence means you haven’t read the book at all, the second only
says you haven’t read the book in its entirety, haven’t completed it. It’s not stated if
you have read any part of it or not. So, both answers are possible:
Jesi li pročitao knjiguA? Have you read the book (completed it)?
— Nisam, još jeA čitam. No, I’m still reading it.
— Nisam ni počeo. I haven’t even started.
The verb početi (počne) is a perf. verb meaning start; it will be explained in the
following chapters. The word ni emphasizes the negation; it will be explained in 67
Only, Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion.
If you use the present tense for a future action, e.g. I’m leaving tomorrow, this is
(like in English) understood as an extension of the present moment, and
consequently, impf. verbs must be used. Again, English continuous tenses
correspond to Croatian impf. verbs.
There are a couple of impf. verbs that show some characteristics of perf. verbs;
important ones are:
čuti (čuje) hear
razumjeti (razumije,...) understand  
vidjeti (vidi,...) see
   perf-like
  verbs
These verbs are ‘really’ perf. verbs, but are used as imperfective in most situations.
However, you cannot tell how long with these verbs (except in a specific
construction which will be shown later). You can use them in the present tense (and
they’re frequently used) but even English translation changes a bit in the present

following chapter.
________
® In Serbia, the impf. verb prihvaćati is used in a slightly different form: prihvatati;
there’s no difference for the perf. verb.
• Something Possibly Interesting
If you were reading very carefully, and thinking about stress shifts, you maybe
noticed that the present tense form uči is weird: when you put ne¨ before it, the
standard stress stays put, but when you add prefix na-, the stress does move to the
prefix. Unfortunately, this doesn’t apply to all verbs with an ‘underline’: the verb
čitati moves stress neither to ne¨ nor to a prefix.
Did I say the standard stress is quite complicated, even in my watered-down form?
• Examples
This pop song from the 1990’s, S dlana Boga pala si, performed by En face – a
Croatian band from Rijeka, despite its name – featuring Damir Urban, was a major
hit.
In the following verses, there are both perfective verbs (highlighted) and
imperfective verbs:
S dlanaG BogaG pala si
From the palm of God you fell
I anđeluDL si krala mirA
And were stealing peace from an angel
Kao kišaN rasula kapi sveA
Like rain, you scattered all the drops
U peharA skupljam tvoje riječiA
Into a chalice I’m collecting your words
  i pogledA i tvoj prahA
  and look and your dust
(Vlado Simcich Vava)
The two perf. verbs are:
pasti (padne, pao) perf. fall
rasuti (raspe) perf. scatter, spill around
The second verb has a quite unexpected present tense form. They represent events
in the past which are done, completed, no need to go into details. But there’s also
an impf. verb in the past tense in the verses:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 37 Complete Reading: Perfec!ve Verbs
218 / 600

krasti (krade, krao) impf. steal
Here the focus is on the process, and not on the completion. If the song had ukrala,
which is the past form of perf. steal, it would mean the angel lost the peace. I tried
to translate this difference with the English Past Continuous Tense. Pay attention
how the angel is in DL: literally, ‘stealing the peace to an angel’.
Besides, this song contains a number of poetic constructions which are very rare in
normal speech. For example, instead of expected sve kapi all drops, the order
adjective-noun is inverted; then, check the position of si² in the first verse, and so
on...

38 Needs, Wishes and Intentions
Let’s now see how to say I want to sleep or Ana intends to go to Zagreb. Such
expressions are quite simple in Croatian. You should use one of verbs of desire and
intent:
morati must
namjeravati («) intend
planirati («) plan
pokušavati («) try
trebati need/should
željeti (želi, želio, željela) wish
All these verbs are imperfective, and have no perfective verbs related to
accomplishments. (You’ll see later that, in fact, there are a few weird perfective
verbs related to some of the verbs above, but they don’t stand for
accomplishments.) For example, if you wish/must/intend to eat an apple, you should
simply say:
Želim jesti jabukuA. I want to eat an apple. ®
Moram jesti jabukuA. I must eat an apple.
Namjeravam jesti jabukuA. I intend to eat an apple.
What you want/intend to eat is still in the accusative case: only the wished/intended
action is expressed in the infinitive form. Since the infinitive form is the form listed
in dictionaries, that’s not complicated at all.
Colloquially, there’s another verb that’s often used to express intentions:
misliti (+ inf) (colloq.!) intend
This verb literally means think, but with infinitives, it can be used like this:
Mislimo ići na plažuA. (colloq.!) We intend to go to the beach.
There’s nothing special about the past tense, just use the verb in the past instead of
present, the other verb stays in inf:
Željela sam jesti jabukuA. I wanted to eat an apple. (I = female)
Morao sam jesti jabukuA. I had to eat an apple. (I = male)
Now, if you intend to accomplish something, you should use a perfective verb in inf:
Želim pojesti jabukuA. I want to eat an apple. (the whole apple)
Želim pročitati knjiguA. I want to read the book. (the whole book)
Želim pročitati prvo poglavljeA. I want to read the first chapter. (the whole chapter)
Of course, if you don’t intend to read the whole book, or any defined part of it (like,
a chapter) but just engage in that activity, use the imperfective verb:
Želim čitati knjiguA. I want to read the book. (a bit of it)
Therefore, use of perfective or imperfective verbs makes such statements much
more precise in Croatian. With some actions, perfective verbs are basically always
used, such as:

kupovati (kupuje) ~ kupiti buy
For example:
Moram kupiti novu majicuA. I have to buy a new T-shirt.
It’s unlikely that you want to engage in buying, but not really buy a new T-shirt.
In the Standard Croatian, the infinitive always ends in -i. Colloquially, the final -i of
infinitives is very often left out, even in writing:
Želim jest jabukuA. (colloq.)
Moram pit voduA. (colloq.)
Please pay attention how the English verb must behaves a bit differently than the
other two – it does not use to. English has a special group of ‘modal’ verbs that have
specific behavior – for example, it’s not he musts, but he must. Croatian has no
special modal verbs, the verbs above are like any others, except they permit another
verb in the infinitive as their ‘object’.
Warning. If the verb in inf has a pronoun as its object, it goes to the second
position (unless you use stressed forms, which will be explained a bit later):
Želim teA vidjeti. I want to see you. (!)
Here the pronoun te² (ti in A) is the object of the verb vidjeti see, and not of the
verb željeti want! (Verbs in inf cannot have subjects, so te² cannot be its subject.)
If you would mistakenly translate the last sentence word-for-word, you would
get:
(wrong translation!) I want you to see.
This is an example where the word order in Croatian is completely different than
in English, and it simply doesn’t carry the meaning English order does. (How to
express I want you to see will be explained in 56 Desires and Demands. If you’re
impatient, it’s želim da vidiš.) Check also the past tense:
Željela teA je vidjeti. She wanted to see you. (!)
You’ll sometimes see another construction, which uses verb + da + verb in the
present tense, both verbs in the same person. In such a construction, the word da
restarts word-counting and holds the first position:
Želim da jedem jabukuA. I want to eat an apple.
Želim da teA vidim. I want to see you.
Such constructions are more common in eastern parts of Croatia, but you will
encounter them in songs and literature as well.®
Of course, verbs like trebati can used simply with an object, but it corresponds to
English need, and when it’s used with another verb in infinitive ®, it’s like English

There are two verbs that are not listed above, since they are irregular and need an
additional explanation. They are:

pres-3
pres-1
pres-1pl
pres-3pl
htjeti want
hoće
hoću
hoćemo
hoće
moći can
može
mogu
možemo

The only surprising forms in present of these two verbs are pres-1 and pres-3pl
(check how their pres-1pl is completely expected, given the pres-3). It ends in -u for
both verbs, but the form is also otherwise irregular and must be remembered.
However, the pres-1 form of the verb moći can keeps its stress after the negation,
while all other forms – including the pres-3pl – shift the stress to negation in the
Standard scheme. (I’ve warned you that the Standard scheme is really complex, even
after I have watered it down!)
In some regions, in colloquial speech, present forms of htjeti are without the initial
h-, that is, oću, oćeš, etc. You will see it from time to time in casual writing and
popular songs.
Their past forms are expected for htjeti – like for other verbs in -jeti, e.g. vidjeti see
– but irregular for moći:
htjeti → htio, htjela
moći → mogao, mogla
(You’ll also occasionally see past-m htjeo.) ®
Both verbs are used like the others listed above:
Hoću jesti jabukuA. I want to eat an apple.
Mogu jesti jabukuA. I can eat an apple.
Možemo spavati. We can sleep.
Mogla sam jesti jabukuA. I could eat an apple. (I=female)
However, the verb htjeti is considered a bit rude and impolite; željeti is a better
choice.
The verb moći is equivalent to both English can and may in everyday use. If you
would give someone a permission to do something, you would use moći.
Warning. In English, can has almost empty meaning with some verbs, like see,
hear, feel, taste (generally, ‘sense’ verbs):
I can see you. = I see you.
Croatian never uses moći in this way, for something really happening. If you play
hide and seek and see someone, you would say only:

way to ask for food and drink — but also to offer it to someone, e.g. your guests.
You can hear it in shops, cafes, at home, everywhere – conversations like this one
are very common:
Može čajN? (colloq.) Want some tea? (lit. ‘Is tea OK?’)
— Može. (colloq.) Yes. (lit. ‘OK.’)
Pay attention that the word after može is in nominative. This expression is used both
for asking for something (e.g. by a customer) and offering something (e.g. by a
waiter or host):
Može kavaN? (colloq.) ®
  Want some coffee?
Can I/we get some coffee?
In both cases, an affirmative answer could be just može. However, keep in mind that
this is colloquial, people are not using it in very formal occasions.
If you want to express that you don’t want to eat an apple, just use a normal
negation, except for the verb htjeti want that has special negated present forms
where ho- is replaced with ne- (it’s similar to the verb imati have):
Neću jesti jabukuA. I don’t want to eat an apple.
(You’ll occasionally see negative present forms of htjeti want spelled as separate
words, e.g. ne ću.)
There’s another useful verb that’s often used negated:
smjeti (smije, smio, smjela) be allowed to ®
This verb corresponds to English may, and like it, it’s not really used in speech.
However, it is used in Croatian in negative sentences. This is how it and the other
verbs work when negated:
Ne želim jesti jabukuA. I don’t want to eat an apple.
Ne moram jesti jabukuA. I don’t have to eat an apple.
Ne mogu jesti jabukuA. I cannot eat an apple.
Ne smijem jesti jabukuA. I’m not allowed to eat an apple.
Pay attention that ne¨ + morati does not mean “must not” but “don’t have to”. If
you know some German, you’ll immediately see that it’s similar to German müssen.
This table summarizes various possibilities:

ne + smjeti ®
I must not eat.
I should not eat.
Ne smijem jesti.

ne + morati
I don’t have to eat.
Ne moram jesti.
There are more similarities with German. If you use the verbs above + ići go +
destination, in the spoken language, you can leave the infinitive ići out:
Moram ići na sastanakA. I have to go to a meeting.
Moram na sastanakA. (the same meaning, a bit colloquial)
There’s another verb that similar to pokušavati («) try:
probati (+ inf / A) perf. try
The difference is that this verb basically means try something, e.g. try a shirt on,
taste food, while its use with infinitives is a bit colloquial:
AnaN je probala hlačeA. Ana tried the pants on.
GoranN je probao kolačA. Goran tasted the cake.
You should pay attention that the verb probati perf. try is a perfective verb, so it’s
normally not used in the present tense.®
On the other hand, pokušavati («) cannot be used with objects in A at all – with a
partial exception of pronouns like to.
This table summarizes which verbs can be used with what objects:
+ inf
+ A / inf
moći (...) can
morati must
namjeravati («) intend
pokušavati («) try
smjeti (...) may
htjeti (...) want
planirati («) plan
probati perf. try
trebati need/should
željeti (...) wish
Now, it is possible to replace infinitives (and other things attached to them) with the
general pronoun to, to refer to something previously said or known, so the pronoun
to can be used, and is frequently used with verbs in the left column as well:
Ne mogu toA. I can’t do that.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 38 Needs, Wishes and Inten!ons
224 / 600

moći pres-1
htjeti pres-2
However, it’s common to use the verb raditi besides to, in its generic sense (do):
Ne mogu to raditi. (the same meaning)
The verb trebati is often used impersonally, when used with another verb in inf. It
corresponds to using English generic words like one and men/people:
Treba° jesti zdravo. One should eat healthy.
Of course, as with all impersonal expressions, the verb will be in neuter singular in
the past: trebalo je...
What about intending/having to do something that in Croatian must use a verb with
a se²? You still must use the se², and place it at the second place in the sentence:
GoranN se želi igrati. Goran wants to play.
Moram se brijati. I have to shave.
There’s nothing special about questions – these verbs behave like any other verb, for
instance:
Hoćeš li gledati filmA? Do you want to watch the movie?
ŠtoA želiš jesti? What do you want to eat?
— PizzuA. A pizza.
You can ask about desired actions using što – and answer with verbs in inf (+ objects,
if needed):
ŠtoA želiš? What do you want?
— Jesti pizzuA. ‘Eat pizza.’
If you want to stress that the question is about an action, not a desired object, use
the verb raditi work/do:
ŠtoA želiš raditi? What do you want to do?
— Igrati se. ‘Play.’
There’s one more possibility to express wishes and intentions, using nouns. The
common nouns used for this purpose are:
namjera intention
obaveza obligation
plan plan
potreba need
pravo right
želja wish
They are used as verbs above, what you wish/intend/need is expressed with a verb
in infinitive following the noun:
AnaN ima potrebuA spavati. Ana has a need to sleep.
If the verb in infinitive has a se², it usually follows the verb, but can be also placed
elsewhere, usual placement rules don’t hold:
GoranN ima namjeruA igrati se. ‘Goran has an intention to play.’

jesti
This way of expressing needs and intentions is seen more often in formal
communication, and sometimes in speech when you want to say something
expressive.
However, it’s not really polite to say simply želim + A to someone you’re not familiar
with. Consequently, there’s a way to ‘soften’ such expressions, and you’ll see it in
the following chapter.
________
® In Serbia, infinitives are less often used: in speech, the form da + present prevails
almost completely. For instance, the first sentence in Serbia would rather be
basically always Želim da jedem jabuku. You will sometimes hear such
constructions in Croatia and Bosnia as well.
Furthermore, Standard Serbian insists that the verb trebati cannot be used
personally at all with another verb, so instead of e.g. Trebam jesti jabuke, the only
standard option is:
Treba° da jedem jabukeA.
The past-m form htjeo is frequent in Bosnia.
Instead of kava, a slightly different word kafa is common in most parts of Bosnia
and Serbia. In Bosnia, the form kahva is used as well, especially in parts where
Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) live.
In Serbia, the verb smjeti (smije, smio, smjela) be allowed to is used in the “Ekavian”
form, which is just smeti; the verb is fully regular, but like “Ekavian” razumeti
understand, its pres-3 is smeju. Besides, it has an additional meaning dare.
In Serbia, it’s common to use the verb probati in the present tense as well, unlike in
Bosnia or Croatia.

The song Odjednom ti Suddenly You, performed by Massimo and Merita’s (again

in the I case, both in singular and plural, all used as tools.

The adjective neki is here used as an indicator of indefiniteness. There’s no
possessive adjective in Croatian verses for srce heart; it’s obvious whom it belongs
(but it could have been expressed as well).
The verb reći say is another perfective verb. It’s also quite irregular, and it will be
explained in later chapters.

39 Would, Could: Conditionals
In Croatian, there is a special verb construction called conditional ®. It represents
desires or things that might happen. For instance, phrases I would... (or you could)
are often represented by conditionals in Croatian.
Conditional is a compound form: it’s constructed from the past form, and a special
conditional verb, having with the following forms:
person
sing.
plur.
1st
bih²
bismo²
2nd
bi²
biste²
3rd
bi²
In everyday speech of many people, just bi² is used in all persons and numbers, but
it’s not standard. Just bi² is also quite frequent in casual writing – these are results
by Google™ on the .hr domain:
form
  hits
"mi bismo"
46800
"mi bi"
71000
Let’s compare the following sentences in present:
Jedem. I am eating.
Mogu jesti. I can eat. ®
With ones in conditional (as indicated by the superscript ², the conditional verb
wants to be at the second position):
Jeo bih. I would (like to) eat.
Mogla bih jesti. I could eat. (female speaking) ®
The English I could eat is ambiguous: it could mean that you had the ability in the
past, or that you’re thinking about it right now (conditional). Croatian does not have
such an ambiguity:
Mogla bih jesti. (now, conditional)
Mogla sam jesti. (past)
Croatian mogla bih actually corresponds to English I would be able to.
People use conditionals a lot when trying to be polite or soften expressions, but it
could be ironic as well:
Hoću jesti. I want to eat. (not polite)
Htio bih jesti. (much more polite)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 39 Would, Could: Condi!onals
229 / 600

moći past-f

Another example:
Želim kupiti majicuA. I want to buy a T-shirt. (not polite)
Želio bih kupiti majicuA. (much more polite)
Kupio bih majicuA. (also polite)
Actually, most often desires are expressed using conditionals (these are examples
for the masc. gender in 1st person – I hope you are able to work out others):
Volio bih...  
Htio bih...
Želio bih...
 
  I’d like...
As you see, the verb voljeti (voli,...) love shifts its meaning in conditional a bit –
there’s no real difference in meaning of the three verbs above in conditional. (I’ll
explain various ways to use the verb voljeti (voli,...) love in conditional in 56 Desires
and Demands.)
When the verb trebati need is put into conditional and used with another verb in
infinitive, it’s just a bit softened, and usually means should:
Trebala bih spavati. I should sleep. ®
Trebala bi spavati. You should sleep. (or She should...)
It’s possible to soften any verb with conditional:
Morao bih jesti. I would have to eat.
Sometimes, the conditional verb is used just like a regular verb, for every desire, not
just with verbs (it’s quite informal, children mostly talk like that):
JaN bih čokoladuA. (colloq.) ‘I’d a chocolate.’ = I’d like a chocolate.
What if we have more than one second-position word? Then the conditional verb is
placed before everything else that also requires the second place (that is, words like
me², se², etc.):
IvanN bi meA trebao zvati. Ivan should call me.
GoranN bi se igrao. Ivan would like to play.
If you want to express negative conditional, just place a ne¨ in front of the
conditional verb. These two words must then stay together and are usually found
right before the past form:
Ne bih mogla jesti. I couldn’t eat.
Ivan meA ne bi trebao zvati. Ivan shouldn’t call me.
Goran se ne bi igrao. Ivan wouldn’t like to play.
The negation with the conditional verb behaves like one word that can be placed
anywhere, despite being spelled as two words. Since the conditional verb is short
(one syllable) the stress shifts to ne¨ even in the ‘western’ stress scheme (as
indicated by the underlines above). As a result, you’ll sometimes see (non-standard)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 39 Would, Could: Condi!onals
230 / 600

htjeti pres-2
moći pres-1 | jesti
spellings nebi and like.
To make questions in conditional, just use the normal methods. When the
conditional verb is used in questions, it can be placed at the first position.
Conditional is frequently used in short negative responses, when someone is asked if
he or she wants to do something:
Hoćeš u kinoA? Do you want to go to the cinema? ®
— Ne bih, hvala. I wouldn’t, thanks.
There’s a construction in Croatian that corresponds to the English preference
construction:
cond + radije ... nego ... would rather ... than ...
Both parts – after radije and nego are in conditional, but the conditional verb is not
repeated in the second part. The word radije can be shuffled around a bit, but nego
cannot:
Radije bih čitao knjiguA nego gledao televizijuA. I’d rather read a book than watch
TV.
Pay attention how the verb after nego is also in past forms: both parts are in
conditional, just the second bih is left out.
In both Croatian and English, the verb in the second part is left out if it’s repeated,
however, you have to pay attention to use the right case in Croatian:
Radije bih pio čajA nego kavuA. I’d rather drink tea than coffee. ®
You can even leave the verb completely if you would like to get something:
Radije bih čajA nego kavuA.
This is also often used in short responses:
Želiš li kavuA? Do you want coffee?
— Radije bih čajA. I’d prefer tea.
Conditionals are also used in special, conditional sentences, corresponding to English
"if I were... I would". They are described in 70 If I Were: Conditional Sentences.
(There’s another form, so-called past conditional, but it’s very rare in everyday
communication. It will be covered in 99 Aorist Tense and Other Marginal Features.)
________
® In Serbian grammars, the conditional is often called potential. The forms are the
same.
Instead of infinitives, in Serbia, especially in speech, da + present prevails, so
examples would usually look like:
Mogu da jedem. I can eat.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 39 Would, Could: Condi!onals
231 / 600

moći past-f | jesti
Mogla bih da jedem. I could eat. (female speaking)
Standard Serbian insists that the verb trebati need/should must be used impersonally
with another verb, so the standard option in Serbia is only:
Trebalo bi da spavam. lit. ‘It’s needed that I sleep.’ = I should sleep.
However, in the real speech there’s much more freedom.
Instead of kino and kava, the words bioskop and kafa are used in Serbia and most
of Bosnia for cinema and coffee.

40 Future Tense
We have learned how to make the present tense. We also know how to make the
past tense. But what about the future tense? It’s quite easy to make in Croatian.
First you need the infinitive form of the verb you want to use. That’s really easy,
since infinitive forms are found in any dictionary.
Next, you need forms of an auxiliary verb that’s simply made from present of the
verb htjeti (hoće +, htio, htjela) want by dropping the first syllable (ho). It requires
placement at the second position and looks like this:
pers.
sing.
plur.
1st
ću²
ćemo²
2nd
ćeš²
ćete²
3rd
će²
će²
For example:
GoranN će jesti. Goran will eat.
There’s a rather strange rule: if an infinitive on -ti is followed immediately by an
future auxiliary (ću², ćeš², etc.) the final -i in the infinitive is dropped:
Jest ću. I’ll eat. ®
This of course also applies to the verb biti (je² +) be:
Bit će hladno. It will be cold.
This doesn’t apply to verbs having infinitives ending in -ći:
Ići ćemo u školuA. We’ll go to school.
Colloquially, it’s quite common to leave out -i from the infinitive -ti always, so you’ll
hear quite often:
GoranN će jest. (colloq.) Goran will eat.
(You’ll also often see, mostly in casual writing, non-standard spellings where the
final -i is not dropped, e.g. biti ću, and so on.)
As all other verbal second-position forms – the only exception being je² – all the
forms ću², ćeš², će²... come before any second-position pronouns:
Bit će tiDL hladno. You’ll be cold.
Čut ćemo se. ‘We’ll hear each other.’ (i.e. We’ll be in touch over phone.)
The form će² is ambiguous – it doesn’t distinguish singular and plural:
Vidjet će meA. He/She/They will see me.
Of course, you can always add a subject pronoun if the meaning is not clear from
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 40 Future Tense
233 / 600

ići
ići
the context.
To express negation, use simply negative present forms of the verb htjeti, obtained
by adding ne- to the ću², ćeš², etc. The negative forms are not restricted to the
second position, they are rather placed before the verb in infinitive:
Neću jesti. I won’t eat.
Nećemo ići u školuA. We won’t go to school.
To ask questions about the future, you can use all usual ways to form questions. The
standard way of forming yes/no questions requires full forms of the auxiliary verb,
that is, putting back the ho:
Hoćemo li ići u školuA? Will we go to school?
In colloquial speech, it’s possible to shorten the present of htjeti (hoću, hoćeš, etc.)
to just ću², ćeš²... to express that you want to get something right away:
JaN ću pizzuA. (colloq.) I’ll take a pizza.
The negative existential construction – which is nema + G in the present tense – uses
the verb biti (je² +) be in the future tense instead (as in the past tense):
Neće biti pivaG. There will be no beer.
There’s one more way of expressing future: with the verb ići (ide, išao, išla) go (in
the present tense) + infinitive:
Idem prati zubeA. I’ll ‘wash’ my teeth right now. (= brush)
(In Croatian, teeth are ‘washed’, not ‘brushed’.) Such expressions can only be used if
somebody is willingly and immediately intending to take an action: the very next
thing that person intends to do is grabbing a toothbrush.
This is completely different from the English ‘going-to’ future, which can be used in
e.g. it’s going to rain (as a prediction). Such predictions in Croatian can be expressed
only with the plain ću², ćeš²... future:
Padat će kišaN. It’s going to rain.
It’s also possible to use this kind of future tense in Croatian to suggest people what
to do right now:
Idemo piti pivoA. Let’s have beer now.
As you can see, the Croatian sentence has a completely different structure than the
English one. Translating it word-for-word – we’re going to drink beer – misses its
meaning completely.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 40 Future Tense
234 / 600

2
Another frequent use of the future tense is expressing things that will be done at
unspecified time, e.g. when the following time adverbs are used:
jednog dana one day
jednom once
kasnije 
poslije
   later
(The adverb poslije is a bit colloquial, when used on its own; the ending -ije in it is
usually pronounced as one syllable.) For example:
Reći ću tiDL kasnije. I’ll tell you later.
Here the verb reći (...) is a perfective verb meaning say, tell. Perfective verbs are
common in the future tense, if you want to accomplish something:
Sutra ću kupiti knjigeA. I’ll buy the books tomorrow.
But if you want to engage in an activity, and don’t focus on any particular
accomplishment, you should use an imperfective verb:
Sutra ću kupovati knjigeA. I’ll be buying books tomorrow.
Now, something unexpected. There’s a very special verb, although it has completely
regular forms. It’s an alternative to the verb biti (je² +) be. It has only present forms,
and its pres-3 is:
(bude) be (potential, ‘subjunctive’)
It’s impossible to translate it to English out of context; it’s often translated with get,
become, etc. and it’s (in the Standard Croatian) mostly used in some special
constructions (don’t worry, we’ll learn them soon). The verb (bude) is kind of
perfective; however, it’s not normally used in past or future tense, unlike other
perfective verbs, but it can be used in the present tense when we talk about things
that happen any time:
Često bude hladno ujutro. It’s often cold in the morning. (or It often gets cold...)
Therefore, Croatian has two forms of the present tense of verb biti: the irregular je²
standing for real states and events, and the regular bude used only in special cases
where it stands for potential, possible or desired states.®
Using this special verb, we can simply replace the forms of auxiliary je² in the past
tense with the forms of bude and create another tense – the potential future tense:
past tense
sam², si², je²...
+ past form
potential future
budem, budeš, bude...
+ past form
In the Standard Croatian, you cannot simply use the potential future tense or the
verb (bude): it can be used only in specific constructions.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 40 Future Tense
235 / 600

ići past-mpl
jesti
In fact, there are some constructions in Croatian where you have to use the verb
(bude). They will be introduced a bit later.
In colloquial speech, especially in northwestern Croatia, including Zagreb, both are
often used in ordinary sentences, interchangeably with the standard future forms.
Then the verb (bude) is simply understood as the future form of the verb biti be. So
you will often hear (and sometimes read):
Budemo išli u školuA. (colloq. NW Croatia) We’ll go to school.
This is by no means standard, and such use is restricted to just a part of Croatia
(arguably, with about a half of the total population of Croatia).
One final remark: the potential future tense is usually, in textbooks, known as the
‘exact’ future tense or future II. I think these are quite confusing names, so I’ve
invented another name which makes more sense to me.
________
® You will sometimes see in Bosnia, occasionally in casual writing in Croatia, and
always in Serbia, that in such a case, these two words are spelled fused together and
the t is left out; verbs that end in -sti in infinitive change the consonant s → š:
Biće hladno. It will be cold.
Ješću. I’ll eat. (← jest + ću)
However, this is merely a (weird) spelling. Word order rules still apply, of course, so,
effectively, Serbian words like biće and ješću are limited to the first position in the
sentence!
It never happens anywhere (at least in standard languages!) to verbs having
infinitives in -ći.
Additionally, it’s very common in Serbia, usually in speech, to use da + present tense
instead of the infinitive:
AnaN će da jede. Ana will eat.
While the same forms of the verbs biti and (bude) are used in Serbia, Serbian
grammars traditionally classify bude as the present tense of biti, and present tense
forms (je²) as another verb (referred by the form jesam), having no infinitive.
While it’s true that bude-forms sometimes replace je²-forms, regarding je² as a verb
different than biti is just absurd. Unfortunately, some materials for foreigners on the
Internet repeat this bizarre approach.
A likely background for such approach is that when da + present tense is used
instead of the infinitive biti, bude is used instead of je²:
AnaN će da bude gladnaN. Ana will be hungry.
You’ll later see the exact circumstances when bude-forms replace je²-forms.

41 Somewhere, Nobody, Everything...
There are couple of very useful words – usually called indefinite pronouns – that
generally derive from question-words by adding a ne-. They don’t mean negation,
but some-:
nekamo somewhere (destination)
negdje somewhere (location)
odnekud from somewhere (origin)
These words are used as generic locations, destinations or origins:
AutoN je negdje. The car is somewhere.
The next two indefinite pronouns change in the same way as the question-words
tko who and što what (introduced in 28 Asking Who and What):
netko someone
nešto something
Both pronouns behave grammatically as the pronouns they’re derived from, that is,
netko as masc. sing., nešto as neut. sing.:
NetkoN je bio tamo. Someone was there.
NeštoN je bilo tamo. Something was there.
NetkoN spava. Someone is sleeping.
However, if you want to express just the opposite, that is, nobody is sleeping, in
Croatian, you have only one option: you have to use negation (that is, the verb must
be put to negative), and you must negate the pronoun as well. Croatian uses double
negation as a rule:
NitkoN ne spava. Nobody is sleeping.
It’s very simple to make negative forms of indefinite pronouns: if they begin with
ne-, change it to ni-. Unfortunately, there’s an irregularity: when ni- is prefixed to
što, the result is ništa:
Nemam ništaA. I don’t have anything. (lit. ‘I don’t have nothing.’)
There’s an often used phrase, used when you look you might be hurt, but you aren’t
(or just pretend you aren't):
Nije° miDL ništaN. I’m fine. (lit. ‘It’s nothing to me.’)
Of course, instead of mi², you can use any noun or pronoun in the DL case. Since
ništa is really the subject, it behaves like što, therefore 3rd pers. neut. sing. is used in
the past tense:
Nije jojDL bilo ništaN. She was fine.
To negate adverb-like indefinite pronouns, again replace ne- with ni-, moving it to
the beginning of the word:

Again, all these ni-words require negation of the verb as well:
Nikamo ne idem. I’m not going anywhere. (lit. ‘I don’t go nowhere.’)
To ask questions, it’s normal in Croatian to use the same pronouns as in usual
sentences:
Je li meA netkoN tražio? Was anyone looking for me?
Je li negdje jeftinije? Is anywhere cheaper?
However, in writing, sometimes in formal speech, instead of indefinite pronouns in
such questions, questions pronouns can be used, with indefinite meaning:
Je li meA tkoN tražio? (the same meaning as above)
Je li gdje jeftinije?
Actually, Standard Croatian prefers such use – sentences like je li me netko... are
considered colloquial in Standard Croatian!
Then, there are frequent combinations like somebody else, somewhere else, etc.
Croatian uses specific else-words (meaning other, elsewhere etc. when used on their
own) that must match the first word. Either both change in case, or neither one:
netko drugi somebody else → A nekog drugog
nešto drugo something else → I nečim drugim
negdje drugdje somewhere else (both words are adverbs)
Another type of indefinite pronouns is obtained by prefixing sva- (svu- for some
words), usually in meaning every. Again sva- + što = svašta:
svatko everyone
svašta things of all kinds
The pronoun svašta doesn’t mean everything! For example:
Vidjeli smo svaštaA. We saw many different things.
The word svašta can also have negative implications, as all kind of (bad, strange)
things, depending on the context. It can also be used as a short comment, when
something is unexpected, illogical or meaningless.
Adverbs of this type are:
svakako in any case
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 41 Somewhere, Nobody, Everything...
239 / 600

držati
zvati
1
svugdje everywhere
The adjectives is:
svaki every, each
The adjective svaki is quite often used. For instance:
Svaka sobaN ima dva kreveta24. Each room has two beds.
Držim čašuA u svakoj ruciDL. I’m holding a glass in each hand.
Finally, there’s a rather interesting adjective sav (sv- +) all. It has a bit specific
endings in singular – as if it ends in a Croatian-specific consonant; it also has
obligatory final vowels in endings for masc./neut. singular (normally optional for
most adjectives):
gender
 N
 A
 DL
 G
 I
feminine
sva
svu
svoj
sve
svom
neuter
sve
= N
svemu
svega
svim
m. (not p/a) sav
= N
m. (p/a)
= G
As with other adjectives or pronouns having specific forms, the forms for fem.
gender are just plain forms, listed just for completeness sake. Also, like most other
adjectives with special uses, it never has the optional -i in masc. N.
The adjective can be used as any other adjective, mostly in plural, due to its
meaning:
Zovem sve moje prijateljeA. I’m calling all my friends.
However, the main use of this adjective is as a pronoun, and specific forms have
specific uses. Neuter singular forms (NA sve, DL svemu...) mean everything:
Vidio sam sveA. (A) I saw everything.
Dosta miDL je° svegaG. (G) I had enough of everything.
The second sentence is a frequent Croatian phrase (type it into Google™).
Masculine plural forms (N svi, A sve...) are used in generic sense everybody:
SviN su kod AneG. Everybody is at Ana’s place.
You have to be careful that svi is plural, so when used as the subject, verbs come in
plural too, unlike English:
SviN spavaju. Everybody is sleeping.
Bear in mind that adjectives – sav (sv-) is essentially an adjective – get an additional
-a in DLI-pl when used on their own, as nouns or pronouns. Therefore:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 41 Somewhere, Nobody, Everything...
240 / 600

prijeći past-m
Hvala svimaDL. Thanks to everyone.
Razgovarao sam sa svimaI. I talked to everyone.
The first phrase, hvala svima, is the preferred way to thank a group of people.
Of course, when sav (sv-) is used as an adjective, it gets ordinary endings in DLI-pl:
Hvala svim mojim prijateljimaDL. Thanks to all my friends.
Sometimes, feminine plural forms (N sve, A sve...) are used if you refer to women
only. You will sometimes hear (and read) forms with regular endings (svo, etc.) –
however, only when it’s used as an adjective – such forms are not standard, but
frequent in some regions, especially outside Croatia.
You will from time to time hear additional version of masc. A-pl: svih (like personal
pronouns, oni → njih). It’s widespread in parts of Croatia, but it’s not standard.
Of course, you can use svi drugi everybody else, etc.
There are more adjectives that are used as pronouns in this way: masc. pl. for
people, neut. sing. for things.
The words svi, nitko are similar to total adverbs (e.g. nikad). As will other such
words, you can loosen them a bit with the help of the adverb skoro almost:
Nemam skoro ništaA. I have almost nothing.
Skoro sviN spavaju. Almost everyone is sleeping.
• Examples
Hladno pivo (Cold beer) is a very popular punk-rock band from Zagreb. They
combine love songs with social commentary. This song, Nije sve tako sivo
Everything isn’t so gray, is a song about a guy just dumped by his girlfriend via a text
message (or SMS):
Zar nakon svegaG
Are you really after everything
JojDL nisi ni pozivaG vrijedanN
Not worth a single call to her
A zbog njeG si prešo
  na 091A
And because of her you’ve switched
  to 091
 
 
Nije sveN tako sivoN
Everything isn’t so gray
Kad imaš s nekimI
When you have someone
Otić na pivoA
To go for a beer
(Mile Kekin)
You can listen to it on YouTube™.
The song is not in the Standard Croatian, but fairly close to it.
The word zar enhances a question. The predicative:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 41 Somewhere, Nobody, Everything...
241 / 600

vrijedan (vrijedn-) (G DL) pred. worth (of G to DL)
Is here used (if you unravel the sentence and add the right pronoun) as:
Ti joj nisi vrijedan ni poziva She thinks you’re not worth a single call
The pronoun joj is in DL – it’s her opinion. The particle ni¨ emphasizes the negation
(you see, Croatian has a lot of ‘emphasizing devices’). It will be explained in 67 Only,
Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion.
The preposition zbog because of requires the genitive case; for more details, check:
50 Because, In Order To, Why: Reasons.
The 091 mentioned in the third verse is a mobile network dialing prefix. He switched
the network for her, and yet she didn’t bother to call, she has just sent a text
message. The word prešo is shortened past form prešao, from the verb preći /
prijeći go across, switch to. The word otić is just infinitive otići leave without the
final -i. Both verbs will be explained in the next chapter.
The last two verses translate literally as ‘when you have with someone to go on
beer’. Words s nekim with someone are just the usual preposition + instrumental
case. As you can see, words in Croatian can be shuffled around a lot.

ići past-m
ući past-m
42 Come In, Come Out, Go
Now I will introduce you to various verbs derived from ići (ide, išao, išla) go.
The verb is irregular in the pres-3 and past forms, and verbs derived from it are also
irregular. They have a wide range of meanings, some of them both a literal meaning
and metaphorical one.
There’s a very important difference compared to English. Take a look at the
following English sentences:
I went into the room.
I came into the room.
I entered the room.
English has a set of verbs (enter, leave, etc.) that are used with simple objects: you
just enter something.
Not so in Croatian: most motion verbs behave as go and don’t use objects, but
rather destinations or locations. For example:
Išao sam u sobuA. I went into the room.
Ušao sam u sobuA. I entered the room.
All verbs are organized into impf. ~ perf. pairs. Actually, all impf. verbs derived in
those pairs are perfectly regular. The two simplest verb pairs are:
dolaziti ~ doći (dođe, došao, došla) come
ulaziti ~ ući (uđe, ušao, ušla) enter, come into
As you can see, these two verb pairs have exactly the same forms, just one pair
starts with do- and another with u-. All verbs derived from ići have exactly the forms
like the verbs above, except for two verbs, so it’s much less to remember than it
seems.
This is a general characteristic of Croatian verbs: they are organized into families,
where all pairs have very similar forms, stress pattern, and usually just different
prefixes. An upside is that you can easily remember all verb pairs at once; a
downside is that you can sometimes mix pairs up.
Let’s put them to use:
Doći ćemo sutra. We’ll come tomorrow.
The stress patterns of verbs depend on the number of syllables in the prefix, e.g.
verbs derived with do- do not have the same pattern as ones derived with iza-.
The following verb deviates from the above pattern:
odlaziti ~ otići (ode, otišao, otišla) leave, depart
It’s a very frequently used verb pair. The impf. verb means depart, leave:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 42 Come In, Come Out, Go
243 / 600

otići past-f
doći past-mpl
otići past-mpl
izaći past-f
Odlazimo na plažuA. We’re leaving for the beach.
This perf. verb is a bit ambiguous. It stands for two things: departure (like the impf.
verb) and completing the whole motion:
Otišla je na plažuA.
 (1) She has left for the beach. (departed)
 (2) She has gone to the beach. (completed)
The meaning #2 is just perfective of ići (...) go: the motion is completed.
On the other hand, do- corresponds to English come/came:
Došli smo na plažuA. We came to the beach.
There are more Croatian verb families that show this opposition. Their pair with ot-
or od- is similar to one described above – a bit ambiguous perf. verb, often being
just perfective of the base verb, and another pair, derived do-, similar to come.
For both pairs, the place you’re going to is expressed as a destination.
When you want to express that you leave some place, you have to use origins (that
is, the right prepositions + G), and not objects:
Otišli smo iz ZagrebaG. We left Zagreb.
This verb pair means only go somewhere or leave a place; there’s another Croatian
verb pair that means go and not take something (e.g. leave the wallet):
ostavljati ~ ostaviti leave (e.g. keys)
For example:
Ostavila sam novčanikA negdje. I left the wallet somewhere. (I = female)
This verb pair is also used when you intentionally leave things, e.g. for someone:
Ostavila sam ručakA za tebeA u frižideruDL. I left the lunch for you in the fridge.
If you know some Spanish, you can see these two Croatian verb pairs correspond to
two Spanish verbs: salir (leaving a place) and dejar (leaving a thing). The same
difference exists in French: partir vs. laisser, and in German: abfahren vs. lassen.
However, French laisser and German lassen have many generic meanings, while
ostavljati ~ ostaviti means only leave things or people.
Another verb also deviates from the above pattern:
izlaziti ~ izaći (izađe, izašao, izašla) come out, exit
It is used in a similar way to odlaziti, but mostly for closed spaces, e.g. rooms,
houses, etc. You have to use origins:
Izašla sam iz sobeG. I came out of the room.
The perf. verb in this pair has also an alternative form, with izi- instead of iza-; it’s

preći past-m

moći pres-1
moći pres-1
actually preferred in Standard Croatian, but less often used in real life (e.g. about 5
times less common on the Internet).
The next three verbs have forms very similar to others. These verbs sound quite
alike, and their meaning is all about moving with respect to something else rather
than the destination or origin of motion. What is special about them is that they can
use prepositions with nouns, but also plain objects in A, without much difference in
meaning. Each verb uses a different preposition:
obilaziti ~ obići (obiđe, obišao, obišla) go around; visit
prelaziti ~ preći (pređe, prešao, prešla) cross, go over *
prolaziti ~ proći (prođe, prošao, prošla) go through; pass
The verb pair starting with pro- is used when you literally pass something; it’s used
with either A or kroz + A:
Prolazim kroz šumuA. I’m passing through the forest.
Prošao sam kroz šumuA. I passed through the forest.
Prošao sam šumuA. I left the forest behind.
As in English, this pair can be used figuratively, then things just pass, i.e. they are
there, and then they are not:
VrijemeN prolazi. Time is passing.
BolN će proći. The pain will pass.
BolN je prošla. The pain has passed. = The pain is gone.
The past form of the perf. verb is used as a real adjective, in the meaning previous,
last:
Prošle godineG sam bila u ZadruDL. I was in Zadar last year.
The verb pair starting with pre- means cross; it can be used with either preko over +
G, or with just with an object in A:
Prešao sam preko mostaG. I crossed over the bridge.
Prešao sam mostA. I crossed the bridge.
Prelazim mostA. I’m crossing the bridge.
The perf. verb in this pair was listed above in a shorter, regularized form, which is
considered non-standard, unfortunately. The standard perf. verb has a bit irregular
infinitive and the present tense forms:
prelaziti ~ prijeći (prijeđe, prešao, prešla) cross, go over
You will encounter both forms in writing, and on the Internet, including newspapers
(Google™ for e.g. preći preko or pređem preko). The verb pair with preko + G is
also used metaphorically, to ignore, dismiss or not discuss something:
Ne mogu prijeći preko togaG. I can’t dismiss it.
Ne mogu preći preko togaG. (the same, but non-standard)

245 / 600

preći past-mpl
obići past-m
obići past-f
prići past-f | 3pl
naći past-m
snaći se past-f
Another use of this verb pair is with na¨ + A, where it means cross to, switch to (as
means), get to, move on to (in conversation):
Prešli smo na drugu temuA. We have moved on to another topic.
The verb pair starting with obi- means go around; one option is to use it with oko
around + G:
Obišao sam oko kućeG. I went around the house.
When used with just an object (in A) it mostly means visit, sight-see:
Obišla sam gradA. I visited (went around) the city.
Another verb pair is very similar to these three, but it’s used with DL (!) only:
prilaziti ~ prići (priđe, prišao, prišla) approach, come close
For example:
Prišla sam imDL. I approached them.
Then, there are three verbs with completely unexpected meaning:
nalaziti ~ naći (nađe, našao, našla) find
pronalaziti ~ pronaći (pronađe, pronašao, pronašla) find, discover
snalaziti se² ~ snaći (snađe, snašao, snašla) se² manage, handle
The verb pair with na- is the main way to express this meaning in Croatian (the impf.
verb nalaziti is not often used). It’s used just with an object in A:
Našao sam ključeveA. I found the keys.
Naći ću ključA. I’ll find the key.
This verb pair is not used in phrases like I find her attractive and I want to find out
about it. It’s only used if you physically ‘find’ some object that was unknown or lost.
The second verb pair, with prona-, has a very similar meaning to the previous one,
but it implies a longer search, and is used also when someone discovers something.
The third verb pair, with sna-, is also a kind of find: it’s used to when you manage
not to get lost, either in a city you visit for the first time, or metaphorically, in
something new you do, when you have to get quickly accustomed to new work,
people, any new or unexpected situation, especially if you do it on your own,
improvising, without assistance:
Nisam se odmah snašla u ZagrebuDL. I didn’t get accustomed to
Zagreb immediately.
The verb pair with na-, when used with se², has meaning located, similar to English is
found or can be found (in this way, the impf. verb is often used):
PivoN se nalazi u frižideruDL. The beer can be found in the fridge.
RješenjaN se nalaze na krajuDL knjigeG. ‘Solutions’ (i.e. answer keys) are found at the
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 42 Come In, Come Out, Go
246 / 600

end of the book.
This combination is used only for physical location, you cannot use it in meaning
‘exist’ e.g. sponges can be found in different sizes – for that, you have to use
postojati (postoji) exist or some other way.
The following verb pair is similar to odlaziti ~ otići (...) but the focus is on starting a
journey.
polaziti ~ poći (pođe, pošao, pošla) depart
These two verbs are not often used, mostly used when talking about trains or buses.

The following verses contain a negative existential expression; jedne večeri is a

of morati must, have to; the second verse has the shortened infinitive proć pass,
which is colloquial, but it rhymes with noć night:

The following verses contain the impf. verb prolaziti pass; note also use of maj for
the month of May. There are many negative existential expressions, some of them

43 And, Or, But: Basic Conjunctions
Croatian has basically two conjunctions that correspond to English and:
i¨
a¨
The conjunction i¨ is used when you want to join two words or two parts of
sentences:
IvanN i AnaN rade. Ivan and Ana are working. (nouns)
AnaN je žednaN i gladnaN. Ivan is thirsty and hungry. (two adjectives)
SobeN su u prizemljuDL i na katuDL. The rooms are on the ground floor and on the
first floor. (two locations)
It’s possible to join two normal-type sentences (that is, two verbs) that have the
same subject:
AnaN jede i pije. Ana is eating and drinking.
[Pijem čajA] i [čitam knjiguA]. I’m drinking tea and reading a book.
Here we actually join two clauses; a clause is kind of sentence-within-a-sentence (I
have put square brackets around each of them in the last sentence).
It’s also possible to join two subjective-experience-type sentences, if they have the
same experiencer (in DL):
Hladno miDL je i dosadno. I’m cold and bored.
However, if you want to join two sentences that have different subjects (and usually
verbs too), you have to use the conjunction a¨:
AnaN čita knjiguA, a GoranN spava. Ana is reading a book, and Goran is sleeping.
When an a¨ is used, a comma always separates two clauses.
Now there’s a very interesting rule. If you have different subjects – and
consequently use a¨ – the subjects must be emphasized. That is, you have to use
them:
AnaN čita knjiguA, a jaN spavam. Ana is reading a book, and I’m sleeping.
You cannot use the previous sentence with just a spavam!
The same works for experiencers: they must be emphasized, that is, stressed forms
of pronouns must be used:
AnaN se zabavlja, a meniDL je dosadno. Ana is having fun, and I’m bored.
Again, you cannot use the previous sentence with just a dosadno mi je! Also, such
emphasized subjects are usually the in the leftmost position.
The conjunction a¨ is also used if there’s some opposition between two clauses, e.g.
Zabavljam se, a trebao bih učiti. I’m having fun, and I should study.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 43 And, Or, But: Basic Conjunc!ons
250 / 600

1
htjeti pres-1
ići past-mpl
In such a case, when the subjects are the same in both clauses – as above – they are
not emphasized.
As other words marked with ¨, words i¨ and a¨ don’t count – second position words
cannot be placed after them:
AnaN je čitala knjiguA, a jaN sam² spavao. Ana was reading a book, and I was
sleeping.
Gledam filmA i dosadno miDL² je². I’m watching a movie, and I’m bored.
An exception to the “rule of different subjects” is when the second clause is a
consequence of the first, then the emphasis of the subject of first clause is not
needed, and i¨ is used:
Pokucao sam i onaN je otvorila vrataA. I knocked and she opened the door.
Another example of this exception are weather phenomena: if everything is as
expected, use i¨, while a¨ is reserved for unusual and unexpected things, i.e. not
consequences:
ZimaN je i pada snijegN. It’s winter and it’s snowing.
LjetoN je, a hladno je. It’s summer, and/but it’s cold.
The next conjunction – ili – is very similar to English or:
ToN je patkaN ili guskaN. That’s a duck or a goose.
Unlike i¨ or a¨, ili is a word that counts, and all second-position words come right
after it.
When you have two subjects or objects (not necessarily in A) which you would link
with and in a negative sentence, you can use ni¨ instead of i¨ to either emphasize
negation, or when there’s no real connection between these two things:
Nemamo uljaG ni octaG. We have no oil and no vinegar.
This is always optional.
The conjunction ali usually corresponds to English but:
Hoću se tuširati, ali nema tople vodeG. I want to have a shower, but
there’s no hot water.
Again, when an ali is used, a comma always separates two clauses. The major
difference in comparison to a¨ is that ali is a word that counts, and all second-
position words come right after it.
Unfortunately, but is not always ali: there’s an interesting conjunction nego, which
kind of completely corrects what was said, but what was said must be negative. For
example:
Nismo išli u kinoA, nego u restoranA. We didn’t go to the cinema, but to
a restaurant.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 43 And, Or, But: Basic Conjunc!ons
251 / 600

This construction is more common in writing, a bit less in speech. The important
thing is that Croatian ali cannot be used in this construction. The same difference
exists in German and Spanish, which has been always a bit of a problem for native
English speakers:
English
      but
Croatian
ali
nego
German
aber
sondern
Spanish
pero
sino
While ali connects two clauses, with nego you don’t have to repeat anything from
the part before it, just state the ‘correction’ (of course, you can repeat the verb if
you want to).
However, there are cases when you can and must use ali (and Spanish pero) – when
you don’t completely correct what is said, but talk about an exception:
Ne volim serijeA, ali miDL se sviđa WestworldN. I don’t like (TV) series, but I like
the Westworld.
(Note how Croatian uses different verbs here; you could use voljeti (...) in both parts
too.)
Another example is a complete correction vs something just unexpected or
uncommon:
JanetN nije iz HrvatskeG, nego iz KanadeG. Janet isn’t from Croatia, but from Canada.
JanetN nije iz HrvatskeG, ali zna hrvatskiA. Janet isn’t from Croatia, but she ‘knows’
Croatian. (i.e. speaks)
If you’re unsure about ali vs nego, there’s a simple test: if you can rephrase the
sentence with instead (e.g. we went to a restaurant instead) or with rather, you
should use nego instead of ali.
There’s a simple way to emphasize that all
subjects/actions/objects/places/whatever are involved, like in English both... and....
In Croatian, simply an i¨ is placed before each emphasized item:
I IvanN i AnaN rade. Both Ivan and Ana are working.
SobeN su i u prizemljuDL i na katuDL. The rooms are both on the ground floor and on
the first floor.
However, if you want to make an emphasis in a sentence where the verb is negated,
you should use negative conjunctions ni¨ instead, but the verb is still negated:
Ni IvanN ni AnaN ne rade. Neither Ivan nor Ana are working.
SobeN nisu ni u prizemljuDL ni na katuDL. The rooms are neither on the ground floor
nor on the first floor.

As you can see, this corresponds to English neither... nor..., but the major difference
is that the verb is negated in Croatian sentences.
To emphasize that only one option is possible, you can use ili... ili..., corresponding
to English either... or:
ToN je ili patkaN ili guskaN. That’s either a duck or a goose.
The following conjunctions are used for time sequences, where one thing happens
after another, usually when the subject is the same, or there’s no subject:
pa
te (bookish)
   and (time sequence)
Both can be replaced with i¨ when linking two parts of a sentence. For example:
Bila sam gladnaN pa sam kupila sendvičA. I was hungry, and/so I bought a sandwich.
Both conjunctions count, i.e. second position words come right after them.
The word pa is also used in conversation, to emphasize that something is almost
obvious, that something need not to be said at all:
ŽedanN sam. I’m thirsty.
— Pa popij malo vodeG! Well, drink some water!
It can be also used on its own, as a small (impatient) rhetorical question:
Pa? Well? / So? / So what?
In this use, pa corresponds to English well, but it’s not used as a “filler word” when
you try to fill a gap in your speech (... well, .... ). As fillers, words znači and dakle are
common.
The word te is a fancy conjunction that’s virtually never used in speech.
• Examples
This song, Najdraže moje Oh my dearest, was a big hit by Novi fosili, the most
popular Croatian pop group in late 1970’s and early 1980’s. The song is still quite
popular.
The song starts with a condition clause, which is not explained yet, but actually quite
simple to understand. The words najdraže moje are in the only case we haven’t
covered yet: the vocative case; it’s used to directly address someone. In that case,
adjectives usually come after nouns. Furthermore, the adjective najdraži dearest is
in the so-called superlative form; it will be covered in 63 Bigger and Better:

  u valimaDL tugeG
  in waves of sorrow
Normally, the plural of val wave would be valovi, but short plural forms are
sometimes used in poetry.
The verses above, and the following verses use several perfective verbs; one of
them is used in the present tense, but in an if construction, i.e. referring to possible
things in the future (such constructions will be explained later, in 70 If I Were:
Conditional Sentences). The pairs are:
gubiti ~ iz- («) lose
utapati («) ~ utopiti («) drown
nastajati (nastaje) ~ nastati (nastane) emerge, come about
The last pair is a member of an important ‘verb family’ which will be explained in 52
Stand, Become, Exist, Cease. The verb ugasnuti (ugasne) perf. go out, die out is very
rare, it’s even missing from some dictionaries.
The following verses use the same pattern. The part ni ptice ni ljudi uses ni... ni...
introduced in this chapter. Furthermore, the phase is in N, which means neither birds
nor people will be able to see. (In my English translation, it’s not clear if nobody can
see birds or what.)

  neither birds, nor people
Kad odem zauvijek

  kad zauvijek odem
  when I leave for good
  najdraže moje...
  oh my dearest...
Note the two lines where just words are in different positions, with a slight emphasis
on zauvijek in the second line (which I could maybe translate as really for good).
The following verses contain nikada više ljubavi nove which is actually the negative
existential nikada više neće biti nove ljubavi. The verb is left out, and the order of
noun and adjective is reversed to make the line sound better and have the same
rhythm as the other lines:
Nikada više
Never again
  ljubavi noveG
  a new love
  najdraže moje
  oh my dearest
TamaN će odnijet
Darkness will take away

(Dea Volarić)
The verb odnijeti (..) perf. take away will be introduced in 65 Carry, Bring, Drive:

Transport Verbs (its forms are quite irregular, so I won’t list them here).
Note the song is not completely in Standard Croatian: -i missing from some
infinitives, and and there is an -i in an infinitive before the future tense auxiliary,
both non-standard.
You can listen to it on YouTube™ (check this cover). Note that the song uses mostly
the western stress – Novi fosili were from Zagreb (e.g. izgubim and not izgubim, the
stress stays on the verb in ne vidi). The word zauvijek is once pronounced as
zauvijek, another time as zauvijek, most likely to conform to the rhythm.

bojati se
44 Genitive Plural
It’s finally the time to learn the genitive case in plural! Unfortunately, it’s not a
simple form to create. For start, nouns get the following endings:
noun type
G-pl
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -a* (or -i)
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) -o, -e → -a*
masc. nouns not in -a
N-pl -i → -a*
fem. not in -a (e.g. noć)
add -i
For example:
GoranN se boji mravaG. Goran is afraid of ants.
As this form coincides with G singular, the sentence could also mean Goran is afraid
of an ant.
In the beginning, I wrote I will disregard vowel length, i.e. differences between long
and short vowels, since many people in Croatia don’t have that difference in their
speech. However, those that keep the difference, and Standard Croatian, have the -
a in G-pl always long – while -a in other case endings is always short – so forms
mrava (G) and mrava (G-pl) are not really pronounced the same. That specific length
in G-pl is sometimes indicated in writing by putting a circumflex sign over the long
vowel: mravâ. It’s by no means mandatory, you will see it from time to time. (A
recent Croatian orthography manual recommends using a macron – a line over
vowel – instead, e.g. mravā; it’s still very rare.)
There are no twists for nouns ending in -a, -o or -e preceded by only one consonant:
nouns just get -a in G-pl.
Other nouns can get a kind of ‘lengthening’ (I indicated it by an asterisk).
How does it work? If a neuter or feminine noun would have two consecutive
consonants just before the genitive plural -a, an additional a gets inserted between
those consonants:
pjesma song → pjesama
sestra sister → sestara
zemlja ground, country → zemalja
carstvo empire → carstava
društvo society → društava
pismo letter → pisama
Some nouns (e.g. sestra sister and zemlja ground, country listed above) move the
stress to the inserted -a-. There’s only a small number of them, and a good
dictionary should list such stress shift.
Observe that before the two final consonants there may be more consonants (e.g.
sestra): they play no role here. Also, pay attention that lj, nj and dž are single
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 44 Geni!ve Plural
256 / 600

consonants.
This insertion never happens if those last two consonants are either st, št, šć, zd, žd
or žđ (so-called non-splittable sequences):
zvijezda star → zvijezda
mjesto place → mjesta
Masculine nouns that get short plural endings, and end in a consonant, get the -a
always attached to their nominative form, even if they have a specific case-base:
kolač cake → kolača
magarac (magarc-) donkey → magaraca
pas (ps-) dog → pasa
vrabac (vrapc-) sparrow → vrabaca
This makes their G-pl form distinct from the singular genitive. For example:
AnaN se bojala pasaG. Ana was afraid of dogs.
AnaN se bojala psaG. Ana was afraid of the dog.
Few masculine nouns that end in two consonants which are not a non-splittable
sequence, get an additional a in the same way as feminine and neuter nouns:
bicikl bicycle → bicikala
koncert concert → koncerata
dokument document → dokumenata
However, masculine nouns that end in a vowel (in N) and get short plural endings,
only add an -a to their case-base, as in any other case (therefore, they have G =
G-pl):
anđeo (anđel-) m angel → anđela
auto (aut-) m car → auta
Some nouns on -a preceded by two or more consonants can have both -a in gen.
plural (with an additional a inserted) and -i. Both are used, but versions with -i
prevail in everyday speech, at least in larger cities in Croatia:
daska plank → dasaka / daski
karta card, map → karata / karti
olovka pen → olovaka / olovki
školjka shell → školjaka / školjki
voćka fruit tree → voćaka / voćki
These nouns can have both -a and -i but they never get an additional a inserted; they
mostly end in -nja; the ending -i is more common in spoken language:
nepravda injustice
pažnja care, attention
prijetnja threat
šetnja walk
The following often used nouns have just -i in G-pl:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 44 Geni!ve Plural
257 / 600

bajka fairy tale
borba struggle
lopta ball
majka mother
maska mask
molba plea
palma palm
petlja loop
plahta bed sheet ®
tajna secret
torba bag, big purse
žalba complaint, appeal
This also applies to a couple of masculine nouns; a frequent example is (recall, it
shifts its stress in plural):
mjesec month/moon → mjeseci
The noun čovjek man/human has the irregular plural ljudi people; its G-pl is also just
ljudi.
The noun sat – when meaning hour – has G-pl sati.
Some nouns get an -u or something similar, instead of the endings listed above.
These three nouns get always -u:
noga leg
ruka arm
sluga m servant
This noun gets -iju:
gost guest → gostiju
The strange plurals of oko eye and uho ear get -iju as well:
oči f pl. eyes → očiju
uši f pl. ears → ušiju
The following nouns can have both -a (or -i) and -iju:
kost f bone → kosti / kostiju
prst finger/toe → prsta / prstiju
nokat (nokt-) fingernail, toenail → nokata / noktiju
vrata n. pl. door → vrata / vratiju
Additionally, the following colloquial noun can get both -i and -iju, but the latter
ending is seen as very colloquial:
dečko (dečk-) m boy → dečki / dečkiju ®
All such unexpected forms in the G-pl are listed in the Core Dictionary.
Compared to all the twists I had to explain for nouns, the genitive plural forms of
adjectives are as simple as possible:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 44 Geni!ve Plural
258 / 600

gender
adj. G-pl
example
fem.
-ih
velikih riba
big fishes
neut.
velikih jezera
big lakes
masc.
velikih stolova 
big tables
The adjective-often-used-as-pronoun sav (sv- +) has an alternative, non-standard
form that’s sometimes seen is G-pl: sviju, besides the expected svih.
We can review endings of adjectives in DL, G and I cases in both singular and plural:
adj.
gender
DL
I
G
sing.
fem.
-oj
-om
-e
neut.
masc.
-om
(-em) -im
-og
(-eg)
plur.
all
   -im(+a)
-ih
As you can see, they are much simpler than they could be in principle.
In the following chapters, we’ll see many uses of G-pl in counting and measuring.
________
® Besides plahta, words čaršav or čaršaf are often used in Bosnia and completely
prevail in Serbia, in meaning thin sheets, while plahta is used for thick covers.
The noun dečko is less common outside Croatia, and it’s not even used in some
Croatian regions; it’s most common in Zagreb and surrounding areas.
• Something Possibly Interesting
Many prescriptive manuals, dictionaries and grammars (i.e. books telling people how
they should speak) demand stress shift left in G-pl in words like:
policajac (policajc-) policeman → policajaca G-pl
Very few people use that stress in G-pl in real life – people say simply policajaca.
Consequently, the stress in G-pl of such words is a matter of dispute in Bosnia and
Serbia, where certain local “linguists” insist on the dictionary stress, which
consequently appears on the Public TV. This is much less debated in Croatia, where
most people don’t care much what dictionaries prescribe.

• Examples
The song Potraži me u predgrađu Look for me in the suburbia is a well-known ‘old
school’ Croatian pop song. It has not too complicated grammar. The form potraži is
not yet explained – it’s called imperative, and it’s used to form commands:
Potraži meA u predgrađuDL
Look for me in the suburbia
Na uliciDL, na raskršćuDL
On the street, in the intersection
Gdje tiDL je jorgovanN rasuo perleA
Where the lilac scattered your beads
Gdje namDL je proljećeN dotaklo usneA
Where the spring touched our lips
  i pobjeglo
  and ran away
The third and fourth line contain possessive DL, one time for perle beads (not
pearls), another time for usne lips. In the last three verses, perfective verbs from
these difficult pairs are used:
rasipati ~ rasuti (raspe, rasuo) scatter
doticati (dotiče) ~ dotaći (dotakne, dotakao, dotakla) touch
bježati (bježi) ~ pobjeći (pobjegne, pobjegao, pobjegla) run away
(You probably see now the case endings are not the most complex feature in
Croatian.)
Note that suburbia – especially at the time the song was written – was the poorer
outer part of cities in Croatia, with narrow, sometimes unpaved streets, and small
houses.
Potraži meA u predgrađuDL
Look for me in the suburbia
Kraj vlakovaG što prolaze
Beside the passing trains
Bit ćemo samiN u svitanjeDL danaG
We’ll be alone in the dawn of the day
Bit ćemo samiN u pjesmamaDL pticaG
We’ll be alone in songs of the birds
  ko nekada
  like long ago
The word kraj means beside when used with a noun in G; the same can be expressed
with pokraj. The construction vlakovi što prolaze means passing trains, literally
trains that are passing. The third and fourth line is of course the future tense. The
word ko is a colloquially shortened form of kao like, as.
The first line uses nouns rublje clothes, underwear and cvijeće flowers: they are so-
called collective nouns – they stand for a whole heap of things, but are in singular
(they will be explained in #47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Counting Children):
Drijemaju jedraN od rubljaG i cvijećaG
Sails of cloth and flowers nap
Čekaju vjetarA da nekuda plove
They wait for the wind to sail somewhere
Čuješ li, našeN nasA predgrađeN zove

Old houses and streets are looking for you

(Drago Britvić)
The second line contains a so-called purpose clause – the part after da, explaining
intentions – which will be explained later. In the third line, naše predgrađe is split by
A nas²; this is kind of strict placement. The last line has an adjective after the noun,
which is not uncommon in poetry.
This song has been popular for five decades so far, and there are many
performances on YouTube™. Check a performance on A strana, a cover from
1980’s, and performances from 1960’s by Lado Leskovar and Đorđe Marjanović
(which is partially “Ekavized”).
The song was composed by – at the time – a little known 21-year-old student of
electrical engineering from Split, a math lover and self-taught composer: Zdenko
Runjić. Over the following 40 years, he composed about 700 tunes, many of them
becoming major hits, today considered classics of Croatian popular music.

45 Quantities and Existence
Quantities (some water, many people) can be expressed in several ways in Croatian.
It’s important to make first a distinction between countable and uncountable nouns:
countable
uncountable
can be both
auto m car
jabuka apple
problem problem
prozor window
Ana (name)
...
kosa hair (on head)
sol f salt ®
sreća luck
vrijeme (vremen-) time
zrak air ®
...
kava coffee ®
kruh bread ®
papir paper
sok juice
voda water
...
In English, you can e.g. use few with countable nouns (few cars) but not with
uncountable ones (no few salt but rather little salt). And you cannot use numbers
with uncountable ones (that’s why they are called so). Finally, there are nouns, such
as water, which can be both countable and uncountable. But let’s look at the
simpler nouns first.
In Croatian, there’s a shortcut: if you want to express some quantity of an
uncountable noun, used as an object, you can use just the noun in the genitive case
(instead of A):
Imam soliG. I have some salt.
If you want to express the same thing, but for countable nouns, you should use the
genitive case in plural:
Imamo jabukaG. (G-pl) We have some apples.
Note how English uses the noun in singular in the first sentence, but the noun in
plural in the second sentence, exactly corresponding to the Croatian forms (except
for the genitive case, of course).
Of course, the verb imati have normally demands A. But using G instead of A is a
shortcut to express few or some of the object. This can be done with other verbs
as well, but it’s common with imati. A lot of meaning in Croatian is expressed
with just tweaking cases!
With nouns of the third type, you can use them in G, but also count them:
Imamo kruhaG. We have some bread. ®
Imamo dva kruha24. I have ‘two breads’. (two loafs of bread)
Imam sokaG. I have some juice.
Molim dva soka24. ‘I’m kindly asking for two juices.’ (Two bottles/glasses of juice,
please.)
As you can see, the meaning changes if you count them – they then refer to some
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 45 Quan!!es and Existence
262 / 600

default ‘package’ of them.
When you use negation of the verb imati have, uncountable objects are normally in
G instead of A – meaning ‘any’:
Nemam vremenaG. (G) I don’t have any time.
On nema srećeG. (G) He has no luck.
You will very, very rarely hear or see A of uncountable nouns with such negative
sentences – just check these results from Google™ (on the .hr domain):
form
    hits
"nemam vremena" (G) 109000
"nemam vrijeme" (A)
154
With some nouns that can be both uncountable and countable, you can use both A
and G in positive and negative sentences, expressing different meanings. The most
common examples are these nouns:
noun
countable
uncountable
mjesto
place
place (as space, room)
posao (posl-) m
job
work
For example:
Imam posaoA. (A) I have a job.
Imam poslaG. (G) I have some work. (i.e. I’m busy.)
Nemam posaoA. (A) I don’t have a job.
The noun mjesto when used as countable, has an additional meaning: inhabited
place.
Even with countable nouns, you can use G-pl in negative sentences to express any:
it’s mostly used for things that are often found in large numbers, and, of course, it’s
optional:
Nemam jabukaG. (G-pl) I don’t have any apples.
Soba nema prozoraG. (G-pl) The room has no windows.
This is virtually never done with things that always come in small numbers or are
individualized (parents, passport, husband, wife, forum avatar, etc.) – the plain old A
is used then.
Next, before nouns in genitive, you can place one of the following adverbs of
quantity:
malo a bit / few
dosta quite a few
premalo too little / few
previše too much / many
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 45 Quan!!es and Existence
263 / 600

3pl
3pl
dovoljno enough
nedovoljno not enough
While English distinguishes few (for countable nouns) vs. little (for uncountable
ones), not such distinction exists in Croatian – you can use the adverbs above for
both – but you still need to pay attention to put countable nouns in G-pl and
uncountable ones in G! Then, there are two words that mean the same:
puno
mnogo  
   much, many, a lot of
The word puno is more colloquial than mnogo. These words can be used with both
countable and uncountable nouns, but the nouns should be in genitive singular (if
uncountable) or plural (if countable):
Imamo premalo kruhaG. (G) We have too little bread.
Imamo puno jabukaG. (G-pl) We have a lot of apples.
Such quantities – if only a genitive is used and if a quantity adverb is used – act as
being neuter singular, so verbs and other words must be set accordingly if such
quantities are used as subjects:
Puno ljudiG je bilo ovdje. A lot of people were here.
This is quite unlike English! You can use personal pronouns instead of nouns (again in
G-pl, there’s no change in grammar of other parts):
Puno ihG je bilo ovdje. A lot of them were here.
As you can see, you can use the short forms of pers. pronouns, but they must be at
the second position. Unlike English, words like puno a lot can be separated from the
nouns and pronouns, without much change in meaning:
Puno je ljudiG ovdje.
Ovdje ihG je puno.
It’s obvious that puno refers to ljudi and ih, since the noun and the pronoun are in
G-pl.
There are two more words, used to for indefinite amounts of countable nouns only;
they behave grammatically exactly as other quantity adverbs:
nekoliko several
par a couple of
For example:
Imamo nekoliko jabukaG. We have several apples.
Par ljudiG je bilo pred kućomI. A couple of people were in front of the house.
(Many Croatian language manuals condemn using par for anything than exactly two,
but, like in English, a couple of can be more than a pair. There’s also a noun par
meaning couple, pair, but these words don’t behave the same; more in the following
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 45 Quan!!es and Existence
264 / 600

f
chapters.)
There’s another word reused to express small and indefinite quantities, like English
some:
nešto some (adverb) ®
The word nešto does not change in case when in this role, and behaves like malo,
but it emphasizes that the quantity is small and not really known. It can be used with
both countable and uncountable nouns:
Imam nešto kaveG. (G) I have some coffee.
Imam nešto limunaG. (G-pl) I have few lemons.
Next, we’re able to express existence of any, usually indefinite amount of something
(e.g. there are some apples). While English uses dummy there, Croatian uses the
verb imati have in the impersonal form (without any subject, in the 3rd person
singular). The nouns are again in G-pl for countable nouns, G-sg for uncountables:
Ima° jabukaG. (G-pl) There are some apples.
Ima° vodeG. (G) There is some water.
Pay attention that countable nouns always use G-pl in any constructions involving
quantities. The only exception is with numbers 2-4, neki and koji.
Since these sentences are impersonal (literally: it has some apples), as with any
impersonal sentence, the past tense forms must be in neuter singular. Like in the
negative existential construction, in the past and future tenses, you have to use the
verb biti (je² +) be instead of imati:
Bilo je jabukaG. There were some apples.
Bilo je vodeG. There was some water.
Bit će krviG. There will be blood. ®
We have already encountered negative existential constructions, which behave
exactly the same, but use negative forms. They include a very common phrase,
corresponding to English no problem (enter it into Google™):
Nema° problemaG. There are no problems.
Such sentences are no way limited to indefinite amounts ("some") – they can
express existence (or negation of existence) of any quantity:
Bilo je previše problemaG. There were too many problems.
Ima° dosta ljudiG. There are quite a few people.
However, to express existence of a definite quantity of something countable, such
impersonal constructions are less used. This verb can be used instead:
postojati (postoji) exist
Another way is to use definite (i.e. counted) quantity, but in the nominative case
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 45 Quan!!es and Existence
265 / 600

postojati
with the existential constructions – however, they have to be counted then, i.e. you
can’t omit even jedan (jedn-) one. For example:
Postoji (jedanN) otokN gdje... There’s an island where... ®
Ima° jedan otokN gdje... (the same meaning, but jedan is mandatory)
You can use any expression (I personally prefer the first one). You can also use such
existential expressions to say that there’s someone (but I then prefer the exist verb
even more).®
If you want to express existence of indefinite quantity at some location, the neutral
expression is:
Ima° vodeG u bociDL. There is some water in the bottle.
Bilo je vodeG u bociDL. There was some water in the bottle.
The following expression specifically talks about what’s in the bottle, literally in
bottle is water (the noun voda is in the nominative case):
U bociDL je vodaN. (N) There is water in the bottle.
If we change the word order, there’s a subtle change in meaning: we’re no more
talking about the bottle, we’re talking about the water, and where it is:
VodaN je u bociDL. The water is in the bottle.
The word order in Croatian is mostly such that what we’re talking about comes first,
and the information we want to give comes later. This is also a way of expressing
definiteness, since Croatian has no articles. Another example:
KljučeviN su u ladiciDL. The keys are in the drawer. ®
U ladiciDL su (nekiN) ključevi.N There are (some) keys in the drawer.
In the first sentence, we’re talking about where the keys are, but in the second,
we’re discussing what’s in the drawer, what we have found.
________
® In Serbia, and most of Bosnia, the following words and forms are used instead (on
the right side of arrows):
kava coffee → kafa
kruh bread → hljeb, hleb
otok island → ostrvo
sol f salt → so (sol-) f
zrak air → vazduh
While ladica is used in Serbia as well, the word fioka is much more common there
for the drawer.
Using nešto as a quantity-adverb few, some is much rarer in Serbia, and using it to
express few people (nešto ljudi) is very rare there.
Recall that the future tense is not spelled bit će, but biće in Serbia and often in
Bosnia.

• Examples
This pop hit – Plešem sama I dance alone by Detour, a Croatian laid-back pop group,
contains two existential constructions:
A bit će teških danaG
And there will be hard days
I jutraG koja meA ne vole
And mornings that don’t like me
I ne znaš gdje imDL je krajN
And you don’t know where they end
 
 
Nema teG
You’re not here
I sad plešem samaN
And now I dance alone
Zatvorim očiA i sanjam
I close my eyes and dream
(N. Borgudan)
You can listen to it on YouTube™.
The first existential construction expresses that there will be some amount of težak
dan i jutro; all this is put into G-pl.
The phrase koja me ne vole is a relative clause; the expression kraj je² + DL means
that something (expressed in the DL case) ends, ‘it’s the end to it’.
The second existential construction, nema te is a negative existential, introduced
long ago.
Using secondary predicates such as sam alone was introduced back in 35 Tools and
Means, With and Without. Here it reveals that the subject is female.
The verb zatvoriti («) close is from the pair:
zatvarati («) ~ zatvoriti («) close
Why is a perfective verb used in the present tense? Likely, the sentence doesn’t refer
to the present moment, as if onda then or ponekad then are somehow implied.
Observe that its object is just oči f pl. eyes: the possession of body parts is, as usual,
implied.

46 More than Four Things
Counting more than 4 items is quite simple: just use the number and put the noun in
genitive plural after it:
Imam pet jabukaG. I have five apples.
If you want to use one of adjectives that come before numbers (that is, determiners
as taj (t-) that or possessives), they should be in G-pl as well:
Imam ovihG pet jabukaG. I have these five apples.
If you use them as a subject, it behaves as neuter singular:
Pet jabukaG je bilo u kutijiDL. Five apples were in the box.
These table summarize use of various numbers in Croatian (for masc. nouns on the
left, for feminine on the right):
jedan
neki
svaki
čovjek
vrabac
je pjevao
dva
tri
četiri

You can see e.g. 30 minuta on a 30-minute Zagreb public transport short ride ticket
(karta):
Some numbers greater than 4 behave as numbers 1-4: it all depends on the last word
in the number:
21 dvadeset i jedan → behaves as jedan (jedn-)
53 pedeset i tri → behaves as tri
So, for such numbers, rules for using nouns and adjectives with numbers 1-4 apply:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 46 More than Four Things
268 / 600

1
Imam dvadeset i jednu jabukuA. I have 21 apples. (A)
Imam pedeset i tri jabuke24. I have 53 apples. (G)
In the same manner, rules for 1-4 don’t apply to numbers 11, 12, 13 and 14: they
don’t end with any of the words above, but with -naest, which makes them
behave like 5 or 10. (This applies to English as well: 12 is twelve – does it end in
two in speech?)
The number zero also behaves as a number greater than 4 (note that English requires
here plural as well!):
Imam nula jabukaG. I have 0 apples.
For numbers with decimal points (in Croatian, a comma is often used instead of the
decimal point) it again depends on the last word:
Imam dva cijela pet kilogramaG. I have 2.5 kilos. (G-pl)
Imam dva cijela jedan kilogramA. I have 2.1 kilos. (A)
Instead of cijela, words točka dot and zarez comma ® are also used.
Now, we can finally say how old someone is. In Croatian, the primary way to specify
age is to say that someone ‘has years’:
Imam dvadeset i jednu godinuA. I’m 21 years old. (lit. ‘I have 21 years.’)
GoranN ima osam godinaG. Goran is 8 years old. (lit. ‘Goran has 8 years.’)
If you know some Spanish, you will notice it uses exactly the same construction to
express this (Goran tiene 8 años).
Alternatively, ‘having years’ is sometimes expressed with the person in DL, and years
in N; second position words usually split number + year:
Dvadeset i jednaN miDL je godinaN. (the same meaning, but less frequent)
GoranuDL je osam godinaG. (the same meaning, but less frequent)
This is rarer than using imati have, but you’ll sometimes read and hear it, especially
in literature and songs.®
To ask how old someone is, use again the question word koliko how many
(sometimes stressed as koliko) – as this is a quantity adverb, the word it refers to
(here godina year) must be in genitive plural:
Koliko imaš godinaG? How old are you? (lit. ‘How many years do you have?’)
— Osam. Eight.
The same holds for any question about quantity of something countable, even if one
who is asking knows it’s less than five:
Koliko imaš jabukaG? How many apples do you have?
— Tri. Three.
You’ll sometimes see the DL for age in questions as well:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 46 More than Four Things
269 / 600

2
Koliko tiDL je godinaG? (the same meaning, sometimes used)
There’s a useful way to express at what age you did something:
s¨ / sa¨ + age (in instrumental) = at the age of...
For example:
Prvi put sam letio avionomI s dvanaest godinaG. I flew in an airplane for the first
time at the age of twelve.
You’ll sometimes see just s¨ + number, years are assumed then. However, it’s also
usual to express this with an embedded time clause, starting with kad(a):
Prvi put sam letio avionomI kad sam imao dvanaest. I flew in an airplane for the
first time when I was twelve.
Such clauses are really sentences-within-a-sentence; any second-position words
(e.g. sam²) come right after the word kad(a).
Bigger numbers use the following words – there’s more than one word for numbers
100 and 1000:
100
sto (adv.) / stotina
1000
tisuća ®
/ hiljada (colloq.) ®
million
milijun ®
The above words are nouns (except sto) and can change case according to usual
roles (the counted noun is always in G-pl, of course):
Imam tisućuA dolaraG. I have one thousand dollars.
TisućaN dolaraG je u ladiciDL. One thousand dollars are in the drawer. ®
The Standard Croatian noun for 1000 is tisuća, while the noun hiljada is colloquial;
both words are used in speech (I personally use tisuća).
The Croatian verb is in singular, since we’re talking about a thousand – only one
thousand, like one box containing small pieces of paper.
Pay attention that milijun million is always a noun in Croatian. While you usually say
in English five million men, in Croatian you have to adjust the word to the number
before it, and a noun after the million always goes into G-pl:
U HrvatskojDL živi četiri milijuna24 ljudiG. Four million people live in Croatia.
The nouns listed above – except milijun million – are often used as ‘adverbs’
(identical to the accusative forms of nouns), regardless of their role, especially
tisuća:
Tisuću dolaraG je u ladiciDL. One thousand dollars are in the drawer.
If you use the accusative form as subject (i.e. an ‘adverb’), don’t forget it then
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 46 More than Four Things
270 / 600

behaves as any quantity adverb, that is, adjectives and past forms of verbs must be
put to neuter singular. Compare the following sentences:
Tisuću dolaraG je bilo u ladiciDL. (adverb) One thousand dollars were in the drawer.
TisućaN dolaraG je bila u ladiciDL. (fem. noun, the same meaning)
While in English it’s a rule to say one thousand (or one million), in Croatian it’s a rule
to use just tisuća (or milijun) – it’s assumed there’s one if the word is in singular.
If you have two thousands (or more) you don’t have an option to use accusative,
you have to follow rules for counting two things (or more) – things counted are
thousands. Therefore the word tisuća goes into either G or G-pl, the same as if you
were counting money in bags or any other noun:
Imam dvije tisuće24 dolaraG. I have two thousand dollars.
Imam pet tisućaG dolaraG. I have five thousand dollars.
Hundreds are expressed as:
200 dvjesto
300 tristo
400 četiristo
500 petsto
600 šesto
700 sedamsto
800 osamsto
900 devetsto
(There are archaic forms dvjesta 200 and trista 300 ® as well, dvjesta appears on
banknotes.) Since they are derived from sto, they never change their form. You’ll
occasionally see the number 600 spelled as šeststo. In Croatian, numbers bigger that
1000 are never expressed as nineteen hundred, always as one thousand and nine
hundred.
Ordinals derived from sto, tisuća and milijun are a bit irregular and end in -ti:
stoti hundredth
tisućiti thousandth ®
milijunti millionth ®
Thousands are, of course, used for years, as ordinal numbers; in singular, the adverb
form tisuću is only used:
1996. tisuću devetsto devedeset (i) šesta
2015. dvije tisuće (i) petnaesta
In speech, years are often referred to with shortened ordinals, where the word for
thousand is left out (and often the number of hundreds, if there’s no confusion):
1996. devetsto devedeset šesta (colloq.)
1996. devedeset šesta (colloq.)
2015. dvije i petnaesta (colloq.)
Unfortunately, there’s one more complication left. Some nouns don’t have a real
plural: dijete child and brat brother use so-called collective nouns, which are not
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 46 More than Four Things
271 / 600

really plural. So, if you want to count children and brothers, you have to use a
specific way of counting them, which will be described in the following chapter.
________
® Besides zarez comma, the word zapeta is also used in Serbia. You will also
occassionally hear koma. Instead of točka, tačka is used in Serbia and parts of
Bosnia.
Using DL to express ‘possession’ of years seems to be very rare in Serbia.
While ladica is used in Serbia as well, the word fioka is much more common there
for the drawer.
Instead of tisuća and milijun, words hiljada and milion are used in Bosnia and
Serbia, and are often heard in Croatia as well. The ordinals are hiljaditi and milionti.
The forms dvjesta and trista are much more common in Serbia and Bosnia, and in
the “Ikavian” forms (e.g. dvista) in Dalmatia, a part of Croatia.
• Examples
This cjenik price list for driving toy cars nicely illustrates use of various noun forms
with numbers:
You can see how much longer G-pl is used with the number 10. The noun krug is
literally circle, but is used for rounds in games and play as well.

47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Counting Children
We learned how to make the plural of nouns. However, if you ask an average
Croatian speaker what the plural of list leaf is, chances are he or she will answer it’s
lišće, and not listovi, the form you learned so hard! What’s going on?
Also, what is going on with the noun brat brother? How do you talk about brothers
in Croatian? Or children?
It turns out that for some words standing for things that exist as individual items, but
which often come in hard-to-count heaps, there’s another singular noun that stands
for the whole heap. Such noun is usually called a collective or mass noun.
Mass nouns in singular stand for any amount, except for a single item (that is, if you
see a single leaf, you should use list). English hasn’t many mass nouns, but has one
for leaves – foliage.
Mass nouns are more frequent in Croatian. Actually, they are so often used for any
larger amount of some things that regular plurals of certain nouns are used very
rarely.
Common nouns having often used mass nouns are:
noun
mass noun
cvijet flower
cvijeće
grana branch
granje
grm bush ®
grmlje
kamen stone
kamenje
list leaf
lišće
trn thorn
trnje
As you can see, all mass nouns above are neuter, and end in either -će or -je. For
instance, if Ana likes flowers, you would say:
AnaN voli cvijećeA. Ana likes flowers.
Bear in mind that cvijeće is a singular noun:
CvijećeN raste. Flowers grow.
The noun list doesn’t mean only leaf of a plant; as in English, it could also mean leaf
of paper (list papira), e.g. in a book. For such ‘leaves’, the mass noun is never used –
the regular plural noun is used instead.
There are a couple of mass nouns where the original, individual noun is no longer
used; such nouns are used for any amount, but have singular forms only:
piće drink(s)
smeće garbage
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Coun!ng Children
273 / 600

pomagati
povrće vegetable(s)
oružje weapon(s)
rublje laundry, underwear
suđe dishes ®
voće fruit(s)
The noun piće drink is sometimes seen in plural, when it stands for more than one
single drink, but it can be used in singular for a number of drinks on a table. The noun
rublje stands both for a mass of clothes that needs to be washed, dried etc. and for
underwear and other frequently washed items of clothing. (Colloquially, you will
often hear another mass noun, veš – with exactly the same meaning – instead of
rublje.)
Two more common mass nouns are similar to the nouns above, but they end in -a.
They are feminine (singular, of course, but stand for any amount):
obuća footwear
odjeća clothes
Then, there are two important nouns that have completely lost their plural, and
collective nouns are always used instead. They are:
noun (no pl.) collective noun
brat brother
braća
dijete child
djeca
At first, they appear as normal, feminine singular nouns ending in -a:
Čekam djecuA. I’m waiting for my children.
Pomažem tvojoj braćiDL. I’m helping your brothers.
However, when they are subjects of a sentence, verbs come in plural:
DjecaN čekaju mamuA. Children are waiting for their mum.
BraćaN su gladnaN. Brothers are hungry.
BraćaN su bila gladnaN. Brothers were hungry.
Adjectives and past forms of verbs always have feminine singular forms with these
two nouns, even when the verbs come in plural.
(This special behavior doesn’t apply to e.g. odjeća, only to braća and djeca.)
What about collective nouns in I have no... sentences? Is A or G used? It seems the
special collective nouns djeca children and braća brothers are used in both G and A
with negative sentences, with the same frequency.®

Finally, how to count children in Croatian? If you have less than 5 children, you can
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Coun!ng Children
274 / 600

use forms of the singular dijete (djetet-), but what if you have 5 or more? Is there a
way to count more than 4 children? What about counting ljudi m pl. people, which
has plural only?
Luckily, there’s another set of numbers, used to count plural and collective nouns,
usually called collective numbers:
Collective numbers
both oboje
 5
petero
2
dvoje
 6
šestero
3
troje
 7
sedm-ero
4
četvero  etc.
The pattern for larger numbers is: take an ordinal adjective (e.g. osm-i), remove the
final -i and add -ero. You will sometimes hear versions of these numbers with -oro
(e.g. četvoro).®
They are used to with nouns in G-pl:
Imam petero djeceG. I have five children.
Razgovarao sam s troje ljudiG. I talked to three people.
(You’ll sometimes also see and hear simply pet djece and like: this is both
uncommon and non-standard.)
The collective numbers are secondary: if you can use the normal numbers (as with
most numbers) you will not use the collective ones! Therefore, they are mostly used
to count the three nouns (ljudi, djeca and braća), but even with braća you will very
often hear and read:
Imam dva brata24. I have two brothers.
Collective numbers can be used, but for some reason people prefer dva brata to
dvoje braće.
However, when you have e.g. two friends or two guests of opposite sex, you have
to use collective numbers:
2 friends
2 guests
all-male
dva prijatelja24
dva gosta24
all-female
dvije prijateljice24
dvije gošće24
mixed (G-pl!) dvoje prijateljaG
dvoje gostijuG
This is the solution to the ‘mixed-sex’ problem in counting. Pay attention that the
last form is in G-pl, while the first two are just ordinary forms used with numbers 2-4
(like G for nouns). They coincide with G-pl for the noun prijatelj friend (in writing,
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Coun!ng Children
275 / 600

otići past-n
otići past-mpl
not for those who have different vowel length in speech), but not for e.g. the noun
gost guest.
The collective numbers can be used on their own, and they imply a number of
people, of mixed or unknown sex. They behave as other adverbs, as if in neuter
singular, but you’ll sometimes see masculine plural as well:
ObojeN je otišlo. Both left.
ObojeN su otišli. (sometimes used)
Some collective nouns have shifted their meaning, and are used as nouns
independent of the base noun. Common ones are:
grob tomb → groblje cemetery
osoba person → osoblje staff, personnel
Finally, what about nouns like pile (pilet-) chicken? There are two ways to handle
plural for them.
First, you simply avoid such nouns. For most of them, Croatian has other nouns with
the same meaning, but completely regular:
noun
replacement(s)
mače (mačet-) kitten
mačić
pile (pilet-) chick
pilić
štene (štenet-) puppy
psić
štenac (štenc-)
In fact, people are avoiding such nouns so much that nowadays mačić is much more
often used than mače in Croatian.
The second way is to use mass nouns ending in -ad that behave as feminine nouns
ending in a consonant. They are not often used in the the spoken Croatian:
noun
mass noun
mače (mačet-) kitten
mačad f
pile (pilet-) chick
pilad f
štene (štenet-) puppy
štenad f
Certain nouns that are taken from English are treated as singular, mass nouns in
Croatian. An example is čips, known in American English as potato chips, and in
British English as crisps:
Ovaj čipsN je stvarno dobarN. These potato chips are really good.
Observe how the Croatian sentence uses only (masculine) singular forms of
adjectives and verbs!
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 47 Of Flowers, Thorns and Coun!ng Children
276 / 600

The preposition među among is used when there are more than two things, but it
can be also used with collective nouns, e.g. među lišćem among the leaves;
alternatively, you can use u¨ + DL (e.g. u lišću).
________
® Besides grm, in Bosnia and Serbia, another word is used, especially for larger
bushes: žbun; from it, there’s a collective noun žbunje.
The individual noun sud vessel, pot is very rare in Croatia, but often heard in Bosnia
and Serbia. Its regular plural sudovi is common in these countries.
Forms like četvoro are very frequent and standard in Bosnia and Serbia.
Using A djecu with negative imati have is much more common in Bosnia, and
prevails in Serbia – if you Google™ on the .rs domain for "nemam decu" and
"nemam dece", you’ll get a ratio bigger than 10:1.

48 Wholes, Parts, Heaps and Pairs
How to express half an apple? Or third? If you think you can just use ordinal
numbers (e.g. treći third) to express parts (e.h. third of an apple), you cannot. They
must be ‘adjusted’ a bit.
In English, third is both an adjective (the third man) and a noun (two thirds). The
Croatian form treći corresponds to the adjective meaning only!
However, it’s simple to make a noun from it: just add -na and you have the partial
noun you need (except for the word for half does not fit to this scheme at all). For
1/2 and 1/4 there are additional words that behave like adverbs:
noun
adverb
1/2
polovina
pol(a)
1/3
trećina
1/4
četvrtina
četvrt
1/5
petina
etc.
part
dio (dijel-) m ®
I have listed also a generic noun meaning just part. How to use them? Well, just use
the above nouns as any nouns on -na, and the other noun (one you want to express
part of) goes after it, in the genitive singular:
OvoN je trećinaN jabukeG. This is a third of an apple.
Imam trećinuA jabukeG. I have a third of an apple.
Instead of polovina, adverb pol(a) is much more frequent; it doesn’t change, of
course, since it’s not a noun, but an adverb:
OvoN je pola jabukeG. This is half an apple.
Imam pola jabukeG. I have half of an apple.
Such partial quantities are in singular; pol(a) is neuter and other partial nouns are
feminine, as expected:
Pola jabukeG je bilo na stoluDL. Half of an apple was on the table.
TrećinaN jabukeG je bila na stoluDL. A third of an apple was on the table.
Just remember that you are talking about a third (of something) and not about
something.
In Croatia, bread is usually sold in loaves and some types are cut in half if required
by the customer. So you can ask at the bread counter, or in a bakery:
Molim VasA pola kruhaG. ‘A half of bread, please.’ (i.e. a half of a loaf of bread)

It’s possible to use parts with nouns in genitive plural, meaning a part of some plural
quantity, possibly the total quantity; then partial quantities get verbs in plural
sometimes:
Pola jabukaG je bilo zreloN. Half of apples were ripe.
Pola ljudiG su bili ženeN. Half of the people were women.
The use of plural in such sentences prevails with people and animals, while singular
is common with other things (apples, stones...).
The generic dio (dijel-) m part can be used with both singular and plural nouns (in
genitive, of course):
Imam dioA jabukeG. I have a part of an apple.
Imam dioA jabukaG. I have ‘a part’ of apples. (i.e. a part of some set of apples)
This is unlike English, where part cannot be used with plural nouns!
The quantity in Croatian has always gender of the quantity-word (neuter for
adverbs). For instance, since dio (dijel-) is masculine, the whole quantity is masculine
singular:
DioN jabukeG je bio na stoluDL. A part of the apple was on the table.
DioN ljudiG je plesao. Some people were dancing.
There are two very useful words:
komad piece ®
kriška slice
The word komad is very often used, in a similar way as English piece ®. You can have
a piece of something, but all countable, material stuff (e.g. screws) is very often
expressed in pieces:
Jedem komadA kruhaG. I’m eating a piece of bread. ®
(You will maybe occasionally hear the word also stressed as komad.)
The word kriška slice usually gets -i in G-pl, so you would ask:
Molim VasA deset kriškiG šunkeG. Ten slices of ham, please.
(Besides the word kriška for slice, you’ll often hear and read colloquial words šnita
and feta: the former prevails inland, while the latter dominates on the Croatian
coast.)
There are two more useful generic quantity nouns:
manjina minority
većina majority, most
These nouns can be used either as measures or on its own:
VećinaN ljudiG je gledala utakmicuA. Most people watched the match.
VećinaN je gledala utakmicuA. Most watched the match.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 48 Wholes, Parts, Heaps and Pairs
279 / 600

There are several other nouns that can be used as measures of countable nouns in
plural and uncountable in singular. The result behaves as the quantity noun.
gomila bunch, big quantity
kutija box
hrpa heap
vreća bag, sack
žlica spoon ®
For example:
GomilaN ljudiG je bila na trguDL. A large crowd of people was at the town square.
HrpaN pijeskaG je bila u dvorištuDL. A heap of sand was in the yard.
While gomila is very generic, there are specific words for various groups of animals
(which are, nevertheless, a bit less specific than in English):
krdo herd (of wild animals, sometimes cattle)
stado herd (of domesticated animals)
jato flock / school (of fish)
roj swarm
čopor pack (of carnivores)
For example:
Vidim stadoN ovacaG. I see a herd of sheep.
(The noun ovca sheep is one of nouns that shift their stress to the inserted -a- in
G-pl.)
Then, there’s a noun which is also used as an adverb:
par pair
This noun is used primarily with things that come in pairs, like gloves, shoes, socks,
and such pairs can be counted:
Imam dva para24 cipelaG. I have two pairs of shoes.
Of course, the noun which is in pair comes in G-pl. Exactly like in English, this noun is
often used to enable counting of the noun hlače f pl. pants, trousers since that noun
cannot be counted by normal means – it doesn’t have singular forms at all, including
the form needed after numbers 2, 3, 4 – but it has G-pl:
Imaš tri para24 hlačaG. You have three pairs of pants. ®
Be careful: with nouns that don’t normally come in pairs, the word par is rather a
quantity adverb which doesn’t change, and, when subject, causes verbs to be in
3rd person neuter singular:
Imam par majicaG. I have a couple of T-shirts. (adverb)
U ormaruDL je bilo par majicaG. A couple of T-shirts were in the wardrobe.
(adverb)
U ormaruDL je bio parN cipelaG. A pair of shoes was in the wardrobe. (noun)

kilogram

measure food ®. For example, if you would like a specific amount of cheese, you
would ask at the counter:
Molim VasA deset dekaG siraG. (colloq.) Ten decagrams of cheese, please. ®
There are more units and it’s interesting the masculine ones always have plural in
just -i, regardless of the number of syllables:
gram → grami
As you can see, the noun sat in the meaning hour fits into this group too.
There’s an adjective used to express the opposite of parts:
cijel whole (adjective!) ®
This word behaves like any adjective – it doesn’t affect the noun, but agrees with it
(i.e. change case, gender, singular/plural according to the noun). For example:
Trebam cijelu jabukuA. I need a whole apple.
There are three more words used to express quantities – only of countable nouns –
they behave like adjectives too:
koji few (+ sing.)
mnogi many (+ plur.)
neki one, some (+ sing./plur.)
  adjectives used with
countable nouns
Words neki and koji are of course adjectives (koji has special shortened forms as
well). They are used with countable nouns only and don’t change the case of the
following noun, they don’t use the G-pl. For example:
Imam koju jabukuA. (A) I have few apples.
Imam neku jabukuA negdje. I have an apple somewhere.
The word neki just expresses indefiniteness, while koji stands for a unknown, but
likely small number of things of some kind. Here singular is used with koji, but the
meaning is plural.
Now the confusing part: the adjective mnogi is used with nouns in plural. The
problem is that its neuter singular form – mnogo – is used as a quantity adverb. So
both can be said:
(1) Mnogo pticaG leti na jugA. Many birds fly south.
(2) MnogeN pticeN lete na jugA. (more or less the same meaning)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 48 Wholes, Parts, Heaps and Pairs
281 / 600

Observe the different verb forms: the subject of the sentence #1 behaves as neuter
singular (due to the quantity adverb), while the subject of the sentence #2 is just a
noun (in plural) with an adjective, as if we said big birds or gray birds. In the past
tense:
(1) Mnogo pticaG je letjelo na jugA. Many birds were flying south.
(2) MnogeN pticeN su letjele na jugA. (more or less the same meaning)
If there’s any difference in meaning, it’s so subtle that I don’t have any idea.
However, sentences like #2 are much more common with nouns like ljudi pl. people,
žena woman/wife.
Of course, like other generic adjectives, mnogi can be also used as a pronoun:
MnogiN ne vole mlijekoA. Many don’t like milk.
Razgovarao sam s mnogimaII. I talked to many.
Such use is more common than in English. However, the related adverb mnogo
cannot be used as a pronoun! To use it generically, you have to add some pronoun,
most often the 3rd pers. plural pronoun:
Mnogo ihG leti na jugA. Many are flying south.
This holds generally: quantity adverbs cannot be used as pronouns. They need a
noun or pronoun (in G) beside them.
Here are three generic adjectives often-used-as-pronouns (you’ll encounter more in
the future):
neki some
mnogi many
sav (sv- +) all
Of course, these are masc. pl. forms, for all-female groups, you would use fem. pl.
forms.
You can combine numbers with parts, but observe different behaviors:
Imam dvije trećine24 limunaG. I have two thirds of an lemon.
Imam dva cijela limuna24. I have two whole lemons.
In the first sentence, two counts thirds – so we have feminine gender – while in the
second, it counts (whole) lemons.

® In Serbia, the word dio (dijel-) m part has an unexpected “Ekavian” form deo (del-)
m.
In Serbia, komad is used only in meaning whole piece, i.e. as a unit (e.g. buy two
pieces, get one for free), while piece as a part (e.g. piece of pizza or piece of cake) is
expressed with the noun parče (parčet-).

Instead of kruh, in most of Bosnia, the word hljeb is used for bread; in Serbia, it has
“Ekavian” form hleb.
In Serbia and most of Bosnia instead of žlica spoon, kašika is used.
In Serbia and Bosnia instead of hlače f pl. trousers, pantalone f pl. is used.
Using deka (colloq.) decagram to measure food is uncommon in Serbia – grams are
used there, so one would ask for 100 grams of cheese. This is very rare in Croatia.
In Serbia, the word cijel whole has an unexpected “Ekavian” form ceo (cel-).
• Something Possibly Interesting
Ten decagrams of cheese, and ten decagrams of ham, with a quarter of loaf of
bread, is a common lunch for many employees in Croatia, especially ones doing
manual labor. So, people who work at the cold cut and cheese counters in shops in
Croatia know exactly how many slices of šunka ham and sir cheese are
approximately 10 deka, but they will always weigh it as well.

49 For 7 Hours: Definite Periods
We know how to say two hours and five days, and now we are going to make use of
these expressions to say how long some action or state lasts (or lasted).
If you want to say that something took a specific amount of time (two hours, three
days, etc.) you don’t have to – you must not – use any prepositions in Croatian, the
only thing you need is to put the time period into the accusative case:
Plivao sam dva sata24. I was swimming for two hours.
AnaN je živjela u ZagrebuDL pet godinaG. Ana lived in Zagreb for five years.
Recall that constructions with numbers greater than 1 look the same in all cases.
However, when something took one year (or one week, etc.), both words must go to
the accusative case, since jedan (jedn-) one is an adjective:
Trčao sam jedan satA. I was running for one hour.
AnaN je živjela u ZadruDL jednu godinuA. Ana lived in Zadar for one year.
Don’t forget that G-pl, used with numbers 5 and on, often has a slightly specific
form:
dva tjedna24 two weeks (‘G’) ®
pet tjedanaG five weeks (G-pl)
Now, there’s a very important rule, the time-phrase rule, basically saying that you
have to say how many hours (or years, weeks...) something took: you cannot just say
"trčao sam sat"!
However, there are four often used special phrases:
godina dana 1 year
mjesec dana 1 month
tjedan dana 1 week ®
sat vremena 1 hour
They are just words for time periods + another word, dan day or vrijeme (vremen-)
time/weather in the genitive case. Literally, they mean a year of days, and so on.
The first word is free to change case, so the two sentences above often look like
this when phrases are put to the accusative case as they must be if used as time
periods:
Trčao sam satA vremenaG. I was running for an hour.
AnaN je živjela u ZadruDL godinuA danaG. Ana lived in Zadar for a year.
Of course, you can also say jedna godina, etc. (Observe there are no special phrases
for one day or one minute).
You don’t have to use numbers, can use parts, or adjectives. All grammar rules we
already learned for expressing parts still apply, of course:
Plivao sam pola sataG. I was swimming for half an hour.
AnaN je živjela u OsijekuDL cijelu godinuA. Ana lived in Osijek for a whole year.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 49 For 7 Hours: Deﬁnite Periods
284 / 600

f
AnaN je živjela u ZagrebuDL mnogo godinaA. Ana lived in Osijek for many years.
As time nouns (i.e. dan day etc.) don’t normally come in pairs, the word par means a
couple of with them. Of course, you can use nekoliko several too:
Hodao sam par satiG. I was walking for a couple of hours.
AnaN je živjela u RijeciDL nekoliko mjeseciG. Ana lived in Osijek for a several months.
These time expressions look like objects – and are a bit similar to objects: you can
eat the whole cake, likewise, you could live the whole year. But they aren’t really
objects.
These rules also apply when you use other nouns for time periods such as:
jutro morning
prijepodne (prijepodnev-) time before noon
popodne (popodnev-) afternoon
noć f night
večer f evening ®
trenutak (trenutk-) moment
vikend weekend
vječnost f eternity
For example:
Plesali smo cijelu noćA. We were dancing for the whole night.
Such use of cijeli also translates English phrases like all day long. It applies to
seasons as well:
KišaN je padala cijelu zimuA. It was raining for the whole winter.
There’s a verb expressing duration of some event or state (e.g. predavanje lecture,
kiša rain, oluja storm, etc.) expressed by a noun:
trajati (traje) last, take time
For example (observe that the time-phrase rule still holds):
FilmN je trajao dva sata24. The movie lasted for two hours.
PredavanjeN je trajalo jedan satA. The lecture lasted for one hour.
But what if you’re still reading or waiting, or the it? In English, you should use the
Present Perfect tense (have been), but in Croatian you should use the present tense:
IvanN je dvije godine živio u ZagrebuDL. Ivan lived in Zagreb for two years. (but not
now)
IvanN dvije godine živi u ZagrebuDL. Ivan has lived in Zagreb for two years. (and still
does)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 49 For 7 Hours: Deﬁnite Periods
285 / 600

f
This is worth remembering:
not anymore
still ongoing
Croatian
past tense
present tense
English
Past
Present Perfect
If you use the present tense, it means it still goes on; if it’s something that
happened only in the past, use the past tense. Croatian is here much simpler and
logical (at least from my point of view) than English.
In all uses described above, the periods in currently ongoing actions are often
emphasized with već already, which has a weakened meaning and is often not
translated:
IvanN već dvije godine živi u ZagrebuDL. Ivan has lived in Zagreb for two years.
With almost all perfective verbs, it’s impossible to say how long the action lasted,
but it’s possible to express the ‘time frame’ of the action, and the meaning is more
or less the same. Interestingly, English also distinguishes duration from ‘frames’:
‘time frames’ use the preposition in. In Croatian, you should use the preposition za¨
+ time phrase:
Čitao sam knjiguA dva dana24. I was reading the book for two days. (impf.)
Pročitao sam knjiguA za dva dana24. I’ve read the book in two days. (perf.)
This gives you a good clue when to use perf. verbs in Croatian: if you feel that an
expression like in a day would fit into the sentence, use a perf. verb in Croatian.
Pay attention that Croatian za¨ usually translates to English for, but it’s not so here.
The same works for times until a moment in the future, they are expressed with za¨
+ time phrase as well:
Pročitat ću knjiguA za jedan danA. I’ll read the book in a day.
Pročitat ću knjiguA za par danaG. I’ll read the book in a couple of days.
The time-phrase rule is a bit relaxed when you use za¨, so you’ll occasionally hear
expressions with only one word:
Pročitao sam knjiguA za jedan danA. I’ve read the book in a day.
Pročitao sam knjiguA za jednu noćA. I’ve read the book in a night.
Pročitao sam knjiguA za danA. (the same meaning, sometimes heard)
Now, the English preposition for is also used in sentences like this:
(1) I’m leaving for two days.
(2) I’ll leave for a week.
There’s a subtle difference. In Croatian, ‘leave’ is a motion, going somewhere else. It
won’t take two days (or a week) to get there, you will rather go somewhere, spend
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 49 For 7 Hours: Deﬁnite Periods
286 / 600

some time there, and then you’ll return, and the whole thing will take two days (or a
week).
In Croatian, if you want to express duration of the whole ‘round-trip’, that is, going
somewhere – staying there – going back, where going back is implied, you have to
use the preposition na¨ + A:
(1) Odlazim na dva dana24.
(2) Otići ću na tjedanA danaG.
If you construct the sentence #1 without the na¨, it will sound extremely weird, as if
you spent two days trying to leave, but you haven’t left yet. The sentence #2 will be
ungrammatical without a preposition, since the verb is, of course, perfective.
Such ‘round-trip periods’ apply to all motion verbs that imply going somewhere, e.g.
ići (ide, išao, išla) go, and to some other verbs that will be explained later (e.g.
meaning borrow, etc.)
This summarizes common time periods in English and Croatian (the accusative time
phrases, marked with A*, must consist of two or more words, special phrases may
be used.):
definite period
  for two days
A*
dva dana
‘time frame’
  in two days
za¨ + A(*)
za dva dana
‘round-trip’ (e.g. leave)
  for two days
na¨ + A*
na dva dana
To ask how long something lasted, you can use koliko dugo (lit. ‘how much long’) or
just koliko:
Koliko dugo si živio tamo? How long did you live there?
— Jednu godinuA. For a year.
Koliko ste bili u HrvatskojDL? How long were you in Croatia?
— TjedanA danaG. For a week.
Answers must be proper time periods, that is, in A, at least 2 words, special phrases
can be used, prepositions according to the rules for time periods.
To ask about a ‘round-trip period’, you have to use na¨ before the question words
explained above. Answers will be again ‘round-trip periods’:
Na koliko odlaziš? How long are you leaving for?
— Na tjedanA danaG. For a week.
These were ways to express how long something took. You often have to express
something else – when something was going on, in relation to the present or some
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 49 For 7 Hours: Deﬁnite Periods
287 / 600

other moment. For example:
Živio sam u ZagrebuDL prije dvije godine24. I lived in Zagreb two years ago.
Živio sam u NjemačkojDL prije godinuA danaG. I lived in Germany one year ago.
Now, the time periods – if special phrases are not used – can be sometimes in G as
well.
This is relative reference to something else said before, not to the present:
Radio sam u SplituDL dvije godine24 ranije. I worked in Zagreb two years earlier.
Živio sam u AmericiDL jednu godinuA ranije. I lived in America a year earlier.
Now again, you must use time expressions in A, and ranije comes after them.
Instead of ranije, you can use prije toga before that, or even just prije – but it must
be placed after the time expression. A similar expression is used to refer to a time
after something else:
Radio sam u školiDL dvije godine24 kasnije. I worked in a school two years later.
Again, instead of kasnije, you can use poslije toga, or even only poslije. Also, it’s
common to put these reference at the front:
Dvije godine24 ranije radio sam u SplituDL. Two years earlier, I worked in Split.
Dvije godine24 kasnije radio sam u školiDL. Two years later, I worked in a school.
References to the future times, relative to now, use the same ‘time frame’ way in
both English and Croatian:
Vraćam se za dva mjeseca24. I’m coming back in two months.
This table summarizes relative time references:
before now
a year ago
prije + A* (G*)
prije jedne godine
after now
in a year
za¨ + A*
za jednu godinu
before
something else
a year earlier
A* ranije
jednu godinu ranije
A* prije (toga)
jednu godinu prije (toga)
after
something else
a year later
A* kasnije
jednu godinu kasnije
A* poslije (toga) 
jednu godinu poslije (toga)
To ask about references to the past or future time, use the question-word kad(a)
when. The answer is a proper past reference (for the past) or a proper ‘time frame’
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 49 For 7 Hours: Deﬁnite Periods
288 / 600

for the future. Of course, absolute times can be used as well (e.g. a month, date,
etc.):
Kad si se vratio? When did you come back?
— Prije dva mjeseca24. Two months ago.
— U trećem mjesecuDL. (colloq.) In March. (lit. ‘in the 3rd month’) ®
Kad se vraćaš? When are you coming back?
— Za mjesecA danaG. In a month.
— U desetom mjesecuDL. (colloq.) In October. (lit. ‘in the 10th month’) ®
Also, pay attention that in the first question, we have used a perfective verb vratiti
return. Here we ask about one, specific event in the past. In then second question,
we used an ordinary impf. verb, since we used the present tense to talk about a
scheduled event in the future.
________
® Instead of tjedan, the word nedjelja is used in parts of Bosnia, colloquially in parts
of Croatia, and in the “Ekavian” form nedelja in Serbia; so you’ll hear and read
nedjelja dana or nedelju dana. The word sedmica is also sometimes used in Serbia
and Bosnia.
The word večer has the form veče in Serbia and most of Bosnia. It’s neuter, but all
case forms are derived from večer- and then it’s feminine.
Colloquial reference to months by ordinals (e.g. deseti mjesec = October) is not used
in Bosnia and Serbia.

50 Because, In Order To, Why: Reasons
Nothing so far was really exciting. The most complicated thing you could say was
something like I wrote two long letters to your brothers. All such sentences were
simple (maybe it was not so simple to create them, but they are nevertheless called
simple).
Now, the exciting things: how to express things or events that caused something?
The simplest way to indicate cause of something is by using the preposition zbog.
It’s used when cause is a thing, or an event expressed by a noun. Words after it
should be in the genitive case. It corresponds to English because of and due to:
TravaN je mokraN zbog kišeG. The grass is wet because of the rain.
(It’s not hard to remember, since the English of often corresponds to the Croatian
genitive case.)
If something was not caused by a thing, but a whole event, normally expressed by a
sentence, there’s a small difference. (There’s a difference in English too, where you
have to use because, and not because of.) In such cases, the main way is to use the
conjunction jer:
TravaN je mokraN jer je padala kišaN. The grass is wet because it has rained.
The word jer and words after it are a kind of sentence-within-a-sentence. There will
be a verb inside, a subject, possibly an object and who knows what. Such sub-
sentences are usually called clauses (more precisely, this kind is called reason
clause). I will often emphasize clauses by enclosing them in square brackets [...].
(I called jer a conjunction, and zbog a preposition due to tradition – you will find such
classification in other grammar books. However, it’s often hard to tell if a word is a
preposition, a conjunction or something else. What is important for you is how to
use a word and not how it is classified.)
The word order in clauses is the same as in any other sentence; the word jer holds
the first position, so all the second-position words must come right after it.
Therefore, there are two "second positions" in one sentence, both filled in our
example by the word je²:
TravaN¹ je² mokraN [jer¹ je² padala kišaN].
A reason clause can be in any tense, for example in the present tense, or in the
future tense, if you predict that something will happen:
TravaN je mokraN jer pada kišaN. The grass is wet because it's raining.
Uzeo sam kišobranA jer će padati kišaN. I took an umbrella because it's going to rain.
Another, less often used way is to use zato što instead of jer; everything else is the
same:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 50 Because, In Order To, Why: Reasons
290 / 600

moći pres-1
2 | 1 | moći pres-2
2 | 1 | moći pres-2
2
2
TravaN je mokraN zato što je² padala kišaN. (the same meaning)
There’s one more way, using zbog toga što. (Colloquially, you will also hear and
sometimes read zato jer in such sentences.)
All such sentences express reasons that caused something: it rained and it made the
grass wet. However, it’s possible that somebody is doing something because he or
she wants something to happen later (or, not to happen). In English, such sentences
look like these:
(1) I took an umbrella [so (that) I don’t get wet].
(2) I need ten kunas [to buy a sandwich].
(3) I’m learning Croatian [so (that) I can talk to Ana].
(4) I’ll buy you a new phone [so (that) you can call me].
The sentences above contain clauses in square brackets known as purpose clauses.
English here uses a variety of conjunctions (to, in order to, so that, so). Croatian is
way simpler – it just uses one word: da. These four sentences translate as:
(1) Uzeo sam kišobranA da se ne smočim.
(2) Trebam deset kunaG da kupim sendvičA.
(3) Učim hrvatskiA da mogu razgovarati s AnomI.
(4) Kupit ću tiDL novi telefonA da meA možeš zvati.
We have here used the perfective member of the verb pair (because we want
something done and accomplished, not just going to shops and checking stuff):
kupovati (kupuje) ~ kupiti buy
Now, there’s a special rule: verbs after da should be in the present tense only.
Perfective verbs are often used (e.g. in sentences #1 and #2). The verb smočiti is a
perfective verb that can be used with an object (in A) meaning make wet, but with
se² it means get wet. (There are many verbs like that.)
As with jer and zato što, any fixed-position words come right after da, e.g. check the
sentence #4:
Kupit¹ ću² tiDL² novi telefonA [da¹ meA² možeš zvati].
There’s another special rule: instead of the verb biti (je² +), the potential verb (bude)
must be used in purpose clauses:
Trebaš kaputA [da tiDL ne bude hladno]. You need a coat so that you don’t get
cold.
In such sentences, the potential verb (bude) is often translated as English get or
become. To see that the verb was replaced, compare the sentence above to the
desired outcome; obviously, nije was replaced by ne bude:
Nije tiDL hladno. You are not cold.
Sometimes, you’ll hear and read the conditional instead of the present tense in
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 50 Because, In Order To, Why: Reasons
291 / 600

purpose clauses. Keep in mind that in such clauses, both present and conditional
imply future, possible events and states. The conjunction da has other roles as well,
it’s one of the most used words in Croatian.
There’s an interesting phrase za slučaj da, followed by a reason, expressed usually in
the present tense (perfective verbs allowed), indicating precaution, as English just in
case:
Uzet ću kišobranA, za slučaj da pada kišaN. I’ll take an umbrella, just in case it rains.
If you want to express general precaution, like English just in case followed by
nothing specific (or like to be on the safe side), use za svaki slučaj:
Zatvorit ću prozorA, za svaki slučaj. I’ll close the window, just in case.
While reason and purpose clauses cannot be rearranged, and usually aren’t
separated by a comma, the precautions can be placed before the main sentence,
and usually are separated by a comma:
Za svaki slučaj, zatvorit ću prozorA. (the same meaning)
Next, you can use just zato to refer to something said before as a reason; it’s
common to start a sentence with that word:
Padat će kišaN. It will rain.
Zato trebam kišobranA. That’s why I need an umbrella.
There’s one more way to express purpose, and it’s used only with verbs of motion.
When you go somewhere to “get”, “take” or “pick up” somebody or something, the
common way to express it is simply by po¨ + A:
Vraćam se po novčanikA. I’m going back to get my wallet.
Let’s summarize ways of expressing reasons in Croatian:
Expressing reasons in Croatian
because of...
zbog
+ thing in G
because...
jer
zato što
+ clause in any tense
(in order) to...
so (that)...
da
+ clause in pres. tense
biti (je² +) → (bude)
just in case...
za slučaj da + clause
just in case
za svaki slučaj
(motion) to get...
po¨
+ thing in A
(In the Standard Croatian, there’s another conjunction: radi. It’s similar to zbog, but
it expresses a purpose instead of cause. Very few people maintain such distinction
and both are used interchangeably in real life, meaning just a cause.)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 50 Because, In Order To, Why: Reasons
292 / 600

3f A
If you want to ask why something happened (or something is done) start a question
with the word zašto why ®. As with other question-words, no rearrangement of the
rest is needed:
Zašto je trava mokraN? Why is the grass wet?
— Zbog kišeG. Because of the rain.
— Jer je padala kišaN. Because it has rained.
— Jer pada kišaN. Because it’s raining.
— Pada kišaN. It’s raining.
You usually answer just with the cause, preceded by the right conjunction, as above
(conjunctions can be even left out). The same goes for purpose clauses and
precautions, but da cannot be left out in any case:
Zašto trebaš deset kunaG? Why do you need ten kunas?
— Da kupim sendvičA. To buy a sandwich.
Zašto si zatvorio prozorN? Why did you close the window?
— Za svaki slučaj. Just in case.
With po¨ + A:
Zašto se vraćaš? Why are you going back?
— Po kišobranA. To get the umbrella.
There are two more conjunctions that indicate cause. Both are used mostly in
writing; reason clauses using them are normally placed at the beginning:
budući da   
pošto
   since
The conjunction pošto is discouraged (in this role) in formal Croatian. Both
conjunctions are seldom used in answers.
There’s one fine point left. Sometimes, you’ll see, when short time adverbs – such as
sad(a) now, još still and već already – are placed after jer, second position words
come after the adverb. For example:
Ne želim knjiguA [jer¹ već¹ sam juA² pročitao]. I don’t want the book [because
I’ve already read it].
The same can happen with stressed pronouns (e.g. meni).
This is much rarer than the default word order, but don’t panic if you see it once a
while. This is likely done only be some speakers, when they want to specially
emphasize an adverb or a stressed pronoun.

• Examples
Zbog jedne divne crne žene Because of a Gorgeous Black Woman is one of greatest
hits by Croatian singer-songwriter Krunoslav Slabinac (usually known under his
nickname Kićo) from 1970’s. (Note that crna žena in Croatia means just a woman
with black hair and dark eyes. There are very few black women in Croatia in e.g. the
American sense, and if somebody would refer to any, a special term Crnkinja would
be used.)
The chorus contains a number of because constructions, but all are of because of
(i.e. a noun or a noun phrase follows):
Zbog jedne divne crne ženeG
Because of a gorgeous black woman

51 For Days: Approximate Periods, Repetions and
References
There are two very frequent words used to express approximate duration of some
state or action:
dugo for a long time
kratko for a short time
While English uses both for a long time and long in different sentences (e.g. long is
used in questions), Croatian uses only one word in all kinds of sentences. The words
can be placed at any position, but they are often found at the first position. For
example:
Dugo smo gledali filmoveA. We watched movies for a long time.
Kratko je padala kišaN. It rained for a short time.
It’s possible to modify the meaning, using adverbs of intensity (except for malo); you
can also use other intensifiers, such as stvarno really and užasno / strašno terribly:
Jako dugo sam čitao knjiguA. I was reading the book for a very long time.
Stvarno dugo učim hrvatskiA. I’ve been learning Croatian for a really long time.
Then, the instrumental case can be used to express time, when something lasted for
days, for years, and also that something happens on Tuesdays.
Simply put, when something was going on for days, you should use instrumental
plural. You will find the following words useful:
dan day
godina year
mjesec month
sat (N-pl sati) hour
tjedan (tjedn-) ® week
For example:
Čitao sam knjiguA tjednimaI. I was reading the book for weeks.
Čekao sam teA satimaI. I was waiting for you for hours.
Both sentences mean the action or state is over now, that is, you are no longer
reading the book or waiting.
If you want to say that something happens on Fridays, that is, repeats, you should
use weekdays in instrumental singular:
PetkomI igramo nogometA. We play football on Fridays. ®
VikendomI idemo u kinoA. We go to cinema on weekends. ®
The word vikend weekend is of course not a day of week, but has a similar role.
Rough time periods in I-pl can be also used with the verb trajati (traje) last:
PredavanjeN je trajalo satimaI. The lecture lasted for hours.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 51 For Days: Approximate Periods, Repe!ons and References
295 / 600

There’s another, a bit unexpected way to express approximate duration – using
short expressions for a day or two, a week or two and so on: just append the number
two to the noun, e.g. dan-dva. Of course, the number must be in the right gender,
according to the noun it’s after:
Na moruDL ću biti tjedanA-dva. I’ll be at the seaside for a week or two.
RadoviDL će trajati mjesecA-dva. The works will last for a month or two.
Učila sam hrvatskiA godinuA-dvije. I was studying Croatian for a year or two.
(Standard orthography demands they are separated by a hyphen; you’ll also see a
comma or other ways.)
Don’t forget that ongoing periods use the present tense in Croatian, and that they’re
often emphasized with već already, which is often not translated:
AnaN je dugo živjela u SplituDL. Ana lived in Split for a long time. (but not now)
AnaN dugo živi u ZagrebuDL. Ana has lived in Zagreb for a long time. (and still does)
IvanN već godinamaI živi u ZagrebuDL. Ivan has lived in Zagreb for years.
This table summarizes approximate time periods:
adverb
for a short time
kratko
for a long time
dugo
I-pl
for hours
for days
satima
danima
noun-number (A) for an hour or two
for a year or two
sat-dva
godinu-dvije
When asked how long something lasted, you can answer just with approximate
periods:
Koliko dugo si živio tamo? How long did you live there?
— Jako dugo. For a very long time.
— GodinamaA. For years.
Koliko (dugo) ste bili u HrvatskojDL? How long were you in Croatia?
— Kratko. For a short time.
It’s possible to express approximate ‘round-trips’ with na¨ + kratko or dugo, but not
with I-pl (e.g. danima for days). Both are used also with vrijeme, e.g. na dugo
vrijeme:
Odlazim na jako kratko vrijemeA. I’m leaving for a very short time.
Next, it’s possible to say that something happens or is done during something else. If
that ‘something else’ is expressed by a noun (with optional adjectives to describe it),
the most common way is to use:
za vrijeme + G during
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 51 For Days: Approximate Periods, Repe!ons and References
296 / 600

ići
f
putovati
jesti
When something happens or is done in winter (or other season), one option is to use
specific adverbs:
zimi in winter
u proljeće in spring
ljeti in summer
najesen in fall
For example:
Ljeti idemo na moreA. We go to the seaside in summer. (regularly, usually)
The most common way to express roughly when something happened or will
happen is to use combinations of ‘determiners’ (specific adjectives, really) and nouns
for time periods, in A (only A forms are listed, which are identical to N for these
nouns and masculine inanimate gender): ®
jedan one
ovaj this
prošli last
sljedeći next *
svaki each
+
tjedan week ®
mjesec month
Instead of sljedeći, sometimes idući is used, without any difference in meaning.
The noun dan day is a partial exception, explained below.
However, with the feminine nouns godina year and noć f night, it’s more common
to use phrases in G (all words are here listed in G):
jedne one
ove this
prošle last
sljedeće next *
svake each
+
godine year
noći night
Again, sometimes idući is used. There are two specific (and a bit old-fashioned)
adverbs that can be used instead of prošle godine and prošle večeri:
lani last year ®
sinoć last evening
For example:
Ove godineG putujemo u ParizA. We’re traveling to Paris this year.
Prošli tjedanA sam bila bolesnaN. I was sick last week.
Sljedeći mjesecA odlazimo na moreA. We’re leaving for the seaside next month.
There are exceptions to this pattern: the noun dan day, and jutro morning. With
them, adjectives are used in both A and G to get phrases meaning one day, that day,
the first day, etc.:
Jednog danaG smo jeli palačinkeA s medomI. One day we ate pancakes with
honey.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 51 For Days: Approximate Periods, Repe!ons and References
297 / 600

Prvi danA nisam razumio ništaA. I didn’t understand anything the first day.
You can use any way you like, A or G (of course, A is simpler to create). Of course,
you can add additional adjectives to these phrases:
Jednog hladnog zimskog danaG smo samo gledali filmoveA. On one cold winter day,
we just watched movies.
You will sometimes see such long time phrases separated by a comma, after which
word-counting restarts:
Jednog hladnog zimskog danaG, samo smo gledali filmoveA. (the same meaning)
________
® Instead of tjedan, the word nedjelja is used in parts of Bosnia, colloquially in parts
of Croatia, and in the “Ekavian” form nedelja in Serbia; as other feminine time
nouns, it prefers G, so you’ll hear and read svake nedjelje. The word sedmica is also
used in Bosnia and Serbia.
Instead of nogomet and kino, words fudbal and bioskop are used in Serbia and
most of Bosnia for football and cinema.
Use of the accusative case for phrases like prošli mjesec is much more common in
Croatia than in Serbia; in Serbia and parts of Bosnia, the genitive case prevails for all
nouns, regardless of gender.
The adverb lani has an unexpected “Ekavian” form lane in Serbia.

postojati
stati
52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease
There’s a very important group of Croatian verbs having similar forms, so it’s worth
learning them together. It’s also interesting that some of them can behave as
imperfective verbs, despite being basically perfective.
First, the following verb has a simple meaning, just physically stand somewhere.
Unfortunately, it’s a bit irregular:
stajati (stoji) stand
For example:
Stajao sam tamo satimaI. I was standing there for hours.
There’s an important verb similar to it, but more regular:
postojati (postoji) exist
It’s used without objects, just to express that something exists (or not):
JetiN ne postoji. The Yeti doesn’t exist.
You will sometimes hear its present forms stressed as postoji.
Next, there is a verb pair that means stop, come to stand:
stajati (staje) ~ stati (stane) stop
Since this verb implies a kind of motion (that’s coming to stand), it’s used with
destinations, while stajati (stoji) is a static verb, therefore it’s usually used with
locations:
Stao sam pred vrataA. I stood in front of the door. (pred¨ + A = dest.)
Stajao sam pred vratimaI. I was standing in front of the door. (pred¨ + I = loc.)
This verb has one more meaning: fit into (e.g. vine into a bottle, clothes into a
suitcase). In that meaning, the perf. verb is common in the present tense as well,
including the true present (that is, things going on at the very moment of speaking):
HlačeN ne stanu u koferA. The pants don’t fit into the suitcase. ®
Be careful: this means only fit into physically, it doesn’t cover the meaning belong
(e.g. fit into the crowd): for the second meaning, use the verb pripadati belong.
Furthermore, the verb stati (stane) needs destinations, including this use.
The past form of the perf. verb, in neuter singular, is used in a phrase:
DL + biti (je² +)° + stalo (+ do¨ G) = DL cares (about G)
This phrase is a way to express that someone cares about somebody or something.
Here the word stalo has no past meaning: it’s used as an adverb, like žao or
dosadno. The verb biti is here impersonal, and can be in any tense:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease
299 / 600

3m/n
Nije muDL stalo. He doesn’t care.
AniDL je° stalo do GoranaG. Ana cares about Goran. / Goran matters to Ana.
AniDL je bilo stalo do meneG. Ana cared about me.
Compare it with e.g. Ani je bilo drago – it’s exactly the same structure, apart from
the do¨ + G.
The infinitive (and consequently, past forms) of the impf. verb stajati (staje) are
exactly the same as for the verb meaning stand, but since the impf. verbs are mostly
used in the present tense, confusion is rare.
The pair stajati (staje) ~ stati (stane) is likely the most important pair in Croatian,
since there’s a number of very common and important verbs derived from it:
nastajati (nastaje) ~ nastati (nastane) come to exist
nestajati (nestaje) ~ nestati (nestane) disappear
ostajati (ostaje) ~ ostati (ostane) stay, remain
postajati (postaje) ~ postati (postane) become
prestajati (prestaje) ~ prestati (prestane) stop (doing something), cease
The perf. verbs in the pairs above are sometimes stressed as nastati (nastane) – the
‘western’ stress is on a different syllable in present forms. (The stress never moves
to the negation in the present tense of these pairs.)
If you are confused by similarity of impf. and perf. verbs listed above, there’s one
simple difference: the impf. verbs have a -j- in all their forms – infinitive, present,
past, some forms I haven’t explained yet – and the perf. verbs never have it in any
form.
The verb pair derived with o- has come curious properties. The perf. verb ostati
(ostane / ostane) behaves a bit like an imperfective verb. For example, it can be
used with time periods, unlike other perf. verbs. Compare:
Ostao je u bolniciDL dva sata24. He remained in hospital for two hours.
Čekao je u bolniciDL dva sata24. He waited in hospital for two hours.
You cannot do it with e.g. napisati (napiše) perf. write. Therefore, the impf. verb
ostajati (ostaje) is basically used in the present tense only.
Otherwise, the verb is very similar to English stay and remain: you can stay
somewhere, something, with someone, etc. It’s a very versatile verb:
Ostao je kod kućeG. He stayed at home.
Ostali su zajedno. They stayed together.
The past form of the perf. verb is used as a real quantity adjective (as with other
past forms used as adjectives, the form with -i, ostali is the basic form):
Ostalo tijestoN je u frižideruDL. The remaining pastry is in the fridge.
It’s often used as a pronoun as well; in the same way as other adjectives, e.g. sav
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease
300 / 600

postajati
postajati
postajati | 1pl
1
(sv- +), the neuter singular forms are used for things, and masc. plural forms for
people:
OstaliN će doći sutra. The rest (of them) will come tomorrow.
OstaloN će doći sutra. The rest (of it) will come tomorrow.
These two adjectives-used-as-pronouns are often used together, meaning all the
rest:
Svi ostaliN su u dvorištuDL. ‘All others are in the yard.’
Sve ostaloN je u kutijiDL. All the rest is in the box.
The verb pair derived with po- is similar to biti (je² +) be – it corresponds to English
become or to English get with adjectives:
Postat će tataN. He’ll become a dad.
Postajem gladnaN. I’m becoming/getting hungry. (impf., I = female)
This verb, like be, usually uses objects in N (e.g. tata dad is obviously in N)! It’s also
used with weather expressions and subjective experiences of the environment,
again in the similar way as biti (je² +) be:
Postaje° vruće. It’s getting hot. (impf.)
Postalo je hladno. It became cold.
Postaje° namDL vruće. We’re getting hot. (impf.)
Postalo miDL je hladno. I got/became cold.
The verb pair derived with ne- means roughly disappear, but it also covers meaning
run out, and is also used when e.g. there’s suddenly no electricity, water... or even
beer in the fridge. The prefix comes from negation historically, but it’s always
spelled together with the verb in this case.
What is interesting with this verb pair is that often uses indefinite quantities
(expressed by nouns in G) as their subjects, and consequently, as default for
quantities, the verb behaves as if the subject is neuter singular:
Nestalo je benzinaG. The petrol ran out.
Nestalo je strujeG. The electricity is out.
The same thing can be expressed also with the negative existential:
Nema° više benzinaG. There’s no more petrol.
Nema° više strujeG. The electricity is out.
The verb pair derived with pre- is usually used with impf. verbs in infinitive, or with
some noun that can "last" and then "stop" (e.g. rain, road, danger):
KišaN je prestala. The rain stopped.
GoranN je prestao plakati. Goran stopped crying.
You’ll often see the base pair used in the first construction (just a subject) with the
same meaning:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease
301 / 600

KišaN je stala. The rain stopped.
The opposite meaning – begin, start – is expressed with an unrelated verb pair (the
perf. verb has a bit unexpected -n- in present!):
počinjati (počinje / počinje) ~ početi (počne) start, begin
The verb pair is used in the same way as the pre- pair. For example:
KišaN je počela. The rain started.
GoranN je počeo plakati. Goran started crying.
Such verbs that indicate start or end points are often called phase verbs. Pay
attention that with these verbs, only impf. verbs in inf (e.g. plakati) are used. There’s
no accomplishment, the focus in on starting or stopping an activity.
The following verb pair has a very simple meaning:
ustajati (ustaje) ~ ustati (ustane) stand up
The following verbs follow exactly the same pattern:
pristajati (pristaje) ~ pristati (pristane) consent, agree
odustajati (odustaje) ~ odustati (odustane) give up
The first verb is often used with content clauses (I will introduce them in a short
while), or with na¨ + A. The second verb uses od¨ + G to describe what you’re giving
up:
AnaN je pristala na ručakA. Ana has agreed to have a lunch.
AnaN je odustala od izletaG. Ana has given up on the excursion.
The following verb pairs have opposite meanings:
sastajati (sastaje) se² ~ sastati (sastane) se² get together, meet
rastajati (rastaje) se² ~ rastati (rastane) se² split, separate
While English usually makes derived verbs with detached prepositions, Croatian
always uses prefixes. You will notice that often these two Croatian verb prefixes
match the English prepositions used to derive verb meaning:
ra- / ras- / raz- apart
s- / sa- together
Then, there’s a verb derived with nedo- (again, the ne is always spelled together).
It’s already covered in 23 I’m Cold: Basic Impressions. There’s no perf. verb
corresponding to it.

There are more verb pairs derived from this base pair, e.g. with zao- meaning lag,
fall behind and so on.
A final remark: the perfective verb stati (stane) is sometimes – mostly in literature
and in speech, in parts of Dalmatia, and some rural areas – used as a phase verb
meaning start. This is quite unexpected, because it otherwise means stand and even
stop! For example, in a novel written by Marija Jurić Zagorka, you can read:
Stao je hodati kolibomI. He started walking over the hut.
I don’t use it, but be prepared to hear and read it from time to time.

® In Serbia and Bosnia, instead of hlače f pl. pants, trousers, pantalone f pl. is used.
• Examples
Haustor (meaning entryway, doorway, in inland parts of Croatia, from German),
fronted by Darko Rundek, was a very popular band from Zagreb, still very popular in
many former parts of Yugoslavia. This song, Bi mogo da mogu Could if I could (a
construction yet unexplained) is from 1988:
Uvijek s malo, premalo paraG
Always with little, too little cash
Kad upale se svjetlaN, ode dimN
When lights turn on, smoke leaves
A mirisN noćiG
And the smell of night
  opet postaje stvaranN
  is becoming real again
(Darko Rundek, Srđan Gulić)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease
303 / 600

The noun pare f pl. is a colloquial word for money. The verb upaliti («) is a perfective
verb meaning ignite, turn on. Here nobody has turned on the lights, they ignited,
turned on, so a se² must be used.
The word a¨ in the third line will be explained in the following chapters: it’s another
word for and. We have the verb postajati (postaje) become in that line, and, as
expected, what it becomes is again in N (stvaran real, which agrees with miris, a
masculine inanimate noun).
Ko mnogo putaG do sada
Like many times before
OnN sanja
He’s dreaming
Kako beskrajno pada...
Of falling endlessly...
The word ko is a colloquial form of kao as, like.
The lines on sanja kako beskrajno pada contain a content clause, which will be
explained in 59 Knowing and Telling: Content and Noun Clauses. It literally means
he’s dreaming that he’s endlessly falling.
Bilo je rano jutroN tada
It was early morning then
  kad je ostavio sveA
  when he left everything
Čulo se samo kako pticeN pjevaju
Only birds singing could be heard
Onda je stajao još dugo
Then he was standing for a long time
  s druge straneG uliceG
  on the other side of the street
The verb pair ostavljati ~ ostaviti leave (e.g. keys) was introduced in previous
chapters. It’s, of course, also used to leave everything. Compare it with the second
line, where otići (ode, otišao, otišla) leave, depart is used, because the smoke goes
away, departs.
The line čulo se samo kako ptice pjevaju will be explained later, in 80 Present
Adverbs and Adjectives. It contains also a content clause and a se²-passive, which
will be explained in the following chapters.
The construction s druge strane ulice means literally ‘from the other side of the
street’, but the meaning is on (such use will be explained in 76 Inner, Outer, Step by
Step: More on Space and Time).
You can listen to it on YouTube™. Note that Darko Rundek mostly uses the
standard stress here, despite being from Zagreb.

53 Giving Orders
Croatian has special forms of verbs used to give orders: imperatives (imper for
short). In English, the imperative is just a verb without a personal pronoun:
Wait for me!
In Croatian, there’s a special verb form (it’s quite similar to the present tense forms):
Čekaj meA! Wait for me!
Imperatives exist only for the 2nd person singular and plural (I can give orders to
you) and for the 1st person plural (I can give orders to us).
If you know the imper-2 form, it’s very easy to get other forms – all are regular –
and it’s easy to get the imper-2 if you know its pres-3pl:
pres-3pl
imper-2
imper-1pl
imper-2pl
-u, -e
-i
-imo
-ite
-ju, (-je) ®
-j
-jmo
-jte
-ku
-ci
-cimo
-cite
For example, here are the imper-2 forms of some frequent verbs:
gledati watch → gledaj
učiti learn → uči
pisati (piše) write → piši
ići (ide, išao, išla) go → idi
The imperative gledaj watch! is often shortened to just gle. There’s one completely
irregular imperative:
biti (je² +) be → budi
Most verbs have stress in imperatives like in the infinitive. Verbs in -iti which, in the
standard stress scheme, shift their stress left in the present tense, don’t do it in the
imperative, and that distinguishes some forms which are equal in writing:
govoriti («) speak →
govori = pres-3
govori = imper-2
(Std. stress scheme!)
Only a handful of otherwise ‘irregular’ verbs have the pres-3pl ending in -ku. Such
commonly used verbs are:
reći (reče, rekao, rekla) perf. tell → reci
tući (tuče, tukao, tukla) beat, smack → tuci
vući (vuče, vukao, vukla) pull → vuci
The verb reći is almost never used in the present tense, but its imperative is often
used:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 53 Giving Orders
306 / 600

1
1
1
Reci miA, gdje si bio? Tell me, where have you been?
Other very often used imperatives are (I have listed only their imper-2 forms):
čekaj! wait!
dođi! come here!
pazi! take care!
stani! stop!
As you can see, imperative forms of perfective verbs are often used (more details
below).
Only a few verbs end in -je in pres-3pl; some get imperatives on -j, others on -ji:
bojati (boji) paint → boji ®
brojati (broji) count → broji ®
bojati (boji) se² be afraid → boj se²
(The verb brojati (broji) is very common, although the Standard Croatian has a
slightly different verb brojiti. The same goes for bojati (boji) – the Standard, but
seldom used verb is bojiti. For more details, check 58 Colloquial and Formal.)
For verbs that end in -je in pres-3pl, the imper-2 form is listed in the Core Dictionary.
Now, there’s a problem: should you use an impf. or a perf. verb when you use
imperatives? If we want someone to finish something, perf. verbs are used:
Pročitaj knjiguA. Read the book. (perf. = the whole book)
If it’s not important that someone reads the whole book (e.g. the important part is
somewhere in the middle), then the impf. verb is used:
Čitaj knjiguA. Read the book.
Impf. verbs are also often used to express that someone should do some activity
regularly, or when the object is very generic:
Čitajte knjigeA. Read books.
Peri zubeA svaki danA. ‘Wash’ your teeth every day. (i.e. brush)
In the last example (with teeth) the perf. verb could be also used, but using impf.
verbs is more common. Impf. verbs are also used when we want somebody to do
something repeatedly, while perf. verbs usually imply that something should be done
once:
Baci miA loptuA. Throw me the ball. (perf. = once)
Bacaj loptuA. Throw the ball. (impf. = one to many times)
Impf. verbs are sometimes used in imperatives to indicate that we want someone to
start something immediately.®
Negation (don’t sing!) can be constructed in two ways. First, by simply putting the
usual word ne¨ in front of the imperative:
Ne čekajte meA! Don’t wait for me! (pl.)

The stress, in the standard scheme, can shift to ne¨, but never for verbs that have
any underline (in my notation), and additionally never for these common verbs:
graditi build
ići (ide, išao, išla) go
lagati (laže) lie, tell lies
nositi carry, wear
pisati (piše) write
skakati (skače) jump
vikati (viče) yell
voziti drive
Additionally, verbs that have an additional vowel in pres-3 which is underlined, don’t
shift the stress too; common ones are:
prati (pere) wash
zvati (zove) call
In the ‘western’ scheme, stress shifts to ne¨ only in very short verbs (one syllable in
imper-2) e.g. ne daj don’t give (from dati perf. give). Consequently, you’ll sometimes
see non-standard spellings such as nedaj and like.
For instance, this sign is written above the door of a building in Zagreb, saying don’t
park – the verb is parkirati («) park – and the hyphen between words is likely just
decorative:
This works for imperfective verbs, but not for most perfective verbs.
Another method is to use a special negative imperative verb and the infinitive of the
verb. This special verb has only imperatives: its imper-2 is nemoj. This works for all
verbs:
Nemojte meA čekati! Don’t wait for me! (pl.)
Nemoj otići! Don’t leave!
If you were careful, you could see that the combination ne¨ + verb behaves as one
unit (as usual) so mi², me² etc. come right after it, but nemoj is a word on its own
and words that want to be at the second position come right after it (but the verb in
infinitive cannot come before nemoj).
If a verb requires the word se², it’s required in imperative as well:
Ne boj se! Don’t be afraid!
As in English, there’s no special imperative form for the 3rd person, but you can use
neka + verb in present, similar to English let, but without changes in case (English
changes case: it’s not let she but let her):
Neka uđe. Let him/her come in.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 53 Giving Orders
308 / 600

Neka AnaN vozi. Let Ana drive.
The word neka doesn’t change. It has no connection to neki adj. some. You will
sometimes see and hear it shortened to nek.
What about impf. and perf. verbs in negative imperatives? In many cases, perf.
verbs make no sense in negative imperative. Consider this:
Nemoj pročitati knjiguA. Don’t read the book. (perf. = the whole book)
It would mean: you can read the book, just don’t read the whole book. Makes no
sense. However, it makes sense with some other verbs and objects:
Nemoj jesti kolačeA. Don’t eat the cakes. (impf. = not even a tiny bit)
Nemoj pojesti kolačeA. Don’t eat up the cakes. (perf. = not all of them)
The first sentence means don’t even start eating them, while the second one means
don’t finish the cakes, i.e. leave something. This example is also interesting:
Nemoj bacati knjigeA u smećeA. Don’t throw books into the trash. (impf. = any book,
anytime)
Nemoj baciti knjiguA u smećeA. Don’t throw the book into the trash. (perf. = a
specific instance/book)
(I’ve used nemoj to negate impf. imperatives, but I could have used ne bacaj and ne
jedi in the previous example instead).
The first sentence is about throwing any books, or an unspecified group: you can
throw one today, another the next day, etc. It forbids any throwing. The second one
is about throwing a specific book, which can be thrown only once, and then it’s gone.
In other circumstances, we would use bacati even for a specific object – you can
throw a specific ball many times against a wall.
The rule is: when we do something to a specific object – something irreversible, so it
can be done only once – we use perf. verbs in negative imperative.
For example, we don’t want somebody open a window. Since windows can be open,
and then easily closed, and open again, and we don’t want any of it, we would use
an impf. verb:
Nemoj otvarati prozorA. Don’t open the window. (impf.)
But, for breaking a specific window, we would use a perf. verb, since it’s an
irreversible action (true, windows can be repaired, but it cannot be done
immediately):
Nemoj razbiti prozorA. Don’t break the window. (perf.)
Contrary, if we would speak in general, not about a specific window, or a specific set
of them, we would use an impf. verb:
Nemoj razbijati prozoreA. Don’t break windows. (impf.)

So, this is a way Croatian expresses indefiniteness of objects: by using imperfective
verbs for irreversible actions.
There is another “special verb” – hajde – also having only imperative forms, that is
used to encourage (like c’mon!):
Hajde, dođi! C’mon, come!
Both special verbs can be used on their own in speech:
Nemoj! Don’t!
Hajde! C’mon!
The verb hajde has slightly irregular forms and also has several colloquial forms.
They are all listed here, together with forms of the verb nemoj:
verb
imper-2
imper-1pl
imper-2pl
negative
nemoj
nemojmo
nemojte
encouraging
(colloq.)
hajde
ajde
hajdemo
ajmo
hajde
ajde
There’s another verb that can be used colloquially to encourage or strengthen
imperatives:
dati perf. give
This is a perfective verb, and its imperative is used together the imperative of the
main verb. For example:
Daj, čekaj meA! C’mon, wait for me!
There are few exceptions to the rules above, relating to the 1st person plural. For
the verb ići (ide, išao, išla) go, instead of the expected idimo, the present tense form
idemo is used; it applies only to the imper-1pl – other forms are as expected:
imper-2
imper-1pl
imper-2pl
idi
idemo
idite
Furthermore, in colloquial speech, imper-1pl forms aren’t often used. Instead,
hajdemo / ajmo + inf is more common.
However, there’s one imper-1pl frequent in speech and writing: recimo, derived
from the already mentioned reći, meaning of course let’s say (and therefore
suppose, for example etc.).
________
® In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, which completely prevails in Serbia, there’s an
exception in speech from this rule for the “Ekavian” verb razumeti understand: its
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 53 Giving Orders

f
imper-2 a bit unexpected razumi, and so on. However, Standard Serbian insists on
the imper-2 form razumej – according to the above rules – which is followed by very
few people in real life, and a source of endless debates on the Internet about what
is ‘right’. Even very educated public figures in Serbia vowed they will stick with
razumi, regardless of what the official Serbian grammar says.
Standard Serbian insists on the imper-2 forms boj and broj, which are rare in speech,
while Croatian allows boji and broji.
Using impf. verb in imperatives to say that we want somebody to start immediately
doing something seems (to me) less common in Croatia, and more common in
Bosnia and Serbia.
• Examples
The song Sanjaj me Dream of me, was the breakthrough hit by Novi fosili in 1977;
they soon became the most popular Croatian pop group.
The song contains just two parts, both are sung twice. The first part has a
characteristic melody:
Ugasnut će jednom ljubav našaN
Our love will die out once
Negdje drugdje gnijezdaA ćemo sviti
We’ll weave nests somewhere else
UspomeneA odnijet će vrijemeN
Time will carry away memories
U albumuDL ni slikeG neće biti
There won’t be a single picture in the album
Note how the word order is unusual, subject coming last, emphasizing words that
come first, adjectives coming after nouns. The phrase negdje drugdje somewhere
else (lit. ‘somewhere elsewhere’) is very common. The verb sviti (svije) perf. bend,
weave is seldom used, mostly with gnijezdo nest as the object. The verb odnijeti
perf. carry away is irregular; it will be explained in 65 Carry, Bring, Drive: Transport
Verbs.
The rare verb ugasnuti (ugasne) perf. go out, die out was also used in the song used
as an example in 43 And, Or, But: Basic Conjunctions – both are written by the same
person.
The last verse uses ni + G to enhance negation, meaning not even a; such
constructions will be explained in 67 Only, Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion.
The second part, the chorus, has a simple melody. The form sanjaj is an imperative.
The Croatian verb sanjati dream can be used both with A and o¨ + DL, and using just
A if quite common.
The second verse is a time clause (they will be explained in the next chapter). Within
it, there’s za me for me i.e. preposition + short form of pronoun, which is archaic in
speech in most regions (za mene is normally used) but found in poetry. That verse
contain a negative existential phrase with two things in G, linked by ni¨.

The last verse has possessive DL for dreams. Note how again the adjective comes
after ljubav f love. The verse has also present tense of the perfective verb ući (uđe,
ušao, ušla) come in, enter used to express future, which is not standard, but
common in speech in Zagreb and the region around it.
Note how each verse has a pronoun, three have me², the fourth one ti².
Rajko Dujmić, a member of Novi fosili, heard a short poem by Dea Volarić on the
radio and decided to compose a tune. Then a young poet, Volarić wrote this poem
with some others in her notebook as a teenager. A number of them became hits for
Novi fosili.

54 When, While, Until, Before, After
How to say we’ll go to the beach when the rain stops? Like this:
Otići ćemo na plažuA kad kišaN prestane.
This sentence is very similar to the English sentence. We have two parts, linked with
the adverb-used-as-conjunction kad(a) when. As in English, it’s the same word that’s
used to create questions (when...?).
We can use the verb prestati (prestane) perf. stop, cease (introduced in 52 Stand,
Become, Exist, Cease), because we refer to an ‘accomplished change’ (and not to
some process) at an unknown point in time, in the future: it’s definitely not now,
since it’s obviously raining now! It’s the same trick as in English, we use the present
tense but it’s really about some future event. The verb otići (...) perf. go, leave is
also used since we are going to accomplish that, not just start an activity and who
knows if we make the beach...
The word kad(a) starts a time clause. The word order is the same as in other kinds of
clauses: check the previous sentence in the past tense (word positions in
superscripts):
Otišli¹ smo² na plažuA [kad¹ je² kišaN prestala]. We went to the beach
[when the rain stopped].
Such use of the present tense of perfective verbs in clauses to express future events
is widespread in Croatian.
We can use impf. verbs in time clauses too:
Idem tramvajemI kad pada kišaN. I go by tram when it’s raining.
The sentence above has both verbs in the present tense, meaning it’s universal, it
happened and it will happen again. There are no very strict rules how to use tenses
in time clauses, but the main uses are summarized in the following table. It also
indicates that in some cases we can use only one type of verbs (impf. or perf.). We
have to use perf. verbs if we are just waiting for a defined point in time:
past
kad past
happened in
the past
pres.
kad pres.
happened and
will happen

313 / 600

otići past-mpl
otići
doći past-f
Like in purpose clauses, the verb biti (je² +) be is replaced by bude in such time
clauses – but only for future events, instead of the ordinary present forms.
Otišli smo na plažuA kad je bilo toplo. We went to the beach when it
was warm. (past)
Odlazimo na plažuA kad je toplo. We go to the beach when it’s warm. (universal)
Odemo na plažuA kad je toplo. We go to the beach when it’s warm.
(universal)
Otići ćemo na plažuA kad bude toplo. We’ll go to the beach when it gets warm.
(future)
Odlazimo na plažuA kad bude toplo. (immediate future, the same meaning)
In such use, the verb (bude) is usually translated with get, become. English does not
use the future tense in such sentences, but when Croatian time clauses contain an
imperfective verb, future should be used, actually the potential future tense (i.e. one
that uses bude):
Trebat ću kišobranA kad bude padala kišaN. I’ll need an umbrella when it’s raining.
Any future actions (employing impf. verbs) in time clauses must use the potential
future tense in the Standard Croatian. In real life, you’ll often see and hear just the
common future tense as well.
There are six more conjunctions often used in time clauses (some of which consist of
more than one word, but behave as one unit, and some of which have alternative
forms):
dok while (+ until)
prije nego što before
nakon što after
čim as soon
kad god / kadgod whenever
otkad(a) / otkako since
There’s not much to say about conjunctions in the right column – use them instead
of kad(a) and you’ll have a different meaning but everything said above stays the
same. For example:
Radi otkad je došla. She has been working since she arrived.
Croatian uses the present tense for an ongoing action (as usual), and the whole
sentence is much shorter, with the exactly same meaning.
The conjunction dok actually means while. When used with impf. verbs, it
corresponds to English while. The main action lasts while the action in the clause
lasts (which is a period of time, since it has an impf. verb):
Kuham dok su djecaN u školiDL. I cook while children are at school. ®
Negated perfective verbs indicate that some event (still) didn’t happen; we can do
something while it still doesn’t happen, i.e. until it happens. And that’s how Croatian
expresses until:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 54 When, While, Un!l, Before, A_er
314 / 600

postati
naći past-m
doći
Kuham mesoA dok ne postane mekanoN. I cook meat until it gets soft.
The verb postati (postane) perf. become is another verb that can be translated as
get. Actually, we could have used (bude) in this sentence, with almost no difference
in meaning. The conjunction is not dok ne, the verb in the clause is just negated.
Let’s put it to the past tense:
Kuhala sam mesoA dok nije postalo mekanoN. I cooked meat until it got soft.
The action (cooking) lasts until the event in the time clause happens (which is an
instant, since it’s a perf. verb). Also, we don’t use a subject pronoun in the clauses
above, since it’s obvious that the subject is meso meat.
Something important: negation in this case is not an ordinary one: it’s a kind of
limited, almost ‘empty’. It implies that something will be accomplished.
Therefore, words like nikad(a) never, ništa nothing and so are normally not used
in such clauses. Despite the negated verb, the overall meaning of the clause is not
negative.
So it’s normal to say:
Pokušavao sam dok nisam našao neštoA. I tried until I found
something.
This is an apparent exception to the ‘all-negative’ rule. Actually, the sentence implies
that the speaker eventually found something, not nothing. So nešto something will
be used here.
It’s common to emphasize dok (in this role) as sve dok:
Kuhala sam mesoA sve dok nije postalo mekanoN.
Perfective-like verbs, such as vidjeti see are usually understood as plain perfective
verbs, so they can be used only with dok + negation (i.e. meaning until); so, we can’t
say while I see... in Croatian:
Ne znam dok ne vidim. I don’t know until I see.
If something happens when you see something, use kad(a).
You must pay attention when you need prije nego što and nakon što: Croatian
cannot simply reuse prije or poslije with clauses. For example:
(1) I’ll clean the yard before the rain. (before + noun)
(2) I’ll clean the house [before the guests arrive]. (before starts a clause)
Here English just uses the same word to start a clause as the one put before a noun.
The Croatian conjunction is more complicated:
(1) Očistit ću dvorišteA prije kišeG.
(2) Očistit ću kućuA prije nego što dođu gostiN.
The three words prije nego što behave as one unit, and second-place words must
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 54 When, While, Un!l, Before, A_er
315 / 600

doći past-mpl
3m/n
otići
come right after it. The same holds for nakon što, corresponding to both
prepositions nakon and poslije. The word order is illustrated by the sentence #2 put
to the past tense:
Očistio sam² kućuA prije nego što su² došli gostiN.
Sometimes, when perfective verbs are used after prije nego što, you will find
‘empty’ negations:
Zaustavi gaA prije nego što ne bude prekasno. (sometimes) Stop him before
it’s too late. (or: it gets)
This is not mandatory (unlike when expressing until), you don’t have to use it, but be
prepared to hear and read such negations once a while, and apply your common
sense then.
Expressing after with nakon što is very similar:
Očistit ću kućuA nakon što odu gostiN. I’ll clean the house after the guests
leave.
There’s never an ‘empty’ negation with nakon što.
After prije nego što and nakon što you can use any tense. It includes using
perfective verbs in the present tense (as in the examples above) – it refers to the
future then. If you want to express that something happened before something else,
and both things happened in the past (from your point of speaking), both verbs
should be in the past (see the examples above). You can also put both parts in the
future, but with perf. verbs, using the present tense for future events is much more
common.
This compares prepositions with conjunctions (used to start time clauses):
+ noun (in G) + clause
while
za vrijeme
dok (impf.)
until
do¨
dok (perf.) + “neg.”
before
prije
prije nego što
after
poslije
nakon
nakon što
Here “neg.” stands for the mandatory, but ‘empty’ negation. (Of course, nouns can
be with one or more adjectives, with appended nouns in genitive etc.)
You will sometimes hear and read just prije nego without što. It’s not common in
speech, at least mine.
It not uncommon to start a sentence with a time clause; as in English, a comma (,) is
used then:

ići
doći
Čim padne noćN, idemo spavati. As soon the night falls, we are going
to sleep.
Sometimes, you’ll encounter two weird things involving dok. First, in some regions,
colloquially, it’s used also in the meaning when, that is, instead of kad(a).® This is
from the Internet:
Dok dođe vrijemeN ručkaG baš i nisam gladnaN. (colloq., sometimes) When
the lunch time comes, I’m not really hungry.
(The baš i is here a way to say really. There’s no comma: in colloquial writing,
commas are often left out.)
Second, the mandatory negation after dok + perf. verb to express until is... not
100% mandatory. It can be (rarely) left out. It’s not really clear if there’s a small
difference in meaning or not; I don’t think there is.
These two weird things collide. Due to the first thing, dok + perf. verb cound mean
when; due to the second thing, until. You’ll have to apply your common sense if you
hear or read a weird sentence with dok.®
________
® Instead of kuhati, the form kuvati is used in Serbia, and in parts of Bosnia and
Croatia (however, it’s not standard in Croatia).
Leaving the ‘empty’ negation out after dok seems to be more common in Serbia;
however, using dok in meaning when is known only in Croatia, and likely mostly in
the northern regions. It seems that people who use dok as when never leave the
‘empty’ negation out when expressing until, which could explain why leaving the
‘empty’ negation out is less common in Croatia.
• Something Possibly Interesting
The ‘empty’ negation of perfective verbs after dok is also called ‘pleonastic’,
‘expletive’, ‘paratactic’, and maybe there are more weird names. (In this case,
‘expletive’ doesn’t mean vulgar!) You’ll see in the following chapters there’s a
number of constructions where such negation is used, mostly with perfective verbs
in various clauses.
Various ‘empty’ negations – often in expressions which translate to English until –
are a feature of many languages, including French, Spanish, Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
Arabic, and of course, languages closely related to Croatian, such as Russian.
It’s interesting that Russian has future tense only for impf. verbs. When you want to
express future for perf. verbs, you simply use their present tense forms. Confusingly,
present tense forms of perf. verbs are often listed in Russian grammars as ‘future
tense’. This is an oversimplification: of course, they can express everyday events and
similar things.

• Examples
A song by late singer-songwriter Arsen Dedić, Takvim sjajem može sjati It can shine
with such radiance, contains a number of time clauses (I’ve put them in brackets
[...]). In most of them, the verb (bude) is used.
The first verses contain some archaic words: ljeto here means year, and bješe is the
so-called imperfect tense, which is extremely rare today, so rare I don’t know other
forms. It was simply another past tense, no real difference in meaning. Also, the
adjective naš is placed after the noun, which is often done in poetry, but almost
never in speech.
Ljubav našaN ranih ljetaG
Our love of early years
za obojeA bješe jadN
was misery for both
sad je pravaN, sad je svetaN
now it’s true, now it’s sacred
[kada više nisam mladN]
[when I’m not young anymore]
(Arsen Dedić)
The adjective pravi corresponds to many related English meanings: correct, true,
right; it will be explained in detail in 79 You’re Wrong and Other Phrases.
The following verses have a similar structure:
Ove bitkeN, ove raneN
These battles, these wounds
otkrit će ljepotu svuA
will uncover all beauty
[kada budu stvari davneN]
[when they become things long gone]
[kad ne budu više tu]
[when they aren’t here anymore]
The second verse uses the perfective verb otkriti (otkrije) perf. uncover, discover.
The last two verses have (bude) instead of biti (je² +) be.
In the following verse, što te muče is a short relative clause, literally which bother
you; such clauses will be introduced later.
Ova jutraN što teA muče
These mornings bothering you
Pružit će i tebiDL sveA
will offer everything to you as well
[kada sutra bude jučer
[when tomorrow becomes yesterday
a tiN budeš koN zna gdje]
and you get who knows where]
In the second verse, there is a perfective verb from the pair with various meanings:
pružati ~ pružiti stretch, extend; offer
This verb pair basically means extend, stretch (e.g. legs) but also offer (e.g. help,
support) to someone (expressed in DL, of course). The last two verses have again
(bude).
In the last verse, ko is a colloquial form of tko who.

55 More Prepositions
It might be a surprise to you that in Croatian, most prepositions require nouns in
genitive.
There are various spatial prepositions that indicate closeness; they are shown here
from the closest to the most distant:
do¨ + G by
uz¨ + A next to
oko¨ + G around
pored¨ + G beside
kod¨ + G at, by
blizu + G near
Not all prepositions listed above use the genitive case, but are listed here because
they belong to this group. The word blizu is not strictly a preposition, as it can be
used on its own.
There a very interesting preposition that indicates (when used with DL, you’ll see
other uses later!) that a motion is along surface, broadly understood:
po¨ + DL on the surface of
For example, if somebody (e.g. a child) is crawling on the floor – Croatian has the
verb puzati (puže) – you would use this preposition to indicate space where the
motion happens. It’s not a direction (you don’t indicate what the goal is) but a kind
of location:
DijeteN puže po poduDL. The child is crawling on the floor.
The preposition na¨ + DL is not used when you describe motion.
Another classic use of this preposition with DL is to describe a motion that’s
constantly against some surface, e.g. jumping or banging:
GoranN skače po krevetuDL. Goran is jumping on the bed.
The difference between na¨ + A and po¨ + DL when expressing motion can be nicely
illustrated with the following sentences:
Trčim na plažuA. (A) I’m running to the beach.
Trčim po plažiDL. (DL) I’m running on the beach.
The first sentence expresses destination, the second location (as a surface) where
the entire motion happens. Another common use of po¨ + DL is when someone is
traveling across a country, i.e. visiting many parts (regardless of the country not
perceived as a surface):
Putujemo po EuropiDL. We’re traveling across Europe. ®
There’s another preposition:
prema + DL towards / according to
This preposition is used to describe orientation or direction, not a destination, e.g.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 55 More Preposi!ons
320 / 600

when you tell someone to move two steps in the direction of something, or you turn
towards something (which can be a cardinal direction).
It’s also used to express ‘according to’, either a person or something else:
OvoN nije prema pravilimaDL. This is not according to the rules.
Prema kartiDL, imamo još dva kilometra24 do vrhaG. According to the map, we have
two kilometers more to the top.
Together with the generic pronoun to, it’s used in a frequent phrase to start a
sentence:
Prema tome,... ‘According to that,...’ = Therefore,...
Some nouns have specific meanings with prepositions. One of most common is red.
This noun has one generic meaning: order. For instance, the TV series Law & Order is
translated as Zakon i red.
A common phrase that includes a preposition and this word is:
u reduDL alright, OK
This is, for example, used in a frequent phrase:
SveN je u reduDL. Everything is OK.
However, there’s a derived meaning of this noun: an order of waiting, either a
physical waiting line, or a waiting list. When you are waiting and someone else is
also waiting, there are specific meanings with prepositions u¨ and na¨:
u¨ + red (DL / A) waiting, in line
na¨ + red (DL / A) at the front, about to be served
I wrote (DL / A) to remind you that the usual distinction of location (DL) vs.
destination (A) applies here as well, no matter how metaphorical the place is. For
instance, when you want to tell someone that it’s his or her turn to be served, you
should say (politely, or to a group):
ViN ste na reduDL. You’re next.
(The Croatian expression is also used when people are talking turns, it corresponds
to It’s your turn. then.). However, there’s another way (a bit rarer) to express this,
which used ‘rotated’ cases, now one who is about to be served is expressed with na¨
+ A:
RedN je na vasA. (the same meaning)
Another example, if you ask who should be served (you can hear it in shops, when
more than one person is waiting at one counter):
TkoN je na reduDL? Who’s next?
There’s yet another preposition which is used in waiting:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 55 More Preposi!ons
321 / 600

preko reda bypassing the line
There’s another often used preposition:
o¨ + DL about
It’s mostly used with the following verbs:
brinuti (brine) se² care
ovisiti depend
pisati (piše) write
razgovarati («) talk
For example (recall, you must use a stressed pronoun with a preposition):
SveN ovisi o njemuDL. Everything depends on him.
However, with the verb misliti think, this preposition is not used in the way you
maybe expect. It’s rather:
misliti
    + na¨ + A think about
    + A + o¨ + DL have opinion on
For example:
Ne mislim na njuA. I’m not thinking about her.
There are more ‘quasi-locations’. One example, which corresponds to an English
phrase, is:
u obliku + G in the shape of
(The word oblik (oblik-) is an exception to stress-shift rules.) For example:
Imam kutijuA u oblikuDL srcaG. I have a heart-shaped box.
Another interesting construction uses two prepositions, and can be roughly
translated as unlike:
za razliku od + G unlike X, Y
It’s usually used to contrast subject of the sentence with something else. An
example will make it clearer:
Za razlikuA od AustrijeG, HrvatskaDL ima moreA. Unlike Austria, Croatia has the sea.
There’s something interesting when prepositions are used with indefinite pronouns
and adverbs. When they are used with ones starting with ni-, the prefix ni- gets
detached and becomes a separate word that is placed before the preposition. As
you can see from the table, this doesn’t happen for other indefinite pronouns, and it
doesn’t happen when the preposition bez¨ without is used – something unexpected
happens then:

The same holds for e.g. nitko nobody and adverbs like nikuda. However, in
colloquial communication, the ‘split pronoun rule’ is not really respected, so you’ll
hear and see od ničega quite often.

56 Desires and Demands
Let me explain how to say I want her to dance in Croatian, and more. In such
expressions, Croatian has a completely different approach than English, and frankly,
Croatian approach is simpler.
English is a subject-oriented language. You have to express a subject even when it
does not make any sense (e.g. it rains). When you express desires, you basically
express wishes about someone or something (don’t worry, it will get really clear
soon). Croatian is quite verb-oriented – subjects are usually omitted, they cannot be
expressed when they would make no sense; when you express wishes, you express
that you want something to happen.
This sounds really abstract, but an example will make it perfectly clear:
X = onaN she
Y = (onaN) pleše she dances
Now, how to express that you want X and then Y in English? The sentence I want X
just takes an object you wish (X), and if it’s a pronoun, it goes to the object case (the
equivalent of the accusative case in Croatian):
I want X = I want her.
However, if you want Y, you have to rephrase the action, you still want her, but to
do something:
I want Y = I want her to dance.
From she dances we arrived to her to dance, quite a transformation in English.
Spanish is verb-oriented, like Croatian, but it requires a special form of verb
(subjunctive) after que in desired or imagined events... Croatian is way simpler:
Želim njuA. I want her.
Želim da (onaN) pleše. I want her to dance. (lit. da + she dances)
The first sentence uses exactly the same construction as in English, but the second
one is completely different. It uses the conjunction da and then simply what you
want to happen!
Verbs after da obviously don’t refer to anything going on right now: they are just
desired events and processes. Therefore, you can freely use perf. verbs, and you
have to do so, if you want something to get accomplished:
Želim da pročitaš knjiguA. I want you to read the book. (lit. ‘that you read the book
completely’)
The part starting with da is again a clause – a desire clause, very similar to purpose
clause (introduced in 50 Because, In Order To, Why: Reasons). The placement of
words follows the same rules:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 56 Desires and Demands
324 / 600

1 | nazvati
2
Htio¹ sam² [da¹ meA² nazoveš]. I wanted you to call me.
It will likely be some effort to learn such sentences, since their structure is
completely different than in English, and they often use perf. verbs:
Želim da se AnaN vrati. I want Ana to come back. (lit. ‘that Ana comes back’, perf.)
There’s nothing special about negation in this kind of clauses:
Želim da ne pada kišaN. I want it not to rain. (lit. ‘that the rain doesn’t fall’)
Like in purpose clauses, there are two restrictions. First, you can use only the present
tense after da (but you can use perf. verbs). Second, the verb biti (je² +) be is almost
always replaced by (bude), for example:
Toplo je. It’s warm.
Želim da bude toplo. I want it to be warm.
If you now think that the conjunction da is some special word that introduces
imagined, desired events and processes in Croatian, and that verbs in clauses after it
always come in the present tense, stop immediately.
The word da has about a zillion uses in Croatian, and demands on verbs after da are
determined by the main verb.
For other verbs in the main sentence, there can be other rules for use of verbs in
clauses. There are four main types of clauses in Croatian, regarding behavior of
verbs in them (I’ve invented the names, there are no established names):
Main types of clauses in Croatian
indicative
(the default)
any tense
no perf. verbs in present
(counter)factual
only past or present
no perf. verbs in present
atemporal
only the present tense
perf. verbs allowed
biti (je² +) → (bude)
infinitive ®
(see below!)
only verbs in inf
perf. verbs allowed
no conjunction used
Atemporal-type clauses – like ones with željeti above – express the subject, but not
tense. Infinitive-type clauses cannot even express the subject, and they aren’t really
clauses at all, as words attached to inf can be scattered in the sentence:
Želim piti čajA. I want to drink tea. ®
Željela teA je vidjeti. She wanted to see you.

1 | nazvati
(Such sentences have been covered in 38 Needs, Wishes and Intentions.)
The division above is general, it does not say what conjunction you should use with
indicative and atemporal-type. Reason clauses start with jer and are of indicative-
type. Desire clauses start with da and are of atemporal-type. There are other
clauses that start with da and are of indicative-type, as you’ll see soon.
Also, there are clauses that don’t fall into any of types above, e.g. time clauses with
kad – they have special rules.
There are four more common verbs (actually, two of them are verb pairs) that use
an object and a clause of atemporal-type:
moliti (+ A) (+ DC) kindly ask 
pozivati («) ~ pozvati (pozove) (+ A) (+ DC) call, invite 
slati (šalje) ~ po- (+ A) (+ DC) send
zahtijevati («) (+ od G) (+ DC) demand
The DC stands, of course, for a ‘desire clause’. This is how you politely ask someone
to do something. For example:
Molim teA da zatvoriš prozorA. Please, close the window. (lit. ‘I’m kindly asking
you that you close the window.’)
Pay attention that in all such sentences, the optional object of the main verb is the
same as the subject in the clause: te above is 2nd pers. sing., and zatvoriš is in the
same person (and number).
Another example (unfortunately, I don’t know a simple translation to English):
Poslala sam gaA da kupi kruhA. lit. ‘I’ve sent him that he buys bread.’ ®
You could, in principle, use infinitives with slati, instead of clauses, but it’s quite rare
in speech.
So far we have seen a few atemporal-type clauses: purpose clauses and desire
clauses. Atemporal clauses don’t always have to do anything with purposes or
desires. In fact, there’s a common verb that uses atemporal da-clauses:
čekati wait
The following example illustrates again how Croatian is sometimes simpler than
English: in Croatian you just wait for an event, while in English you wait for someone
to do something (recall, Croatian is verb-oriented):
Čekam da meA nazoveš. I’m waiting for you to call me. (lit. ‘that you call
me’)
In all these sentences, clauses are really objects – and ‘things’, actually events –
therefore you can just ask:
ŠtoA želiš? What do you want?
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 56 Desires and Demands
326 / 600

1 | 3m/n | nazvati
1 | doći
moći pres-1pl
— Da zatvoriš prozorA. lit. ‘That you close the window.’
Answers are usually short, but they must be full clauses, what is desired, i.e. da is
mandatory.
Next, there are a couple of impersonal phrases (with an experiencer in DL) that can
use atemporal clauses:
bitno
stalo
važno
  + DL + biti (je² +)° + da...
They mean it’s important, it matters to DL that... For example:
Bitno miDL je da gaA nazoveš. lit. ‘It’s important to me that you
call him.’
Stalo miDL je da dođeš. lit. ‘I care that you come.’
(The idiomatic use of stalo was introduced in 52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease.)
Of course, you can further strengthen these expressions by putting stvarno really,
jako much, a lot or prilično quite a lot in front of adverbs:
AniDL je jako važno da vratiš novceA. It’s very important to Ana that you return the
money.
(In Croatian, the noun novac (novc-) money is sometimes used in plural as well.)
The phrases, except ones with stalo, can be also used without any experiencer, as
‘objective’, ‘independent’ statements:
Važno je da vratiš novceA. It’s important that you return the money.
Suggestions and permissions use the same grammar: they will be described in 71
Suggestions, Permissions and More Verbs.
However, other superficially similar impersonal expressions, like drago mi je... use a
different type of clauses – indicative-type clauses, so you can use any tense, but not
perf. verbs in the present tense. They will be introduced in 59 Knowing and Telling:
Content and Noun Clauses.
If both a desire clause and a purpose clause are used in the same sentence, the
purpose clause comes last:
Želim [da kupiš mobitelA] [da možemo razgovarati svaki danA]. I
want you to buy a cellphone so that we can talk every day. ®
Finally, there’s a form that extends the rules described above: the verb voljeti
(voli,...) used in conditional. (Hopefully, you recall this verb shifts its meaning a bit in
conditional.) It is a very common way to express wishes. When talking about
possible future things (or even things possible right now) with this verb in
conditional, inf is used ®. Using inf is possible only if someone expresses a desire
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 56 Desires and Demands
327 / 600

piti
about himself or herself. If the subject is different – or there’s none, i.e. it’s
something impersonal – a desire clause must be used:
(1) Voljela bih [imati veliku kućuA]. I’d like [to have a big house]. (I = female)
Voljela bih [da bude sunčano]. I wish [it would be sunny].
So, with wishes for the future, the conditional of voljeti (voli,...) behaves like any
verb expressing desires.
However, this form also allows you to express wishes about the present and the
past, like the English verb wish: wishes that are opposed to the past or the present
state. The conditional is then used with da-clauses in both past and present tense:
(2) Volio bih [da sam toA znao]. I wish [I had known that]. (I = male)
Volio bih [da imamo veću kućuA]. I wish [we had a bigger house].
(The adjective veći bigger is a comparative adjective; comparatives will be
introduced in 63 Bigger and Better: Comparatives).
There’s a very important difference: in English, wishes about the past or present
have time-shifted verbs (had known, had; actually, subjunctive) since they relate to
imaginary states or events. Not so in Croatian: there’s no time-shift for unreal,
imaginary states and actions.
Be careful. Clauses in sentences #2 are not desire clauses: they can be in the past
tense as well, and biti (je² +) be is not replaced by (bude):
Volio bih da je sunčano. I wish it were sunny. (about now: it isn’t)
Clauses of the type #2 are (counter)factual. We’ll meet them again in 70 If I Were:
Conditional Sentences. In the present tense, they look almost the same as desire
clauses, but when using the verb biti (je² +) be the difference is clear – desire clauses
use (bude) instead:
Voljela bih da bude sunčano. I wish it would be sunny. (wish for the future)
In most circumstances, this is a very fine difference. The same construction is
possible with the verbs htjeti (...) and željeti (...) in conditional, but they are
significantly less used so.
________
® There’s a preference in Serbia (actually, the preference is stronger more you go to
southeast) to use atemporal clauses starting with da instead of infinitive clauses:
Želim [da pijem čajA]. I want to drink tea. (Serbia, esp. southeast)
Since da bude is then used instead of biti (due to the the rule in atemporal clauses)
many Serbian grammars consider bude as the pres-3 form of the verb biti be, which
is just absurd, especially from the Croatian standpoint.

In Bosnia, instead of kruh, hljeb is mostly used; in Serbia, it’s “Ekavian” hleb.
In Bosnia and Serbia, mobile phone is called mobilni (changes as an adjective).
In Serbia, there seem to be no difference in volio bih da... vs volio bih + inf, and
infinitives are rare in speech there anyway.
• Examples
The song Korak od sna A step away from dream, is a pop song by Prljavo kazalište
Dirty Theater, a pop-rock band from Zagreb, from 1983. It has fairly simple lyrics:
Jedan tako običan danN
One so ordinary day
jedna djevojkaN
one girl
kojuA jedva da znam
who I barely know
I jedan prazan stanN
and an empty apartment
dovoljan razlogN
a sufficient reason
za još jednu lažA
for one more lie
The construction koju jedva da znam is a relative clause: they will be covered in the
following chapters. The noun laž f lie is another feminine noun not in -a to
remember.
The next verses are simple, note that Croatian never switches case in constructions
like you and me: only ‘you and I’ is possible when in position requiring the N case:
TiN i jaN
You and me
miN smo korakA sad od snaG
we are now a step away from dream
In the expression korak od sna, korak is actually a quantity, and therefore in A
(which is equal to N for this noun). If we would take e.g. sekunda second, the
matching expression would be sekundu od sna.
And then we have a desire clause in the following verses:
Ne želim [da miDL kažeš
I don’t want [you to tell me
o sebiDL sveA]
all about yourself]
jer ovoN nije vrijemeN
because this is not a time
RomeaG i JulijeG
of Romeo and Juliet
moje namjereN nisu lošeN
my intentions aren’t bad
o ne, jaN ne ostavljam
oh no, I don’t leave
nikakve tragoveA
any tracks
(Jasenko Houra)
The preposition o¨ about requires DL, and consequently reflexive DL sebi is used.
The normal word order would be ... sve o sebi, but it’s tweaked here to make it
rhyme.

57 Whose, What Thing and What Like
There are two questions that look quite different in English:
Whose is this book?
What is this book like?
However, they are quite similar in Croatian, since both use question-words that are
really adjectives:
čiji whose
kakav (kakv-) what... like / what kind
The questions above look like this in Croatian:
ČijaN je ova knjigaN? Whose is this book?
KakvaN je ova knjigaN? What is this book like?
Bear in mind that both words change in case, gender and number as any other
adjectives: you can ask questions whose or what...like not only for subjects, but for
any noun in a sentence:
Čiju knjiguA čitaš? Whose book do you read?
You would answer with a possessive adjective, in the right case, matching the case
of the question-word (obviously, the accusative case here), number (singular) and
gender (feminine):
— AninuA. Ana’s.
— TvojuA. Yours.
You can ask questions of type whose X is that. The word to is always in singular then
(recall to su moje knjige):
Čija knjigaN je toN? Whose book is that?
ČijaN je toN knjigaN? (an alternative word order)
— MojaN. Mine.
With kakav (kakv-), it’s possible to ask two kinds of questions – about kind and
impression.
To ask about impressions, use the verb biti (je² +) be. An answer is basically an
adjective standing for a subjective experience:
KakvaN je ta knjigaN? What is that book like?
— Malo dosadnaN. A bit boring.
It’s also possible to ask about kind – then the noun we’re asking is usually placed
immediately after the question-word:
Kakvu knjiguA čitaš? What kind of book are you reading?
— LjubavnuA. A romance book. (lit. ‘Love.’)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 57 Whose, What Thing and What Like
331 / 600

2
Pay attention how both kakvu and ljubavnu are forms that again exactly match the
gender and case of the noun you are asking about – here, feminine singular, the
accusative case – as obvious from their endings!
Of course, it’s also possible to ask:
Kakva knjigaN je toN? What kind of book is that?
KakvaN je toN knjigaN? (an alternative word order)
— LjubavnaN. lit. ‘Love.’
Colloquially, it’s possible to ask about personal opinions by adding the person in DL
(recall 23 I’m Cold: Basic Impressions):
KakvaN tiDL je knjigaN? (colloq.) lit. ‘What is the book like to you?’
— DosadnaN. Boring.
This question would be best translated how you like the book. As you can see,
superficially similar words (ta, to, ti²) produce completely different meanings.
Finally, it’s possible to ask what book. Pay attention, not simply what (answers could
be a book, a magazine, newspapers etc.), but what book.
For questions of type what book, what car, Croatian uses a specific question-
adjective:
koji (a bit specific forms) what... / which
Its forms basically follow the same pattern as moj my – there are longer and shorter
forms. You can in principle use both forms, but longer, regular ones – kojeg, kojem
– are much more common, and standard in Croatia:®
gender
 N
 A
 DL
 G
 I
fem.
koja
koju
kojoj
koje
kojom
neut.
koje
= N
kojem(u)
kom(e) ®
kojeg(a)
kog(a) ®
kojim
masc.
(not p/a) koji
= N
masc.
(p/a)
= G
(Forms for the fem. gender are, as usual, plain adjective forms, they are listed here
just for completeness sake.)
Some forms also have optional vowels at their end. There’s absolutely no difference
between kojeg and kojega, and both forms are used (unlike common adjectives,
where such vowels are used only occasionally in writing). For instance:
Koju knjiguA čitaš? What book are you reading?
(you would answer with the title of the book)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 57 Whose, What Thing and What Like
332 / 600

Croatian makes no difference between such questions and which-questions (asking
what item from a given selection). In fact, the word koji is often translated as which
and I personally have problems when to use what and when which in English, since
my native language has no such distinction!
Croatian has no pronoun matching the English one. You can answer such questions
using the determining adjective only (in the right case, gender and number, of
course):
Koju jabukuA želiš? Which apple do you want?
— ZelenuA. The green one.
Koje vinoA želiš? Which wine do you want?
— CrnoA. Red. (lit. ‘black’)
Don’t forget that prepositions also go before the question word, but with these
questions, prepositions can be left out in answers:
Na kojem trguDL je koncertN? ‘Which city square is the concert on?’
— Na glavnomDL. On the main one.
— GlavnomDL. The main one.
Likewise, if the context is known, you can ask just:
KojuA želiš? Which one do you want?
The word to that can be added to most čiji, kakav (kakv-) and koji questions,
emphasizing they’re about something present, visible, close to speaker:
ČijuA toN knjiguA čitaš? Whose book are you reading? (I saw you reading it)
KakvuA toN knjiguA čitaš? What kind of book are you reading? (I saw you reading it)
From the adjectives čiji and kakav (kakv-) there are the following generic adjectives
(sometimes called ‘pronouns’):
svačiji everybody’s
nečiji someone’s
ničiji nobody’s
svakakav (svakakv-) of every kind, diverse
nekakav (nekakv-) of some kind
nikakav (nikakv-) of no kind, of poor quality
The adjectives derived from kakav (kakv-) cannot be easily translated into English.
For example:
Nečiji pasN je pred ulazomI. Someone’s dog is in front of the entrance.
Nekakav pasN je pred ulazomI. A dog of some sort is in front of the entrance.
Adjectives above starting with ni- require the verb to be negated as well, as usual:
Ne vidim nikakvog psaA. I don’t see any dog. (lit. ‘I don’t see no kind of dog.’)
Here nikakav (nikakv-) has meaning close to English no, but keep in mind it requires
negation of the verb.

58 Colloquial and Formal
If you look into a Croatian dictionary and look for a word for clothes iron (the thing
to iron your shirt), very likely, you’ll find the word glačalo. However, that word is
extremely rare in real use: a large majority uses another word, pegla (there’s yet
another word for that term, which will be explained below).
The word glačalo is considered ‘standard’ and ‘formal’ and will be used only in
formal circumstances, in written formal language; in casual writing, even in
newspapers, pegla dominates, it’s more than 20 times more common. We say that
the word pegla is colloquial.
There are some formal nouns that are almost never used in speech, for example:
 
Std. Croatian
colloq.
airplane
zrakoplov
avion
fridge
hladnjak
frižider
elevator
dizalo
lift
If you do a Google™ search on the .hr domain for the phrases u liftu and u dizalu
(both meaning in elevator, of course), you’ll get results like these:
u liftu
34600
u dizalu
3480
Such results, 10:1 in favor of the colloquial word – in writing! – are common: many
colloquial words prevail even in newspapers and fiction books, including
translations. However, you will see the rare standard word from time to time.
Sometimes, Standard Croatian uses a whole phrase, while in everyday use, there is a
simple word:
 
Std. Croatian
colloq.
whipped cream
tučeno slatko vrhnje
šlag
semolina
pšenična krupica
griz
The following adjectives are common but colloquial; however standard words are
often used as well:
 
Std. Croatian
colloq.
fresh
svjež
friški
violet
ljubičast
lila
pink
ružičast
roza
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 58 Colloquial and Formal

There are couple of verbs as well, again the standard words are heard as well:
 
Std. Croatian
colloq.
lack, miss
nedostajati (nedostaje) faliti
fry
pržiti
frigati
There are some nouns that are specific to Croatian, and feel more formal, but they
are used alongside other, international-sounding nouns, and there’s even a small
difference in meaning (that’s not always observed):
library
knjižnica
biblioteka
music
glazba
muzika
system
sustav
sistem
Then, there are some verbs that are usually used in a form that’s slightly different
than in a (Standard Croatian) dictionary. Two common verbs are:
 
Std.
colloq.
count
brojiti
brojati (broji)
paint
bojiti
bojati (boji)
On the internet, colloquial forms are 3-4 times more common than the standard
forms (which are basically limited to newspapers, books, and official writings), and
the colloquial forms completely prevail in speech. The meaning paint above doesn’t
include art, only when you paint a fence, wall, etc.
Many verbs with inf in -jeti also have a standard and a colloquial form. For example,
these are standard forms:
smrdjeti (smrdi, smrdio, smrdjela) stink
starjeti (stari, stario, starjela) grow old
svrbjeti (svrbi, svrbio, svrbjela) itch
štedjeti (štedi, štedio, štedjela) save (money, resources)
vrtjeti (vrti, vrtio, vrtjela) spin, turn
Instead of these forms, you’ll very frequently see – especially in casual writing and
conversation, but also in some newspapers – the following simplified forms, having
just -i-:
smrditi stink
stariti grow old
svrbiti itch
štediti save (money, resources) 
vrtiti spin, turn

Bear in mind that the Internet also includes edited text (laws, newspapers) where
colloquial forms are quite rare.
This applies also to derived verbs, simple ostariti is much more common than
standard forms. For more information about such verbs, check A3 Verbs.
I will list all those verbs with both forms in the infinitive, e.g.
vrtjeti / vrtiti spin, turn
There are nouns that are used in two forms in real life, one masculine, another
feminine – and the feminine form actually prevails – while Standard Croatian insists
on the masculine form only. The common ones are:
Standard
common (colloq.)
planet
planet
planeta
visit
posjet
posjeta
Then, Standard Croatian insists on three-way demonstrative adverbs of place and
destination:
Standard
loc.
dest.
close
ovdje
ovamo
mid
tu
tamo
distant
ondje
onamo
However, the adverb ondje is quite rare in real life – you can find it mostly in books
– most speakers use only two-way distinctions, while tamo serves two roles:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 58 Colloquial and Formal
337 / 600

colloq.
loc.
dest.
close
(here)
ovdje
tu
ovamo
not close
(there)
tamo
tamo
(onamo)
For example, on the newspaper site jutarnji.hr, the adverb tamo is 5 times more
frequent than ondje. On the discussion site forum.hr, it’s 27 times more frequent.
The adverb onamo is also less frequent than the others, so I’ve put it into brackets.
Sometimes, the Standard Croatian slowly accepts forms actually used. One example
is the verb koristiti use. It can be used in three ways, and two of them have the
same meaning:
koristiti + A (very common, but non-standard)
koristiti se² + I (less common, but standard)
Using this verb simply with A is being gradually accepted as standard.
Other colloquial words are regional, they are known only in one region, e.g. šlapa
house slipper, to the point that frequently people from other regions will not be able
to understand it.
The following colloquial nouns are commonly used in the coastal region (this is just a
short list, there are many more):
 
Std./inland
coast
bed sheet
plahta
lancun
fork
vilica
pirun
pillow
jastuk
kušin
towel
ručnik
šugaman
As you’ll see later, many such terms are related to home, especially food an cooking.
Often, there are triplets – one colloquial word dominates inland, another dominates
coastal areas, and there’s a standard word which is used only rarely:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 58 Colloquial and Formal
338 / 600

 
Standard
inland
coast
clothing iron
glačalo
pegla
šumpreš
screwdriver
odvijač
šrafciger
kacavida
shoelaces
vezice f pl.
žniranci m pl.
špigete f pl.
small meal,
lunch during work
užina
gablec
marenda
tomato
rajčica
paradajz
pom
pomidor
So, here’s is the third term used for the clothing iron in Croatia. Some coastal-
specific terms, such as šumpreš, are getting rare, at least in public, while inland (or
standard) terms dominate. (Try Googling™ for šumpreš). However, marenda or
pomidor are very common.
There are also triplets where all three terms are common in real life:
 
Standard
inland
coast
screw (noun)
vijak (vijk-) šaraf
vida
slice (of cake, bread) kriška
šnita
feta
You can find more about features of language colloquially used in most coastal
regions in 78 Dijete vs. Dite. (Note that colloquial use in Croatia includes also many
novels, poetry and popular songs.)
Yet other colloquial words are restricted to just one age group, usually teenagers
and young adults, e.g. frend friend (feminine version: frendica). It’s used at many
places, but not by many grandmothers.
English has many word pairs, where one word is an inherited Germanic word, and
another came from French or Latin (e.g. freedom/liberty, stay/remain, etc.).
Croatian has similar pairs, where one word is inherited from Slavic, while another is
Turkic or Greek:
 
Slavic
Turkic/Greek
bed
postelja
krevet
well
zdenac (zdenc-) bunar
kerchief
rubac (rupc-)
marama
Both words are used, and interestingly, often Turkic or Greek words prevail in
standard use, even in actual speech, while Slavic prevail in some (western and
coastal) regions, which were less influenced by Turks, and are found in poetry.
Besides colloquial words, there are colloquial ways of expressing various things. One
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 58 Colloquial and Formal
339 / 600

such thing is telling time in 12-hour manner, and in quarters and halves. It has two
variants, inland and coastal:
time
inland
coast
14:00
dva
dva
14:15
frtalj tri
dva i kvarat
14:30
pol(a) tri ®
dva i po(l)
14:45
tri frtalj tri
tri frtalja tri
tri manje kvarat
dva i trikvarat
15:00
tri
tri
Observe that inland, number of quarters is relative the last full hour, but expressions
use the next hour! This is a quite non-obvious way to express time. This is similar to
ways in Southern Germany and Austria (and frtalj (frtalj-) comes from German
‘viertel’, meaning quarter). The same non-obvious scheme is common in Hungarian.
This is only a very shallow outline of the real language diversity in Croatia. If we
would add neighboring countries (i.e. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia)
we would have more variation, especially in terms related to home and cooking,
names of various tools, etc. Terms in Serbia sometimes are more common with
colloquial terms in inland Croatia, due to the common German influence, so
paradajz is spoken in both Zagreb and Belgrade; however, there are also many
terms used in Serbia which are almost unknown in Croatia. A very brief overview of
such terms is given in A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin.
________
® Expressing 14:30 as pola tri is also very common in Serbia and Bosnia, but tri
frtalja tri = 14:45 is unknown in these countries.

59 Knowing and Telling: Content and Noun Clauses
Let’s learn how to talk about anything else in Croatian. For instance, something has
happened, for instance Ana has bought a car. Now, you know it, and you want to tell
that fact. In English, you would say:
I know (that) Ana has bought a car.
In English, you simply add that + what you know, and the word that is usually left
out. In Croatian, you must use the word da:
Znam da je AnaN kupila autoA.
The word da holds the first position in the clause, as usual, so all second-position
words (here just je²) come right after it:
Znam [da je² AnaN kupila autoA].
Such clauses that can hold any information, but follow the same rules as normal
sentences, are called content clauses. The most common verbs used with such
clauses are (by descending order of certainty):
znati know
vjerovati (vjeruje) believe
misliti think
pretpostavljati suppose
Out of these verbs, znati and misliti are most used in spoken language. The verb
misliti normally means think, but with content clauses it maybe better translates as
English guess, suppose, because it’s very uncommon to use it negated. Where you
would say this in English:
I don’t think [they have fish].
In Croatian, the sentence would be phrased as:
Mislim [da nemaju ribuA]. lit. ‘I think [they don’t have fish].’
Interestingly, the verb vjerovati (vjeruje) believe is mostly used in negative with
content clauses:
Ne vjerujem [da imaju ribuA]. I don’t believe [they have fish].
Note. The main verb is here negated, but the verb in the content clause isn’t: the
all-negative-or-nothing principle works for each clause separately. Each clause –
the main one and the inserted one – has its own word counting, and its own verb,
which can be negative (which causes certain pronouns and adverbs to be
negative) or not!
Such clauses can be used by verbs of information transfer (really, verb pairs). All of
them allow for an optional recipient of information expressed in DL and a content
clause (or an object in A):

kazati
reći past-f
(

)
čitati ~ pro- read
dokazivati (-uje «) ~ dokazati (dokaže) prove
javljati ~ javiti inform, let know
govoriti («) ~ reći (reče, rekao, rekla) tell, say
objašnjavati («) ~ objasniti («) explain
pisati (piše) ~ na- («) write
pokazivati (-uje «) ~ pokazati (pokaže) show
priznavati (priznaje) ~ priznati admit
For example:
Objasnila je AniDL da uči hrvatskiA. She explained to Ana that she has been learning
Croatian.
The present tense forms of reći (...) are rare: the verb kazati (kaže) is usually used
instead®. This verb is also sometimes used in the true present tense, as an
imperfective verb:
Kažem tiDL da nisam gladnaN. I’m telling you I’m not hungry.
Another option, common in colloquial speech in the Zagreb region, but also known
elsewhere, is to use the verb (veli) which has present tense forms only:
Velim tiDL da nisam gladnaN. (colloq.) I’m telling you I’m not hungry.
This verb considered a bit archaic in other regions.
You can talk about what someone said (reported speech). For instance, someone
said:
„Učim hrvatskiA.” “I’m learning Croatian.”
To report about it, you should (as in English) change it to the 3rd person, since you’re
talking about someone else (here I assume that that person is female, but the
Croatian sentence is here completely unspecific, since it’s in the present tense):
Kaže da uči hrvatskiA. She says she’s learning Croatian.
Znam da će padati kišaN. I know it’s going to rain.
However, if you report about the past, in English the reported clause gets time-
shifted, e.g.:
She said she was learning Croatian.
I knew it was going to rain.
There’s no time-shift in Croatian. We simply report things in the original tense (that’s
one more thing where Croatian is simpler than English):
Rekla je da uči hrvatskiA.
Znala sam da će padati kišaN.
Therefore, we literally say ‘I knew it will rain’.

Croatian content clauses are simply normal sentences inserted, with a da put to
the front. There’s no rearrangement (except for the second position words
coming after da). There’s no replacement of biti with (bude). Perfective verbs
cannot be used in the present tense unless the verbs can be used in normal
sentences, etc. This behavior is completely different from superficially similar
desire or purpose clauses, which also start with da.
Next, you can use any information in your sentence. For example, where the car is:
Gdje je autoN? Where is the car?
Znam [gdje je autoN]. I know where the car is.
Pay attention how English is holds different positions in the question and the I-know
sentence. This doesn’t happen in Croatian, there’s no rearrangement whatsoever.
(You cannot use any other arrangement, as the question-word, here gdje, must start
both a question and a derived clause).
Questions are simply re-used as clauses, now da must not be used, since you already
have a "connecting" word to start the clause. The following examples are a ‘what’
and an ‘opinion’ clause:
ŠtoA si rekao? What did you say?
Čula sam [štoA si rekao]. I heard [what you said].
ŠtoA da radim? What should I do?
Ne znam [štoA da radim]. I don’t know [what I should do]. (or what to do)
I sometimes make mistakes in English, keeping the question word order – my native
language has no rearrangement. You can use questions for reasons, time, etc.:
Ne znam [zašto je otišla]. I don’t know why she left.
Next, you can express that you don’t know if something is true or not (or you’re
trying to find out, or you’re interested in, etc.). In Croatian, you simply use yes/no
questions as clauses:
Je li kupila autoA? Did she buy a car?
Ne znam [je li kupila autoA]. I don’t know if she bought a car.
Again, the English sentence must be rearranged – from a question to a report – but
Croatian is not rearranged. You simply use questions as clauses!
However, you cannot use shortened forms of questions. In the following examples,
shortened questions (S) cannot be used as clauses, only the full forms (F):
(F) Da li da kupim autoA? Should I buy a car?
(S) Da kupim autoA? (the same, but shortened)
Ne znam [da li da kupim autoA]. I don’t know if I should buy a car.
This applies to colloquial forms as well:

(S) Idemo u kinoA? (the same, but shortened)
Zanima meA [jel idemo u kinoA]. (colloq.) I wonder if we’re going to cinema.
Besides znati know, and two verbs vidjeti (...) see and čuti (čuje) hear, introduced
long ago, there are following common verbs of knowledge and perception:
osjećati ~¹ osjetiti (+ A/CC) feel
primjeć ivati (-uje «) ~¹ primijetiti («) (+ A/CC) notice
razumjeti (razumije,...) (+ A/CC) understand
shvaćati ® ~~ shvatiti (+ A/CC) understand
You have likely noticed some special notation in the verb pair list (~¹, ~~). Actually,
the perf. verbs in such pairs are not ordinary perf. verbs. They rather indicate start
of state or a single instance. Therefore, osjetiti means feel for a moment, while
shvatiti indicates the moment you understood something – it’s implied you
understand it from then on (like e.g. come to understand). Such verbs are explained
in detail in 81 Sneeze Once and Start Blooming.
As with znati know, these verbs are used either with objects in A or content clauses:
Primijetila je da nema AneG. She noticed that Ana wasn’t there. (lit. ‘that there was
no Ana’)
Osjećam da će padati kišaN. I feel it’s going to rain.
Razumijem da nemaš puno vremenaG. I understand you don’t have
much time.
Very similar are the following verbs and verb pairs:
nadati se² (+ DL/CC) hope
sanjati (+ A/CC) dream
zamišljati («) ~ zamisliti (+ A/CC) imagine
For example:
Sanjao sam da sam na odmoruDL. I dreamed I was on vacation.
Nadam se da je AnaN došla. I hope Ana has arrived.
(Observe again the tense shift in English vs. no shift in Croatian.)
You will sometimes see (mostly in writing) using kako instead of da when content
clauses are objects of the verbs above. Recall this line from the example in the
chapter 52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease:
OnN sanja [kako beskrajno pada] lit. ‘He’s dreaming [he’s falling endlessly]’
You can talk about content clauses, making them really subjects. Since they are not
nouns, they behave as if neuter singular, as you can see from the past tense:
Dobro je [da ne pada kišaN]. It’s good [it’s not raining].
Bilo je dobro [da nije padala kišaN]. It was good [it wasn’t raining].

The second clause is in the past tense: we’re not reporting what somebody else said,
but what was. There are a lot of similar ways to comment content, e.g. with the
following words instead of dobro:
bolje better
čudno strange, weird
glupo stupid
jasno clear
loše bad
očito obvious
strašno terrible
šteta too bad
You can use many other adjectives to comment on content, including colloquial
super great and more. You can add also who thinks/feels that in DL:
AniDL je jasno da... It’s clear to Ana that...
AniDL je bilo jasno da... It was clear to Ana that...
There’s one special rule – if you just comment (without who feels/thinks in DL) in the
present tense, you can leave je² out (I’m not completely sure if that’s accepted in
standard or not, but it’s quite widespread):
Dobro da ne pada kišaN. It’s good it’s not raining.
There are two very common and similar expressions, with stronger meaning than
dobro da...:
srećom da...
sva sreća da... 
   fortunately
The expression sva sreća da... is especially common to express that something
might have been much worse (e.g. a building collapsed, but, fortunately, nobody was
in it at that moment):
Sva sreća da ne pada kišaN. Fortunately, it’s not raining.
You can express feelings with dative phrases involving drago and žao:
AniDL je žao da... Ana was sorry that...
AniDL je bilo drago da... Ana was glad/happy that...
You can like content (here content clauses are again subjects):
Sviđa miDL se da je AnaN došla. I like that Ana came.
You can also refer to the content expressed before using the general pronoun to.
That’s often used in conversation, but also common in writing:
AnaN je kupila autoA. Ana bought a car.
— Nisam toA znao. I didn’t know that.
You can use to and a content clause anywhere, even after prepositions (you have to
change to into the right case):
Razgovarali smo o tomeDL da je AnaN kupila autoA. We discussed about Ana
buying a car. (lit. ‘about that Ana has bought a car’)

If you comment on a known fact, you can use što instead of da – it doesn’t change
when in this role:
Dobro je što ne pada kišaN. It’s good it’s not raining. ®
This construction is also used to thank somebody for something, but it’s mandatory
to use što then:
Hvala što ne pušite. Thank you for not smoking. (lit. ‘Thank you that you don’t
smoke.’)
Hvala tiDL što miDL pomažeš. Thank you for helping me. (lit. ‘Thank you that
you’re helping me.’)
The DL in the main clause (e.g. ti² in the second example) is optional. English uses a
completely different construction here, while Croatian simply uses a content clause;
however, da cannot be used, only što.
You can also ask about things within content clauses, using the same way as in
English:
ŠtoA misliš [da sam kupila]? What do you think [I’ve bought]?
GdjeA misliš [da je AnaN]? Where do you think [Ana is]?
Such questions are mostly ‘decomposed’ in speech, into two questions (the first
starting always with što what):
ŠtoA misliš, štoA sam kupila? lit. ‘What do you think, what have I bought?’ ®
ŠtoA misliš, gdje je AnaN? lit. ‘What do you think, where is Ana?’
Something interesting (but expected from everything above) happens when we ask
yes/no questions and they contain context clauses. Such questions are
‘decomposed’ less often, ans the interesting part are the answers – they are simply
re-used as content clauses:
Misliš li da je moreN toploN? Do you think the sea is warm?
Misliš da je moreN toploN? (the same, but colloq.; you can use other forms too)
— Mislim da je. I think it is.
— Mislim da da. lit. ‘I think that yes.’
— Mislim da nije. I think it isn’t.
— Mislim da ne. lit. ‘I think that no.’
As you can answer a yes/no question with a verb or with a da or ne, you can answer
such questions with mislim da + verb or mislim da da or mislim da ne. Again, the
verb misliti is not negated, but the content clause can be: such answers are similar
to English I guess so and I guess not.
Of course, you can remember some event, forget to do something, then you can
expect or fear that something might happen, etc.; I will explain all such uses in 69
Memories, Expectations and Fear.

® You’ll encounter rečem and so on from time to time, especially in Dalmatia, where
it’s often used in everyday speech.
Instead of kino, the word used for cinema in Serbia and most of Bosnia is bioskop.
Instead of shvaćati, a slightly different verb shvatati, is common in most parts of
Bosnia and in Serbia.
Although što is colloquially replaced by šta, and such replacement is complete in
Bosnia and Serbia, in both the standard languages and the actual speech, it’s almost
never replaced when što starts a content clause. However, it is often replaced in
colloquial speech in Dalmatia. Of course, when što starts a real question (što
misliš...?) it’s normally replaced by šta.
• Examples
The song Sve je u redu Everything is OK by Flyer, a pop-group from Zagreb, contains
a number of desire and content clauses.
The first verse uses the verb skrivati hide and, as usual, it’s just lice face – the
possession is implied:
Ne skrivam osmijehA s licaG
I’m not hiding the smile from my face
Želim [da znaš
I want [you to know
[Da sveN je u reduDL
[Everything is OK
ovaj danA]]
on this day]]
(Mirko Kovač)
The second verse has a desire clause that contains a content clause (in the third
verse). The word je² is the third word in the clause, likely due to rhythmic reasons
(but also you can treat sve je u redu as a kind of phrase).
The following lines have a content clause in a content clause, but the inner clause
starts with kako (it could have started with da without any difference):
Mislim [da ne misliš
I think [you don’t think
[kako svemuDL je krajN]]
[everything is over]]
Al sveN je u reduDL
But everything is OK
ovaj danA
on this day
The line svemu je kraj is the construction:
biti (je² +) kraj + DL
It means something (expressed in DL) is over. The noun kraj is the (formal) subject.
The word al is just ali but, colloquially shortened, which is common.

60 More Useful Verbs and Verbal Patterns
Now, let me introduce a couple of very useful verb pairs. The first one is the main
way to express success and failure in Croatian:
uspijevati («) ~ uspjeti (uspije, uspio, uspjela) succeed ®
The impf. verb has the Standard stress shift to the 1st syllable (-ije- is usually one
syllable when inside a word), but the perf. verb is pronounced as three syllables in
the present tense: us-pi-je, like piti (pije) drink.
Unlike English, this verb takes a verb in inf – or an infinitive clause, i.e. an inf with an
object and possibly other words attached – as its object. It can be translated with
English succeed or manage:
Uspjeli smo riješiti problemA. We succeeded in solving the problem. ®
Uspjela je otvoriti prozorA. She managed to open the window.
Nisam uspio pročitati knjiguA. I failed to read the book.
This verb is not used to ‘manage household’ and similar things – only to manage to
do something.
Like trebati need/should, this verb pair can be – and often is – used in the ‘reverse’
mode: what is achieved (or not) is the subject (in N), and the person (or animal) who
was responsible is optionally expressed in DL. As usual, if the subject is a verb in inf,
it behaves like neuter singular:
Uspjelo namDL je riješiti problemA. We succeeded in solving the problem.
Uspjelo jojDL je otvoriti prozorA. She managed to open the window.
Nije miDL uspjelo pročitati knjiguA. I failed to read the book.
Note that problem, prozor and knjiga are not the subjects: the subjects are now the
verbs in inf: riješiti and so on.
In this mode, the verb pair is more versatile: the subject can be also a noun:
something that you succeeded in making (or failed to make). Now you must observe
the gender of subject in the past tense:
KolačN je uspio. The cake turned out fine.
Uspio namDL je kolačN. We succeeded in making the cake.
I have already explained important verbs derived from ići (ide, išao, išla) go and
stajati (staje) ~ stati (stane) stand, now I will show you two more important
‘families’. The first one is derived from the verb pair:
stavljati ~ staviti put, place
These verbs are simple to use – just use A for what you put, and a destination (unlike
in English!) for where you put something:
Stavio sam pivoA u frižiderA. (colloq.) I’ve put the beer in the fridge.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 60 More Useful Verbs and Verbal Pa~erns
350 / 600

3m/n
(I marked this as colloquial, but the Standard Croatian noun hladnjak is very rare in
real life.) Of course, you can also specify the location of the destination, i.e. where
the fridge is (e.g. u frižider u kuhinji).
The verbs are derived from this pair in the same way as with the stand pair: the
same prefix is attached to both verbs and we get a new pair with a different
meaning than the original one. Two pairs we have already encountered:
ostavljati ~ ostaviti leave (a thing)
pretpostavljati ~ pretpostaviti suppose, assume
The verb pair ostavljati ~ ostaviti is frequently used with a metaphoric location na
miru in peace, in meaning leave alone, that is, not interfere:
Ostavio sam gaA na miruDL. I left him alone.
Another frequently used verb pair is:
nastavljati ~ nastaviti keep on, continue
This pair is usually used with another verb in inf (it can be also used with an object in
A, usually some activity). This is another phase verb – the verb after it should be
impf., since we describe action, and not outcomes:
Nastavio sam čitati. I continued reading. ®
This can be also translated as kept on reading – this verb pair is the way to express
that meaning in Croatian. Also, you likely noticed that the prefix na means on.
This verb pair translates to several meanings in English:
postavljati ~ postaviti set
The basic meaning is set, in the meaning fix, put on an elevated place, erect (a
monument), but also make ready (e.g. set the table). It’s not used in the meanings
set free, set in motion (Croatian has specific verbs for such actions):
AnaN je postavila stolA. Ana has set the table. ®
When you want to express where something is placed or fixed, you have to use
destinations, like for the base pair, but again unlike in English:
Postavit ću slikuA na zidA. I’ll put the picture on the wall.
Interestingly, this verb is also the most common verb used to formulate and ask
questions:
Postavio sam dva pitanja24. I asked two questions. (I = male)
These two verb pairs have exactly the opposite meaning:
rastavljati ~ rastaviti take apart, disassemble
sastavljati ~ sastaviti put together, assemble
When you disassemble something, the result is expressed in na¨ + A (usually in
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 60 More Useful Verbs and Verbal Pa~erns
351 / 600

plural):
GoranN je rastavio igračkuA na dijeloveA. Goran has disassembled the toy to its
parts.
The following table summarizes this verb pair and its (common) family:

There are more verb pairs derived from this base pair; these were just the most
common ones.
Another very common verb family is derived from:
davati (daje) ~ dati give
The verb pair is simply used with two objects, one in A (what is given) another in DL
(who got it):
AnaN je dala GoranuDL čokoladuA. Ana has given Goran a chocolate.
This pair is used first in literal meaning of ‘give’, not when e.g. ‘giving a lecture’.
However, it has more uses than this basic one (it could be argued that dati behaves
as a ‘modal’ verb in some circumstances). They will be explained gradually.
It’s interesting that the perf. verb dati is often used in the present tense, especially
when negated, to indicate intentions:
Ne dam tiDL loptuA. I don’t want to give you the ball.
The perf. verb is short (its pres-3 is only one syllable) so it’s one of few verbs where
stress shifts to the negative particle ne¨ even in the ‘western’ stress scheme. This is
the cause of quite frequent (but non-standard) spellings like nedamo we don’t want
to give and like.
This verb pair is also used in an interesting phrase:
davati (daje) ~ dati + sve od sebe do his/her/their best
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 60 More Useful Verbs and Verbal Pa~erns

m
prodavati
predavati
For example:
Dali smo sve od sebe. We did our best.
All verbs derived from this pair follow the same pattern, e.g.:
dodavati (dodaje / dodaje) ~ dodati
I’ll show you three common derived verb pairs. Each of them behaves like the base
pair: there are two objects, one in A, another, optional, in DL.
With the prefix do-, the meaning is add, but also pass (e.g. salt or ball in a game):
IvanN je dodao loptuA MarkuDL. Ivan passed the ball to Marko.
This verb can be used for mathematical addition, but there’s another verb pair with
the specifically mathematical meaning:
zbrajati ~ zbrojiti add (in math)
With the prefix pro-, the meaning is sell:
DarkoN je prodao autoA AniDL. Darko sold the car to Ana.
IvanN prodaje jabukeA. Ivan sells apples.
The third common verb pair is derived with pre-, with the meaning hand over:
PoštarN je predao pismoA AniDL. The postman handed the letter over to Ana.
The impf. verb from this pair is also used in meaning give lectures (for more
information, check 73 Learning and Renting: Verbs Shifting):
IvanN predaje matematikuA. Ivan teaches math.
All three pairs have also alternative forms of present tense of the impf. verb, which
are regularized, i.e. dodavam, etc. They are much less common that the standard
forms.

There are more common verbs derived from this pair. One of them is derived with
u-. It behaves differently than the pairs above, and has a bit unexpected meaning:
marry. Moreover, its use is rather specific; for more details, check 89 Customs and
Traditions.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 60 More Useful Verbs and Verbal Pa~erns
353 / 600

All the pairs we have seen are simply derived from the base pair, by prefixes. This
pattern of derivation can be called symmetric.
The pair opposite to davati (daje) ~ dati give is:
dobivati («) ~ dobiti (dobije) get
This verb pair is used with an object in A (more or less mandatory):
AnaN je dobila porukuA. Ana has got a message.
The origin can be expressed by adding od¨ + G:
AnaN je dobila porukuA od IvanaG. Ana has got a message from Ivan.
There is also an alternative, non-standard present form of the impf verb: dobija.
If you know only English, you should pay attention that this pair is used in a very
restricted manner compared to English get: only when you physically get
something, but also when you get an e-mail, disease, idea or chance.
It’s not used to express it’s getting dark, somebody got (understood) something,
they got busy, or a plane got delayed...
Instead of the English multi-purpose get, other verbs (i.e. verb pairs) must be used in
Croatian in the following common situations:
English get
Croatian verb(s)
I got beer from the fridge
donositi («) ~ donijeti (donese,...) bring
I got what you said
razumjeti (razumije,...) understand
I got home, got to work
dolaziti ~ doći (dođe, došao, došla) come
I’ve got the tickets
imati have
I’ve got to go, gotta go
morati must
I got hungry
postajati (postaje) ~ postati (postane) become
I’ve got my hair cut
I got my car repaired
rephrase, use specific verbs
However, if you say that you literally got the tickets (i.e. you wasn’t sure there were
any tickets left, but you got them) you should use dobivati («) ~ dobiti (dobije) get.
This is an example where English is quite imprecise.
Some of the specific verbs in the table above have been already explained;
expressing bring will be explained in the following chapters. The last line (got my car
repaired) is called causative. It can be also expressed with the verb have:
I have my car repaired.
It’s impossible to express exactly this in Croatian. Usually, it’s expressed either
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 60 More Useful Verbs and Verbal Pa~erns

impersonally (popravili su moj/mi auto they repaired my car) or using passive
constructions (matching English my car was repaired). A Croatian passive
construction will be introduced right in the next chapter.
________
® “Ekavian” forms, which dominate in Serbia, apply to the perf. verb uspjeti, in the
same way as for razumjeti (razumije,...) understand: its “Ekavian” form is uspeti,
the verb is fully regular, but the pres-3pl is uspeju.
In Serbia, infinitives are less often used in speech (and they get rarer more you go
southeast), the form da + present prevails. In Serbia, it would be much more
common to say:
Uspeli smo da rešimo problemA. We succeeded in solving the problem.
Uspela je da otvori prozorA. She managed to open the window.

The noun stol table has the form sto (stol-) in Serbia and most of Bosnia, but it’s still
masculine.

61 Cake is Eaten: Passive Adjectives
English is well-known for reusing various verb forms. For instance, the same word
(eaten) has two quite different meanings in the following sentences:
Ana has eaten. (what she did)
The cake is eaten. (state of the cake)
Croatian has a different approach – each meaning has a different word. Words
corresponding to the second meaning – adjectives for what happened to something
or someone are called passive adjectives.
Passive adjectives are verb forms, but not all verbs have a meaningful pass.
adjective. Verbs that cannot have an object (e.g. sleep – you cannot sleep
something) won’t have an adjective that’s really used.
There are some verbs (and verb pairs) that can have an object, but their pass.
adjective is never used. Some of them are:
čuti (čuje) hear
htjeti (hoće +,...) want
imati have
osjećati ~ osjetiti feel
razumjeti (razumije,...) understand
It’s difficult to explain why the pass. adj. of razumjeti (...) isn’t used, while the pass.
adj. of shvatiti perf., a verb with a very similar meaning, is used. Likewise, željeti
(želi, želio, željela) wish, desire has a used pass. adj., but htjeti (...) doesn’t!
Likewise, there’s no pass. adj. from verbs that don’t use objects in A, such as
uspijevati («) ~ uspjeti (uspije,...) succeed and similar ones.
Passive adjectives can be made for both impf. and perf. verbs. However, since perf.
verbs indicate that the action is complete, pass. adjectives made from them are used
more often. In fact, pass. adjectives of most impf. verbs are not used at all, or are
extremely rare. The following impf. verbs have pass. adjectives that are frequently
used in speech:
čistiti clean
čitati read
čuvati keep
gledati watch
graditi build
koristiti use
kuhati cook
očekivati (očekuje) expect
peći (peče,…) bake
pratiti follow
pržiti fry
nositi carry/wear
voljeti (voli,…) love
željeti (želi,…) wish, desire
It’s worth knowing that Croatian has one more way of expressing passive,
introduced in 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se², with less restrictions.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 61 Cake is Eaten: Passive Adjec!ves
356 / 600

All passive adjectives in Croatian end in either -n (a vast majority) or -t. Always keep
in mind that they are real adjectives, that is, they must adapt to gender, case and
number.
For regular verbs that have infinitive ending in -ati, it’s really simple to make a pass.
adjective, just replace -ati with -an:
verb
pass. adj.
gledati watch
gledan watched
napisati (napiše) perf. write
napisan written
poslati (pošalje) perf. send
poslan sent
As you can see, even verbs that have a bit irregular pres-3 follow this simple pattern
if their inf ends in -ati.
Since these words are adjectives, they adapt to nouns as any other adjectives do.
For example:
PismoN je napisanoN i poslanoN. The letter is written and sent.
For verbs that don’t have infinitives in -ati, the rules are more complicated.
For most verbs that have pres-3 ending in -e, their pass. adjective is simply made by
adding -n to the pres-3 (I have omitted all past forms for clarity):
verb
pass. adj.
naći (nađe) perf. find
nađen found
peći (peče) bake
pečen baked
pojesti (pojede) perf. eat
pojeden eaten
plesti (plete) knit
pleten knitted
Finally we can say:
KolačN je pojedenN. The cake is eaten.
Since this adjective is derived from a perfective verb, it’s implied that the cake is no
more.
For verbs that have pres-3 ending in -i – and there are many such verbs – the -i is
removed and -en is added. Unless they are Croatian-specific or an r, consonants
before -en get changed, e.g. t is changed to ć (I have again omitted all past forms for
clarity):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 61 Cake is Eaten: Passive Adjec!ves
357 / 600

stajati
m
m
verb
pass. adj.
naučiti («) perf. learn
naučen learned
pržiti fry
pržen fried
otvoriti («) perf. open
otvoren open
zatvoriti («) perf. close
zatvoren closed
platiti perf. pay
plaćen paid
shvatiti perf. understand
shvaćen understood
vratiti perf. return
vraćen returned
For example:
ŠkolaN je zatvorenaN. The school is closed.
Stojim pred otvorenim vratimaI. I’m standing in front of the open door.
KnjigaN je vraćenaN. The book is returned.
RačunN nije bio plaćenN. The bill was not paid.
Other consonants and consonant groups undergo more complicated changes. Bear
in mind, the infinitive is not important here, but the pres-3:
verb
pass. adj.
baciti perf. throw
bačen thrown
spasiti perf. rescue ®
spašen rescued
zaraziti perf. infect
zaražen infected
vidjeti (vidi) see
viđen seen
voljeti (voli) love
voljen loved ®
napuniti perf. fill up
napunjen filled up ®
kupiti perf. buy
kupljen bought ®
napraviti perf. make
napravljen made ®
primiti perf. receive
primljen received ®
For example:
AutoN je napravljenN u PoljskojDL, a kupljenN ovdje. The car is made in Poland
and bought here.
Poruka je već primljena. The message is already received.
Moj autoN je popravljenN. My car has been repaired.
The last sentence can be used to translate I got my car repaired from the previous
chapter (the verb is popraviti perf. repair; it will be introduced in 79 You’re Wrong
and Other Phrases).
Other verbs that have pres-3 ending in -i follow the patterns of the verbs above; if
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 61 Cake is Eaten: Passive Adjec!ves
358 / 600

there are two consonants before the -i, they both undergo the change (however, if
the final consonants are st, some verbs get only št, while others get šć):
izmisliti perf. make up → izmišljen made up ®
čistiti clean → čišćen cleaned
koristiti use → korišten used ®
pustiti perf. let go → pušten released, freed
A few verbs with pres-3 ending in -i don’t have the expected shift; the most common
is:
zaposliti («) perf. employ → zaposlen employed
A few verbs have pass. adjectives that don't follow the above rules, e.g.:
skriti (skrije) perf. hide → skriven hidden
Since pass. adjectives are often used, you can remember them as separate words,
not verb forms.
It’s interesting that most pass. adjectives of perf. verbs have the Standard stress on
the first syllable (even if neither present nor infinitive has the stress on the first
syllable), and the ‘western’ stress on the same syllable where the inf is stressed:
inf
pres-3
pass. adj.
pročitati
pročita perf. read
pročitan read
However, verbs in -sti and -ći that have a rightward stress shift in the present tense
have pass. adjectives stressed like the present tense forms:
ispeći (ispeče,...) perf. bake → ispečen
This also applies to some verbs in -sti that have a shift only in the ‘western’ scheme:
pojesti (pojede) perf. eat → pojeden
Finally, there are verbs with infinitives in -nuti; they are again simple to transform
into pass. adjectives – for almost all of them, just discard the final -i and you have a
pass. adjective. Unlike others, it ends in -t and not in -n:
verb
pass. adj.
gurnuti (gurne) perf. push
gurnut pushed
pokrenuti (pokrene) perf. start, move
pokrenut started
The same holds for verbs similar to uzeti:
verb
pass. adj.
zauzeti (zauzme) perf. occupy
zauzet occupied
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 61 Cake is Eaten: Passive Adjec!ves
359 / 600

Infinitives of these verbs are similar to passive adjectives – actually, N-pl masc.
forms of pass. adjectives are identical to infinitives. However, stress distinguishes
some verbs from passive adjectives (in the Standard scheme):
pokrenuti verb (inf.)
pokrenuti pass. adj. (N-pl masc.)
zauzeti verb (inf.)
zauzeti pass. adj. (N-pl masc.)
________
® In Serbia, beside the verb spasiti perf. save, rescue, a similar verb is common:
spasti (spase, spasao, spasla), with the same meaning. Its passive adjective is
spasen, as expected. There are frequent discussions in Serbia which one of these
two verbs is ‘right’ (or ‘better’). A number of Serbian ‘linguists’ have been opposed to
spasiti for decades, but it appears to be more common in Serbia than spasti (...)!
However, you will occasionally encounter spasti (...) in Croatia as well.
“Ekavian” forms, which completely dominate in Serbia, have e instead of je or ije in
almost all places, but this replacement doesn’t apply to suffixes forming passive
adjectives! While the “Ekavian” form of voljeti love is voleti, the “Ekavian” pass.
adjective is voljen. The same applies to all other pass. adjectives formed with -jen.
In Serbia, few pass. adjectives have the regular šć where they don’t in Croatia: one
of them is korišćen. However, forms with šć are also used colloquially in parts of
Croatia, including pass. adjectives that have št in Standard Serbian, so you’ll
occasionally hear pušćen and others.

62 The Friend I Saw: Relative Clauses
It’s nice to be able to say the red apple or my friend, but it’s much more powerful to
be also able to say the apple you bought or the friend who called me.
In English, such sentences have basically two forms:
(1) the friend who called me
(2) the apple (that) you bought
In the sentence #1, you are describing the friend by what he did: he’s the subject of
called me. In the sentence #2, you are describing the apple by what happened to it:
somebody bought it.
In the first sentence, English must use the ‘linking’ word who; in the second one, the
word that is optional and is mostly dropped out.
In Croatian, there always must be a ‘linking’ word. It’s the same word – koji – in both
sentences, but in different cases (and gender).
Simply said, the word koji stands in for the noun you describe, and adapts to its
gender and number but also to its role in the description.
In the sentence #1, prijatelj friend is the subject, therefore we use koji in the
masculine singular, nominative case:
(1) prijatelj kojiN meA je zvao
In the sentence #2, jabuka apple is the object of the verb kupiti perf. buy – it’s
bought – therefore we must use accusative, but also the feminine form, since
jabuka is of course feminine in Croatian:
(2) jabuka kojuA si kupio
Take a note that jabuka is here in N – and free to change, as we’ll see – while the
word after it is in A, describing the role of jabuka in relation to the verb that
follows.
The section koji me je zvao or koju si kupio is another type of clause – the relative
clause. As in all other clauses, word-counting restarts in them, and the first position
is filled by the first word (a form of adjective/pronoun koji):
Pojeo sam jabukuA [kojuA¹ si² kupio]. I have eaten the apple [you bought].
The forms of koji were explained in 57 Whose, What Thing and What Like.
When you describe a noun like that, you can use it in any sentence, but the
description must come right after it. For example, that friend who called you could
also come to beach, so you would say:
PrijateljN kojiN meA je zvao je došao na plažuA. The friend who
called me came to the beach.

361 / 600

doći past-m | 1
1
1
1
doći past-mpl
moći pres-1
This sounds a bit awkward, but Croatian is flexible and usually nouns with such
descriptions attached are moved to the back:
Došao je na plažuA prijateljN kojiN meA je zvao. (the same meaning)
Bear in mind that the description does not change if the described noun change its
case:
Vidim prijateljaA kojiN meA je zvao. I can see the friend who called me.
Razgovarao sam s prijateljemI kojiN meA je zvao. I talked to the friend who
called me.
But if you change the noun to plural, you must also change the description, since you
are now really talking about something else:
Vidim prijateljeA kojiN su meA zvali. I can see the friends who called me.
Vidim prijateljeA kojeA sam čekao. I can see the friends I was waiting for.
In the first sentence, the adjective/pronoun koji is in N-pl, as the friends are the
subject of the clause; in the second one, it’s in A-pl, since they are the object in the
clause, while the subject is the first person (expressed by the 1st person verb sam).
It’s also obvious that forms of descriptive (i.e. relative) clauses are the same as
questions starting with koji. Therefore, if the role in description involves a
preposition, you must place it before koji:
Vidim prijateljaA s kojimI sam putovao. I can see the friend I traveled with.
Došli smo na plažuA na kojojDL je bilo mnogo ljudiG. ‘We came to a
beach many people were on.’
English is full of reduced passive clauses; for example, instead of:
We live in a house that was built by my grandfather.
The normal sentence is:
We live in a house built by my grandfather.
Such reducing is impossible in Croatian. Such passive clauses must be actually
rephrased in Croatian into non-passive:
Živimo u kućiDL kojuA je izgradio moj djedN. We live in a house my grandfather built.
You can also use relative clauses after indefinite pronouns (somebody,
everything...). However, there’s a twist in Croatian. If you use relative clauses after
indefinite pronouns, you have to use pronouns tko who or što what as conjunctions
instead of koji which/what! For example:
Vidio sam neštoA [štoA ne mogu objasniti]. I saw something [I can’t
explain].
The pronoun što what here changes case according to the role in the clause, and
prepositions came before it:

362 / 600

poznavati
2
doći past-mpl
Obući ću neštoA [u čemuDL se osjećam udobno]. I’ll put on something [I feel
comfortable in].
Here, we have the u¨ + DL combination, and DL of što is čem(u). If we use an
indefinite pronoun that refers to a person, we have to use forms of tko who:
Ovdje je netkoN [kogaA poznaješ]. Here’s somebody [you know].
Here, the form koga is the accusative form of tko who (refer to 28 Asking Who and
What), but its form coincides with shorter forms of koji; not so in nominative:
Ovdje je netkoN [tkoN će tiDL pomoći]. Here’s somebody [who will help you].
When you append a relative clause to the adjective/pronoun sav (spec. forms)
all/everything/everyone, normal relative clauses are used with plural forms, but with
neuter singular forms (meaning all, everything), što is used:
Došli su sviN [kojeA smo pozvali]. Everyone [we invited] came.
OvoN je sveN [štoA imam]. This is all [I have]. ®
The same applies to the past form ostali (check 52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease),
when used as an adjective which is used as a pronoun, and to other adjectives-used-
as-pronouns, such as:
prvi the first person
prvo the first thing
zadnji the last person
zadnje the last thing
(Don’t forget these are just forms of adjectives in various genders, so they change
like an adjective!) For example:
OvoN je zadnjeN [štoA ću kupiti]. This is the last thing [I’m going to buy]. ®
This table summarizes which form of relative clause is used in various situations:

svašta all kinds of things
sve everything, all
adjectives in neut. used as pronouns
 such as ostalo the rest (of stuff)
to that, ovo this, ono
što ...
If you know German, you have likely noticed that it has more or less the same
system – the pronoun der which is mandatory and changes gender and case
according to the role in the clause. However, with adjectives/pronouns such as alles,
the pronoun was (which matches Croatian što exactly) must be used instead:
(German)  Das ist alles, was ich weiß.
 
To je sve što znam. That’s all I know.
Other types of questions can be also used as relative clauses, relating to place and
time. For example:
OvoN je mjestoN [gdje smo se upoznali]. This is the place [where we met for the
first time].
Occasionally, you’ll see a quite different construction of relative clauses: što used
after nouns as well, but always in that form, not changing cases. This is rare in
speech, at least mine, but it seems more common in poetry.
Since the pronoun što in such construction doesn’t show the role in the relative
clause, there’s often another personal pronoun in the clause that refers to the noun
as well, so you might see:
OvoN su knjigeN [što sam ihA kupio]. These are the books [I bought]. ®
lit. ‘These are the books što I bought them.’
Here ih (the 3rd pers. pl. pronoun in A) serves as the object of the clause, referring
to knjige books while the word što serves as a simple conjunction. Such additional
pronoun is never added if the role in the clause is being the subject.
Recall also the example song Jugo in 35 Tools and Means, With and Without; it
contains two such constructions:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 62 The Friend I Saw: Rela!ve Clauses
364 / 600

f
VjetarN [što tuče u liceA i dušuA] The wind [that’s beating my face and soul]
Pričam o ljubavi jednojDL [što bila je davno] I’m telling about a love [that was
long ago]
It’s absolutely not required that you use this construction in speech, but be prepared
to see sometimes it in writing and maybe speech.®
There’s another colloquial thing you’ll sometimes see and hear. The
adjective/pronoun koji has the same form in masc. inanimate N and A: koji.
Nevertheless, you’ll see and hear kojeg(a) in masc. inanimate A – which is the form
for masc. animate A. For example:
FilmN [kojegA sviN čekamo: "Pedeset nijansiG siveG"]. (colloq!) The movie [we’re all
waiting for: "Fifty shades of gray"]. ®
Of course, you would expect koji in this sentence, but it’s kojeg in this example. You
can find this feature on many internet sites and in colloquial writing (Google™ for
the headline above: I found it on the internet). Teachers in schools spend a lot of
time “correcting” this – obviously, not with a complete success. Again, it’s not
required that you talk like that, but don’t panic when you hear or read such a bit
weird accusative forms!
________
® Instead of što and tko, forms šta and ko are used in Serbia and most of Bosnia;
the same applies to derived forms, e.g. netko is rather neko there.
In parts of Croatia where kaj or ča are colloquially used instead of što or šta, they
are used also after nouns, and don’t change then (and then an additional pronoun is
used in the relative clause). However, in Serbia or Bosnia, in such constructions, only
što can be used, never šta. Furthermore, such constructions seem a bit rarer in
Serbia.
Using kojeg instead of koji for masc. inanimate A is unknown in Serbia and Bosnia.
• Something Possibly Interesting
There are some fancy terms you’ll maybe encounter: the noun or pronoun the
relative clause is attached to is called antecedent; the word that starts the relative
clause is relativizer, and the additional pronoun in clause (used in rare cases when
indeclinable što is used) is called resumptive pronoun. And indeclinable što is also
called invariant relativizer (it doesn’t vary, i.e. change case). Now you can impress
your friends with some fancy words! Or forget these terms immediately.
Relative clauses starting with a pronoun which changes cases (e.g. with koji) are a
characteristic feature of European languages. Check this map in the World Atlas of
Language Structures: Relativization on Subjects.

63 Bigger and Better: Comparatives
Comparatives are forms of adjectives used to express not a property (e.g. big) but a
relative property (e.g. bigger). A comparative (short: comp.) is again an adjective.
The base form (big) is sometimes called positive.
In Croatian, most adjectives form their comparatives by adding -iji to their
dictionary form or case-base:
dosadan (dosadn-) boring → dosadniji more boring
jeftin cheap → jeftiniji cheaper
pažljiv careful → pažljiviji more careful
sretan (sretn-) happy → sretniji happier ®
star old → stariji older
Comparatives formed in this way usually have the stress on the syllable that comes
right before the added -iji (e.g. paž-lji-viji).
Unfortunately, most one-syllable adjectives have complicated alternations of their
final consonants in comparative, so their comparative form must be remembered
(or you can remember the patterns from the adjectives listed below, but you still
have to remember which adjectives have alternations and which just add -iji):
brz fast → brži
blag gentle → blaži
čist clean, pure → čišći
čvrst rigid → čvršći
dug long → duži
glup stupid → gluplji
mlad young → mlađi
skup expensive → skuplji
tih quiet → tiši
tvrd hard → tvrđi
Some one-syllable adjectives use the simpler way to create comparatives and just
add -iji. Often used ones are:
crn black
loš bad
nov new
plavi blue
pun full
rani early
slab weak
slan salty
spor slow
star old
strm steep
zdrav healthy
Many two-syllable adjectives, especially ones ending in -ak or -ok, undergo an even
greater transformation: they get shortened (e.g. lose -ok) and then go through the
consonant alternation as most one-syllable adjectives:
dalek distant → dalji
dubok deep → dublji
kratak short → kraći
nizak low → niži
širok wide → širi
težak heavy → teži
uzak narrow → uži
visok tall → viši ®
Few adjectives have completely irregular comparatives (everything so far was kind
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 63 Bigger and Be~er: Compara!ves
366 / 600

of regular, believe it or not):
dobar good → bolji
dug long → dulji
lak light, easy → lakši
lijep nice → ljepši
loš bad → gori
mali small → manji
mekan soft → mekši
velik big → veći
There’s an adjective malen with more or less the same meaning as mali small; both
use the same comparative. The same goes as mek, a bit archaic variant of mekan
soft. The opposite happens to loš bad – it has a regular comparative and an irregular
one! Both are used. The same happens to dug long, where two comparatives exist,
dulji and duži (some people claim there’s a small difference in meaning, but they are
used with the same meaning in the spoken language).
Comparatives always have the obligatory -i in nominative sing. masc., and in cases
where there’s a choice of two endings in masc. and neut. genders (i.e. o vs. e) they
always have e in endings, even širi wider. (Take care when making impersonal and
inflected forms!)
To help you remember irregular comparatives, they will be underlined with a pale
blue line, and the positive form will be printed at the right margin.
There’s an often quoted rule that -ije- is always shortened to -je- or -e- in
comparatives, but it’s not always so in real life:
blijed pale → bljeđi (sometimes: blijeđi)
lijep nice → ljepši
vrijedan valuable → vredniji / vrjedniji / vrijedniji
At least since 1950’s, comparative forms like vrijedniji more valuable have been
condemned by prescriptive grammarians (i.e. the language police) but they persist.
Currently, you can see three forms of this comparative, and the most common one
on the .hr domain of the Internet is the non-standard one (the most recent Croatian
orthography manual allows forms vredniji and vrjedniji):
form
  hits
vredniji
18700
vrjedniji
11600
vrijedniji
22900
To say that something is e.g. bigger than something else, use od¨ + G after the
comparative:
DamirN je starijiN od AneG. Damir is older than Ana.
We know now to say that something is bigger, but what about much bigger? It turns
out that with comparatives you can use the adverbs of quantity (introduced in 45
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 63 Bigger and Be~er: Compara!ves
367 / 600

m | brz
1 | dubok
velik
doći | brzo
doći
postajati
Quantities and Existence):
Tvoj autoN je mnogo bržiN. Your car is a lot faster.
DamirN je dosta starijiN od AneG. Damir is quite older than Ana.
While mnogo sounds a bit formal when expressing relative quantities in Croatian
(e.g. mnogo ljudi many people), it’s very often used with comparatives even in very
colloquial contexts.
To ask about how is something comparing to something else, use koliko / koliko
how much; the comparative is not moved:
Koliko je DamirN starijiN od AneG? How much older is Damir than Ana?
— Dosta. Quite older.
— Osam godinaG. Eight years older.
There’s a very compact expression in Croatian:
što + (comp.) ... = as (comp.) ... as possible ®
The word što doesn’t change case when used in this role – a kind of quantity adverb
– but the comparative does, of course:
Treba miDL što dubljiN lonacN. I need as deep a pot as possible.
Želimo što većuA sobuA. We want as big a room as possible.
This phrase is more restricted in Croatian than in English: it’s rarely used for
description of actual things, it’s mostly used for things required, needed, imagined
and like.
This can be used to maximize comparative adverbs; frequently used ones are:
što brže as quickly as possible
što ranije as early as possible
što prije as soon as possible
For example:
Dođi što brže! Come as quickly as possible!
You will sometimes see čim instead of što in such expressions, both with adjectives
and adverbs:
Dođi čim ranije. Come as early as possible. ®
If you want to express that something is increasing in some property, the easiest
way is to use sve before the comparative: this word means all on its own, but not in
such constructions:
MoreN postaje sve toplijeN. The sea is getting/becoming warmer and
warmer.
FilmoviN su sve dosadnijiN. Movies are more and more boring.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 63 Bigger and Be~er: Compara!ves
368 / 600

mlad
m
Another way is to use the same expression like in English, e.g. toplije i toplije (but
it’s less common); you can also combine both (e.g. sve toplije i toplije).
If you want to express a difference, you can put the difference in accusative before
the comparative, or use za¨ + A after the comparative:
MoreN je stupanjA toplijeN. The sea is warmer by one degree.
MoreN je toplijeN za stupanjA. (the same meaning)
There are two more forms that can be derived from any adjective that has a
comparative. Both are quite simple to make – just a prefix needs to be added. This
table summarizes them:
mlad young
premlad too young
(absolute superlative)
mlađi younger
najmlađi the youngest
(superlative)
In the standard stress scheme, the stress moves to the prefix, while in the ‘western’
scheme it usually stays on its original place.
Some absolute superlatives don’t have ‘excessive’ meaning at all anymore. The most
common are:
prekrasan (prekrasn-) beautiful, magnificent
prelijep beautiful, magnificent
presretan (presretn-) delighted, ecstatic
The adjectives prekrasan (prekrasn-) and prelijep have more or less the same
meaning.
There’s not much else to be told about these forms; you can specify what group you
meant with the superlative, using od¨ + G:
IgorN je najmlađiN od njene djeceG. Igor is the youngest of her children.
You can also specify the context of the absolute superlative, what for is someone
too something:
IgorN je premladN da vozi autoA. Igor too young to drive a car.
This is really merely a purpose clause, all restrictions apply.
It’s worth knowing the verb pair meaning compare:
uspoređivati (-uje) ~ usporediti («) compare ®
The pair is used in the same way as the English verb:
Usporedili smo dva filma24. We have compared the two movies.
Usporedila sam novi iPhoneA s novim SamsungomI. I have compared the new
iPhone with the new Samsung.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 63 Bigger and Be~er: Compara!ves
369 / 600

m
The last example uses s¨/sa¨ + I.
Finally, a few one-syllable adjectives have ‘total forms’, which are reduplicated and
have appended -cat. Most common are:
gol golcat all naked
nov novcat brand-new
pun puncat completely full
sam samcat all alone
Occasionally, you’ll see just the second part used (e.g. just novcat) with the same
meaning. They are, confusingly, sometimes also called ‘absolute superlatives’ in
some grammars. You cannot use this construction with any adjective – only few
one-syllable adjectives permit this.
When they are used before nouns, both parts change in case, gender and number:
OvoN su ključeviN novog novcatog autaG. These are keys of a brand-new car.
________
® In Serbia and most of Bosnia, the adjective happy has a bit different form srećan
(srećn-); the comparative is srećniji.
In everyday speech in many regions, including parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia,
višlji is used as the comparative of visok tall, high. This is not accepted as standard
anywhere, and sometimes it’s considered a hallmark of ‘uneducated’ speech.
Although što is colloquially replaced by šta, and such replacement is complete in
Bosnia and Serbia, in both the standard languages and the actual speech, it’s never
replaced in phrases što + comparative.
The phrase čim + comparative is specifically Croatian and sounds ungrammatical in
Serbia.
The verb pair uspoređivati (-uje) ~ usporediti («) compare has a slightly different
form in Serbia and most of Bosnia, without -s-, e.g. uporediti and so on.
• Something Possibly Interesting
There are basically two types of adjectives: most get -iji in comparative; a smaller
group gets -(j)i, with possible sound shifts, after they discard -ok, -ak and like. All
new adjectives get -iji, and the smaller group includes many adjectives with basic
meanings (wide, fast, deep etc.). The smaller group is likely the older one. It’s
interesting that some older cousins of Croatian, like Ancient Greek and Sanskrit,
have two ways to make comparatives too. This is very likely an ancient division.
Most older Croatian grammars list gori as the (irregular) comparative of zao (zl-)
evil. Such meaning of gori is archaic today.

64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²
Imagine you stand in front of a door, and the door starts to open. You don’t see
who is opening the door, and it could be some automatic mechanism anyway. You
would say:
The door is opening.
In English, many verbs like open can be used in two meanings: open something and
become open (this is sometimes called ‘causative alternation’).
This is not possible in Croatian for almost all verbs (you’ll also see few exceptions). If
you want to express ‘get open’, you have to use the ‘magic’ word – se²:
VrataN se otvaraju. The door is opening.
(In Croatian, the noun vrata door exists in plural only.) If you know Spanish (or a
similar Romance language) this is probably quite familiar to you. Actually, everything
that follows is more or less exactly like in Spanish – with a difference that Croatian
has only one form of se². There are also many of similarities with French, German
and Swedish, and – unfortunately – not much in comparison to English. Just
compare the sentences:
(French)
La porte s’ouvre.
(Spanish)
La puerta se abre.
(Swedish) Dörren öppnas.
 
Vrata se otvaraju.
(Swedish appends an -s to a verb, while Spanish and Croatian have free particles.
French se gets fused with the following word if it starts with a vowel.)
I’m going to call this use of se² the mediopassive (like in Spanish grammars); it’s
often also called se²-passive.
First, you should use the mediopassive when you don’t know who is doing something
(e.g. who is opening the door), it seems as if nobody caused it, or it’s not important:
KućaN se brzo prodala. The house sold quickly.
ČašaN se razbila. The glass broke.
LoptaN se probušila. The ball punctured.
Observe how kuća house is really the subject here, so past forms must be in the
feminine gender. The following sentences are examples of ‘anticausative’ – nobody
causes the ice-cream to melt, it melts ‘on its own’ (of course, the real cause is the
heat from the environment):
MoreN se ohladilo. The sea has cooled down.
SladoledN se topi. The ice-cream is melting.
This can also be expressed with passive adjectives in Croatian:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²
372 / 600

prodavati
prodavati
KućaN je brzo prodanaN. The house was sold quickly.
However, you have to use the mediopassive construction if you express something
ongoing: in the following sentence, the implied meaning is that people buy yogurt all
the time (imperfective), not that all the yogurt has sold (perfective):
JogurtN se dobro prodaje. Yogurt sells well.
Generally, passive adjectives of impf. verbs are rarely used – except for several
verbs, such as e.g. kuhan cooked, gledan watched, and so on (check 61 Cake is
Eaten: Passive Adjectives). For most impf. verbs, the se²-passive is preferred.
The kinds of passives in Croatian (one with se², another with passive adjectives)
correspond well to two kinds of passives in German, one with werden and another
with sein:
ProzorN se zatvara. = (Ger.) Das Fenster wird geschlossen.
ProzorN je zatvorenN. = (Ger.) Das Fenster ist geschlossen.
German has also the third possibility: passives with sich, that basically translate
word-for-word into Croatian se²-passive, word order aside; for example, compare
translations of this Latin phrase (which uses the passive, having here ‘on its own’, i.e.
‘medial’ meaning):
(Latin)
Omnia mutantur.     
Everything changes.
(German)
Alles ändert sich.
(Swedish) Allting förändras.  
SveN se mijenja.
Swedish has again the suffix -s appended to the verb förändra.
The se²-passive is also used to express how easy (or hard) something can be done
(without expressing who is doing it, since it’s not important anyway):
ProzorN se lako otvara. The window opens easily.
This again corresponds exactly to e.g. French reflexive passive – this example is
almost word for word:
(French) La fenêtre s’ouvre difficilement.      The window opens ‘difficultly’.
= The window is difficult to open.
ProzorN se teško otvara.
The mediopassive is also used when something is ‘for sale’, or ‘for rent’, so it’s not
sold yet:
Prodaje se kućaN. The house is for sale. (lit. ‘being sold’)
You can often see notices like prodaje se or iznajmljuje se for rent, for example:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²
373 / 600

čuti
očekivati
f
jesti
jesti
jesti
peći
Again, this is completely the same as Spanish se vende and se renta, except for the
word order.
The mediopassive is also used when someone/everyone can hear, see or expect
something:
NeštoN se čuje. Something is heard.
MjesecN se vidio. The Moon could be seen.
Očekuje se snijegN. Snow is expected.
Such sentences translate as English passives (is heard). However, they don’t
completely correspond to English passives, since in English you can usually add by
whom:
The Moon could be seen by them.
This is completely impossible in Croatian: if you want to say this, you’ll have to
rephrase the sentence as they could see the Moon, etc.
Perf-like verbs verbs of perception, i.e. vidjeti see and čuti (čuje) hear, when used in
mediopassive, behave as imperfective verbs – you can express the time period:
DimN se vidio satimaI. The smoke could be seen for hours.
BukaN se čula cijelu noćA. The noise could be heard the whole night.
Next, you should use it when there’s a group of people that does something, maybe
even everybody, at least in some area:
U ArgentiniDL se govori španjolskiN. Spanish is spoken in Argentina.
U JapanuDL se jede rižaN. Rice is eaten in Japan.
Such sentences also usually correspond to English passive sentences (is spoken), and
to the same construction in Spanish (se habla español en Argentina). Sometimes
such sentences are rephrased with ljudi m pl. people, e.g:
U ArgentiniDL ljudiN govore španjolskiA. People in Argentina speak Spanish.
U JapanuDL ljudiN jedu rižuA. People in Japan eat rice.
(The same rephrasing can be used in Spanish, with la gente.)
This is also used when you want to say what is the custom, or how people should do
something:
JuhaN se jede žlicomI. Soup is eaten with a spoon.
Again, such sentences usually correspond to English passive sentences (is eaten).
Some sentences are ambiguous, for example the following sentence could be a part
of recipe or simply a statement what’s going on in the oven:
MesoN se peče dva sata24. Meat is roasting for two hours.
The French ‘reflexive passive’ has the same use:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²
374 / 600

ići past-n
moći pres-1
vjerovati
očekivati
moći past-n
(French) Ça ne se fait pas.  
lit. It’s not done.
= People don’t do that.
ToN se ne radi.
Sometimes, such sentences don’t have any subject (as some verbs, e.g. go don’t
permit an object), so English sentences must use people, they or some other way.
Such sentences are impersonal in Croatian, so neuter singular forms must be used in
the past:
Ovdje se ne puši°. There’s no smoking here. (lit. ‘It’s not smoked here.’)
Nekad se često išlo u kinoA. People were going to cinema often.
Puno se popilo. They drank a lot.
(Spanish uses again exactly the same construction, the first sentence corresponds to
aquí no se fuma, which has only a slightly different word order.)
For example, this sign on a small diner in Zagreb says lit. ‘at our place it’s eaten the
best’ = people eat here the best:
German again has the same feature (but with werden-passive), while Swedish has
the -s passive here:
(German)
Es wurde die ganze Nacht getanzt.      
lit. ‘It was danced all night.’
(Swedish) Det dansades hela natten.
Plesalo se cijelu noćA.
All three sentences mean, of course, they/people were dancing all night. Please
remember such sentences are impersonal in Croatian, i.e. no subject is allowed in
them. (Latin also uses passive impersonally, e.g. in Virgil Sic itur ad astra.)
Often, content clauses are subject of such sentences, English again uses the dummy
it, and passives with some verbs (content sentences behave as neuter singular
subjects, exactly as to):
Čini se da… It seems that…
Može se reći da… It can be said that...
Vjeruje se da… It’s believed that...
Očekuje se da… It’s expected that...
Činilo se da… It seemed that…
Moglo se reći da… It could be said that...
The sentences above look impersonal, but the content clauses are actually subjects.
Since the clauses are neither nouns nor pronouns, the verb goes to neuter singular in

the past tense, as if it were impersonal, so behavior is actually the same.
To summarize, there are two main uses of this construction:
1. when something happens "on its own";
2. when English uses passive as well (is seen, are expected).
Finally, there’s a rather surprising use of DL in such sentences. With many verbs, it’s
possible to say that you feel like doing something, or you have a need to do
something (even against your will!).
The following examples will illustrate it – of course, instead of mi² and Ani (DL of
Ana) you can use any pronoun or noun standing for a person (or animal) in the DL
case. The verbs are almost always imperfective, because such expressions are about
activities and states, and not accomplishments. The following common expressions
stand for unpleasant feelings:
Povraća° miDL se. I feel like throwing up.
Vrti° miDL se. I’m dizzy.
AniDL se povraćalo. Ana felt like throwing up.
The second sentence uses the verb vrtjeti/vrtiti spin. (Bear in mind that the
sentences are again impersonal, as the past tense reminds you.) The following
expressions are more pleasant:
Pije° miDL se. I feel like drinking.
Puši° miDL se. I need to smoke.
Ne pleše° miDL se. I don’t feel like dancing.
AniDL se spava°. Ana is sleepy.
Ne ide° miDL se na posaoA. I don’t feel like going to work.
If you express what you feel like drinking/eating, it becomes the subject, so the verb
must be adjusted accordingly:
Pije miDL se čajN. I feel like drinking tea.
Jedu miDL se kolačiN. I feel like eating cakes.
Compare the previous sentences in the past tense:
Pilo miDL se. I felt like drinking.
AniDL se spavalo. Ana was sleepy.
Nije miDL se išlo na posaoA. I didn’t feel like going to work.
Pio miDL se čajN. I felt like drinking tea.
Jeli su miDL se kolačiN. I felt like eating cakes.
This is yet another use of the DL case to express feelings.
So, you finally know how to sell your house and to express that you don’t feel like
dancing!
What about exceptions to use of se²? There are couple of common verbs that
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²
376 / 600

pisati
pisati
pisati
f
1
sometimes behave as English open. A common verb with this property is svirati play
(music) (the English verb play is used in the same way):
Svirala je neka dosadna pjesmaN. A boring song was playing.
Another verb is pisati (piše) write. For instance, if you would like to say that
something "is written" in a book, you should not use the se²:
Ovdje piše da… It’s written here that…
U knjiziDL piše istinaN. The truth is written in the book.
The English verb write has to be used as passive, it’s unlike open. Note that istina
truth is the subject of the second sentence, while the first one has a content clause
as its subject. Therefore, the first is in neuter in past, and the second one is
feminine:
Ovdje je pisalo da... It was written here that…
U knjiziDL je pisala istinaN. The truth was written in the book.
Yet another very common verb with this property is trebati need/should; it’s used
without se² with infinitives and content sentences (and impersonal meaning):
Trebalo je reći da... It should have been said that...
If you want to express how something is customary done, you have to use se² with
these verbs too:
Njegovo imeN se ne piše tako. His name is not written like that.
• Examples
This pop song, Tvoje lice se promijenilo Your face has changed, performed by

One verse has mediopassive se², meaning that the face has changed, while another
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²
377 / 600

has A me², which is the object – the face changed me. Croatian packs a lot of
meaning in such short words.
The verse I čitav svijet za koji znam is, of course, a relative clause, introduced in 62
The Friend I Saw: Relative Clauses.
The verse Ljubav je nestala za dan contains a ‘time frame’ for the perf. verb nestati
(nestane) disappear: za dan in a day. This is an example where the time-phrase-rule
(check 49 For 7 Hours: Definite Periods) is relaxed if za¨ is used. The full form would
of course be za jedan dan.

donijeti past-f
65 Carry, Bring, Drive: Transport Verbs
I will now introduce three important verb families that mostly do with transport,
that is, carrying, bringing, leading and driving, including some fairly distantly related
meanings.
The families are not symmetric: there’s no base pair. The first family is derived from
nositi carry. Derived verbs look like this, and perf. verbs are very irregular:
nositi carry
donositi («) ~ donijeti (donese, donio, donijela) bring ®
The basic verb means not just carry, but also wear:
GoranN nosi plavu majicuA. Goran is wearing a blue T-shirt.
If you now don’t understand how we distinguish carry and wear – we usually don’t
have to. With clothes and similar items (shoes, hats) the meaning wear is assumed.
The base verb is perfectly regular, so are derived impf. verbs. However, all perf.
verbs are irregular, and derived from forms not used on their own. For instance:
AnaN je donijela vinoA. Ana brought wine.
This verb, and all derived from it, use destinations and origins:
AnaN je donijela sendvičA GoranuDL. Ana brought Goran a sandwich.
Common verbs that follow this pattern are:
-nositi («) ~
  -nijeti (-nese, -nio, -nijela)
prefix

A (DL)
bring (here)
pre-

A (DL)
bring* (perf.)
A (od¨ G)
take away
u-
A
bring in
pod-
A
tolerate, can stand
po-
not a pair! (specific meanings)
The optional DL used with these verbs means, as expected, the person who will
receive something (in A).
The perf. verb odnijeti (etc.) is used as a perf. counterpart of nositi, to express that
carrying something to someone is completed, i.e. when something is brought or
delivered.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 65 Carry, Bring, Drive: Transport Verbs
379 / 600

The difference between the od- and do- pairs derived from nositi is exactly the
same as with similar verbs derived from ići (i.e. odlaziti vs. dolaziti):
do- come + bring
od- go + take
The verb pair derived with pre- covers also the meaning transfer (interestingly,
English transfer is ultimately from the Latin verb trāns-ferō, which is the exact
translation of pre-nositi):
KomarciN prenose bolestiA. Mosquitoes transfer diseases.
The verb pair derived with pod- has a bit unexpected meaning; it usually
corresponds to English tolerate or can + stand (someone/something):
AnaN ne podnosi komarceA. Ana can’t stand mosquitoes.
Furthermore, there are a couple of unexpected things: first, the verb odnositi («)
when used with se² – only the impf. verb – has the following meanings:
odnositi («) se²
  + na¨ + A relate, refer to A, be about A
  + prema + DL behave towards DL, treat DL
For example:
Loše se odnosio prema meniDL. He behaved badly towards me.
This verb, with na¨ + A, is often used where English uses apply and similar verbs:
PopustN se odnosi na sve majiceA. The discount ‘relates to’ all T-shirts. (= applies to)
Next, the prefix po- creates two verbs that don’t form a pair:
ponositi («) se² (I) be proud (of I)
ponijeti (ponese, ponio, ponijela) perf. take* (with someone)
The perf. verb ponijeti (etc.) is used when someone takes something with him or
her:
AnaN je ponijela laptopA. Ana took the laptop with her.
Basically the same meaning can be expressed also with the pair uzimati ~ uzeti
(uzme), but it has additional meanings (take something from someone), while
ponijeti (etc.) does not.
There’s one more verb pair in this family I haven’t listed, derived with do-pri-: it
means contribute.
Colloqually, in Zagreb, Rijeka and the surrounding regions – roughly western and
northwestern Croatia – you will sometimes hear another (colloquial) form of
infinitive for perf. verbs from this family: odnesti and so on.
The perf. verbs in this family have two forms of passive adjectives (I have omitted

dovesti past-f
dovesti past-f
donijeti past-f

odvesti past-f
odnijeti past-f
povesti past-f
present and past forms):
donijeti (...) perf. bring → donijet / donesen
odnijeti (...) perf. carry away → odnijet / odnesen
etc.
Beside these two standard forms for each verb, you’ll often see and hear one more
form: donešen, odnešen, etc. Each form prevails in speech in various regions.
There are two more verbs families that are quite similar to the previous family. They
are derived from the following verbs:
voditi lead
voziti drive
The verbs have more regular forms than ones derived from nositi, but the perf.
verbs look very similar:
dovoditi («) ~ dovesti (dovede, doveo) bring (someone)
dovoziti («) ~ dovesti (doveze, dovezao, dovezla) bring (by driving)
Although voditi on its own means lead in all its meanings – in a game, a race, and
someone, showing the way – in the derived verbs it’s always taking, bringing...
another person (including animals, pets especially):
AnaN je dovela svog brataA. Ivana brought her brother.
IvanaN je dovela svog psaA. Ivana brought her dog.
Compare this with the use of the corresponding verb derived from nositi:
IvanaN je donijela svoju gitaruA. Ivana brought her guitar.
Strictly speaking, verbs derived from voditi are used if one lead/brought was moving
on their own; verbs derived from nositi imply carrying. If she had brought a hrčak
(hrčk-) hamster, verbs derived from nositi would be used, since the hamster likely
didn’t walk beside her all the way, but was carried:
IvanaN je donijela svog hrčkaA. Ivana brought her hamster.
An interesting exception are babies and little children: for them, verbs derived from
voditi are always used, even if they are too young to walk!®
Like the verb pair derived from nositi, the perf. verb derived with od- is often used in
as the perf. counterpart of the base verb:
AnaN je odvela GoranaA u školuA. Ana took Goran to school.
AnaN je odnijela knjigeA u školuA. Ana took books to school.
As with nositi, with the prefix po-, there are no verb pairs: only perf. verbs are used
in the meaning take. Their meaning is subtle: the subject is going somewhere
anyway (and it’s often not expressed where), and he or she is taking something or
someone (again, who moves on their own) with them:
AnaN je povela psaA. Ana took the dog with her.

AnaN je ponijela knjiguA. Ana took a book with her.
The verb pair derived from voditi with pre-, besides rare literal meaning, has
another, but very common meaning – translate:
DarioN je preveo pismoA. Dario has translated the letter.
The pre- pair uses origins and destinations, including when used as translate, so pay
attention that languages use prepositions s¨ / sa¨ + G and na¨ + A:
AnaN je prevela porukuA s njemačkogG na hrvatskiA. Ana has
translated the message from German to Croatian.

Meanings indicated by an asterisk (*) have corresponding verbs derived from nositi:
the difference is that who or what is brought must be moving on its own, while verbs
derived from nositi imply carrying.
The verb pair derived with u- has an unexpected meaning: introduce:
HrvatskaN nije uvela euroA. Croatia haven’t introduced the euro.
Likewise, the verb pair derived with iz- has a quite unexpected meaning: perform. It’s
not used without an object, you have to say what is performed:
OniN će izvesti nekoliko pjesamaG. They will perform several songs.
To express perform without an object, use the verb pair:
nastupati («) ~ nastupiti («) perform, take stage
For example:
GoranN nastupa u školiDL. Goran is performing in school.
Finally, two verb pairs, derived with pro- and pro-iz- have quite unexpected
meanings. The first pair means spend time (with someone, at some place) – with it,
you have to say what time is spent (in A) – two days, a night, a morning, etc.:

Proveli smo dva dana24 u DubrovnikuDL. We spent two days in

Provest ću jutroA u vlakuDL. I’ll spend the morning in the train.
This pair is not used to spend money (or other material resources, e.g. paper, cloth,
salt...); for such kind of spending, another pair is used:
trošiti ~ po- («) spend (money, resources)
This is the same difference as French passer vs. dépenser, German verbringen vs.
aufwenden or Spanish pasar vs. gastar.
The second pair, with pro-iz-, means produce, mostly in industrial ways (I’ve used
here the mediopassive, introduced in 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²):
Ovi laptopiN se proizvode u KiniDL. These laptops are manufactured in China. (lit.
‘are being manufactured’)
The derived pass. adj. (of the perf. verb) is used as the translation of made in:
proizvedeno + (location). Note the stress of pass. adj. – it applies to all pass.
adjectives derived from perf. verbs this family – always on -e-:
izvesti (...) perf. perform → izveden
uvesti (...) perf. introduce → uveden etc.
The verb pairs derived from voziti drive have similar meaning to ones derived from
nositi and voditi, but the emphasis is on driving: a vehicle (including ships and
airplanes!) must be involved:
AnaN je odvezla GoranaA u školuA. Ana drove Goran to school.
The verb voziti can be used with A (drive something or someone, or se², when the
meaning is mediopassive – we don’t know who’s driving really:
AnaN vozi autoA. Ana is driving the car.
AnaN se vozi. Ana is driving (in a car).
Most verbs in the family derived from voziti must have a subject in A or a se²:
AnaN je odvezla GoranaA u školuA. Ana drove Goran to school.
AnaN se odvezla u školuA. Ana drove to school.
Now, the verb pair derived from voziti with pre- has only the simple meaning –
transport:
TrajektiN prevoze auteA. Ferries transport cars.
As in two other families, the perf. verb derived with po- means while driving
somewhere, take someone/something with, but it’s less often used than other two
verbs.
With u- and iz-, besides the expected meanings drive into and drive out, the derived
verb pairs have meanings import and export:

® In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, which completely dominates in Serbia, verb pairs

66 Smoking is Dangerous: Verbal Nouns
English uses -ing forms for more than one purpose. Compare the sentences:
(1) I am swimming.
(2) I like swimming.
(3) Swimming is healthy.
In sentences #2 and #3, swimming can be replaced with to swim or even apples (I
like apples, apples are healthy.). The word swimming behaves similar to a noun in
these two sentences. Croatian has a special noun (derived from verbs) that’s used in
sentences like #2 and #3: verbal noun or gerund.
It’s basically derived from the pass. adjective. Most of them end in -n; we change it
to -nje and that’s the noun we need:
Volim plivanjeA. I like swimming.
PlivanjeN je zdravoN. Swimming is healthy.
But there’s really no passive adjective ‘plivan’, right? Right. The passive adjective is
just a formal step. You can skip it if you think it’s meaningless, but it’s worth
remembering that differences between pass. adjectives and gerunds are small,
especially when you recall all consonant alternations in passive adjectives. Formally
it goes like this:
verb
pass. adj.
gerund
pušiti smoke →
pušen →
pušenje
čistiti clean →
čišćen →
čišćenje
We can summarize rules for pass. adjectives and gerunds in one nice table:
inf
pres-3
pass. adj.
gerund
-ati
doesn’t
matter
-an
-anje
-nuti
-nut
-nuće
-eti
-et
-eće
other
-e
-en
-enje
-i
*-en
*-enje
The verbs ending in -jeti (e.g. vidjeti) fall into the ‘other’ row.
The asterisk (*) in the table above signalizes a shift of the preceding consonant(s),
e.g. t → ć, c → č, etc. Of course, not all words that can be derived according to this
scheme are really used.
Gerunds enables us to say:
PušenjeN je opasnoN. Smoking is dangerous.
TrčanjeN je zdravoN. Running is healthy.

When a verb uses an object in accusative, the matching gerund, if it has a noun
serving as an object, will use the genitive case instead:
Perem kosuA. (A) I’m washing my hair.
PranjeN koseG je dosadnoN. (G) Washing hair is boring.
The opposite holds for verbs that cannot have objects at all – the noun in genitive
after the gerund stands for a subject:
LišćeN pada. (N) Leaves are falling.
Volim padanjeA lišćaG. (G) ‘I like falling of leaves.’
Objects in other cases are sometimes changed to na¨ + A:
Sjećam se njeG. (G) I remember her.
sjećanje na njuA (na¨ + A) memory of her
Some gerunds have specific meanings and are no longer felt connected to verbs.
Common ones, derived from impf. verbs, are:
mišljenje opinion
pitanje question
putovanje travel, trip
značenje meaning
znanje knowledge
There are also verbal nouns with specific meanings derived from perf. verbs:
iznenađenje surprise
objašnjenje explanation
obećanje promise
olakšanje relief
opravdanje excuse
osvježenje refreshment
upozorenje warning
stanje state
uzbuđenje excitement
There are more, this is not an exhaustive list by any means. Some words have a bit
different stress when they have a specific meaning. The same thing happened to
some English forms, e.g. painting is derived from paint, but it has a specific meaning
as well.
For some reasons I never really understood, some verbs don’t use this pattern at all.
For instance, you would expect that from the verb patiti suffer there’s a gerund
‘paćenje’, but there isn’t. There are a couple of other patterns to get gerund-like
nouns. One is to add -nja to the verb, after discarding -ti and the vowel before it
(some consonants are shifted as well):
mrziti hate → mržnja ®
patiti suffer → patnja
paziti be careful → pažnja
prijetiti threaten → prijetnja
šetati stroll → šetnja
voziti drive → vožnja
Two more verbs have such gerund-like nouns:
štedjeti/štediti (štedi) save (money) → štednja
šutjeti/šutiti (šuti) be silent → šutnja ®
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 66 Smoking is Dangerous: Verbal Nouns
386 / 600

One common verb uses both the regular way and adding -nja:
graditi build →
građenje
gradnja
Another way is to change verbs ending in -avati (pres-3 -aje) to -aja:
prodavati (prodaje) sell → prodaja
udavati (udaje) se² marry (woman to man) → udaja
Impf. verbs derived from ići (...) go and similar motion verbs have usually gerund-like
nouns in -ak which turns into just an -k- before any case ending:
dolaziti come → dolazak (dolask-) arrival
odlaziti leave → odlazak (dolask-) departure
There are more common verbs that follow this pattern, some of them perfective:
početi (počne) perf. begin → početak (početk-) beginning
rastati (rastane) se² perf. separate → rastanak (rastank-) parting, farewell
sastati (sastane) se² perf. meet → sastanak (sastank-) meeting
Therefore, sastanak (sastank-) meeting is just a gerund-like noun derived from a
verb.
Some verbs (with inf in -iti) derive verbal nouns by adding -ba or -dba; common ones
are:
boriti se² fight → borba fight
ploviti sail, navigate → plovidba navigation
usporediti («) perf. compare → usporedba comparison ®
There is the verbal noun plovljenje, but it’s very rarely used.
The transport verbs (ones derived from nositi carry, voditi lead and voziti drive)
often have root verbal nouns, that is, with forms having just -nos, -vod and -voz,
without any additional ending:
odnositi («) se² relate → odnos relation
ponositi («) se² be proud → ponos pride
izvoziti («) export → izvoz export (noun)
If the underlying verbs have the prefix pre-, it’s changed to prije- in the verbal nouns:
prevoditi («) translate → prijevod translation
prevoziti («) transport → prijevoz transport (noun)
However, the noun prijevod really means the result, and not the process – there’s
the regular verbal noun prevođenje for the process – therefore, it’s really another
type of the verbal noun, associated with the perfective aspect, the outcome.
There are more verb pairs which have two associated verbal nouns – the ‘perfective’
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 66 Smoking is Dangerous: Verbal Nouns
387 / 600

napasti perf-m
one is usually a root noun:
impf.
 perf.
verbs
padati
~ pasti (padne, pao) fall
nouns
padanje falling pad fall (noun)
Similar ‘perf.’ root verbal nouns are:
doprinos contribution
ispit exam
napad attack
potpis signature
razvod divorce
uvod introduction
Objects of napasti (...) attack are changed with na¨ + A when you use the
‘perfective’ verbal noun (this is the same as in English):
NapoleonN je napao RusijuA. (A) Napoleon attacked Russia.
napad na RusijuA (na¨ + A) attack on Russia
There are some impf. verbs that have root verbal nouns; common ones are:
boljeti (boli,...) ache, cause pain → bol f pain
izgledati («) appear, look, seem → izgled look, appearance
raditi work / do → rad work
Some verbs have verbal nouns in -a, or completely irregular verbal nouns; for
example:
verb
noun
bojati (boji) se² be afraid of
strah fear
brinuti (brine) (se²) care, worry
briga worry, care
trebati need / should
potreba need
namjeravati («) intend
namjera intention
željeti (želi,...) want, desire
želja wish
Finally, some verbs have no verbal noun at all:
čuti (čuje) hear
ići (ide, išao, išla) go
There are no underlying rules which method should be used for a verb, so it’s better
to just remember verbal nouns as words on their own, more or less connected to
the base verb.
Sometimes there’s a need to express the subject of the action expressed by a noun
which matches the verb which uses objects. When the verb permits no objects, it’s
easy (see above). But what about most verbs? Then – mostly in writing, legal
documents, etc. – the way is to add od¨ + G (lit. ‘from’) or, controversially, od strane
+ G (lit. ‘from the side of’):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 66 Smoking is Dangerous: Verbal Nouns
388 / 600

OvoN je prijevodN od strane sudskog tumačaG. This is a translation by a court
interpreter.
This construction is controversial, especially with strane, but you will find it in
writing.
It seems that relational adjectives can usually be derived from root verbal nouns by
adding -ni:
ispit exam → ispitni
rad work → radni
izvoz export (noun) → izvozni
uvod introduction → uvodni
However, relational adjectives cannot be derived from ordinary most other verbal
nouns, especially not from regular ones. Nouns that are used-for-something are
described with za¨ + verbal noun:
naočale za čitanje reading glasses
daska za peglanje ironing board (lit. ‘plank’)
papir za pečenje baking paper
The first expression literally means glasses for reading, the second one plank for
ironing, and the third one paper for baking.
When you use verbal nouns as a location, that is, you’re ‘in’ or ‘on’ something, some
verbal nouns use u¨, especially if it’s a solitary, or short activity:
AnaN i GoranN su u šetnjiDL. Ana and Goran went for a walk. (lit. ‘are in a walk’)
However, most verbal nouns, especially when they involve more people, are
organized, scheduled, done in shops or offices, and so on, use the preposition na¨:
GoranN je na šišanjuDL. lit. ‘Goran is on a haircut.’ (at the hairdresser’s)
Verbal nouns or derived relational adjectives are not used for expressions like
English flying saucers (saucers that fly): for that, so-called present adjectives are
used. They will be introduced in 80 Present Adverbs and Adjectives.
________
® In Serbia, the verb mrziti hate has the unexpected “Ekavian” form mrzeti (mrzi),
but the gerund-like noun is the same: mržnja.
Instead of the verb šutjeti/šutiti be silent, the verb ćutati (ćuti) is used Serbia and
often in Bosnia as well.
The verb usporediti («) perf. compare has slightly different forms in Serbia and most
of Bosnia, without -s-: uporediti («) and porediti («). From the latter verb, the verbal
noun poređenje is derived.

67 Only, Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion
There’s a set of often used words in Croatian that are used for restriction, inclusion
and exclusion. Two basic words are:
samo only
osim except ®
The word samo is quite easy to use: just insert it before any part of the sentence to
express meaning only:
Pojest ću samo salatuA. I’ll eat only the salad.
Otišli smo samo u kinoA. We went only to the cinema. ®
Poslao sam razglednicuA samo mamiDL. I sent a picture postcard only to my mum.
Samo AnaN je ovdje. Only Ana is here.
As you can see, the word samo doesn’t affect the words following it.
The word osim is similar; it’s mostly used with ‘total pronouns’ (don’t forget that
they change through cases!):
svi... osim...
everyone... except...
sve... osim...
everything... except...
nitko... osim...  nobody... except...
ništa... osim... nothing... except...
There’s one important difference between samo and osim: when osim is used
before nouns (or adjectives + nouns), it affects them if they are in A or N and
changes them into the genitive case. (That’s why osim is frequently listed as a
preposition used with G; actually, it’s a word that doesn’t fit into any category.) To
illustrate this:
Pojest ću sveA osim salateG. (A → G) I’ll eat (up) everything except the salad.
Poslao sam razglednicuA svimaDL osim mamiDL. I sent a picture postcard to everyone
except my mum.
Check how the noun in the sentence about postcards stays in the DL case. The
change also happens in the nominative case:
SviN su ovdje osim AneG. (N → G) Everyone’s here except for Ana.
Of course, osim can be used with ‘total adverbs’ as well:
svugdje... osim... everywhere... except...
uvijek... osim...
always... except...
nigdje... osim...
nowhere... except...
nikad(a)... osim...  never... except...
etc.
Another word, umjesto, is used in a very similar way to osim. It means instead of:
Otišli smo u kinoA umjesto u restoranA. We went to the cinema
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 67 Only, Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion
391 / 600

otići
ići
instead of restaurant.
Pojest ću salatuA umjesto jabukeG. (A → G) I’ll eat salad instead of an apple.
IvanN je ovdje umjesto AneG. (N → G) Ivan is here instead of Ana.
However, you will sometimes see that A is retained after umjesto, and that G is used
when the original case could be retained.
Now, there’s a major difference between English and Croatian grammar when
umjesto instead of is used with verbs. English here has to use a gerund (ing-form)
after instead of, while Croatian uses da + clause:
GoranN je ostao u krevetuDL umjesto da ode u školuA. Goran stayed in bed
instead of going to school.
(It seems that the clause after da can here be in either present or past tense, but
perfective verbs are allowed in the present tense, as in the example above!)
There’s also the version umjesto što; there are more conjunctions that can be used
with što and da, with a bit different meanings. Details will be explained in 77 As If:
Advanced Clauses.
Both osim and umjesto can be used to refer to things previously said: as you
hopefully know, in Croatian the general reference is to. We use it after those words
(changed to G, of course) to start sentences:
Osim togaG, pada kišaN. Besides, it’s raining.
Umjesto togaG, idemo u kinoA. Instead, we’re going to the cinema.
While English instead is often found at the end of a sentence, Croatian umjesto
toga is usually at the front.
There’s another conjunction we met before – i¨. It’s placed before the word that
adds to what is known or what has been said before.
Volim kavuA. I like coffee. ®
Volim i čajA. I like tea as well.
I IvanN voli kavuA. Ivan likes coffee as well.
It’s similar to English too (placed after what is added), but it’s more strict than in
English: i¨ must be placed before the added thing:
I AnaN voli čajA. Ana too likes tea.
AnaN voli i čajA. Ana likes tea too.
While the English Ana likes tea too is a bit ambiguous, Croatian Ana voli i čaj is
precise: she likes other drinks, and additionally tea.
What is added must be emphasized, that is, pronouns must not be left out, and
stressed forms must be used:
I jaN volim kavuA. I like coffee as well.
I njimaDL se sviđa filmN. They like the movie as well. (or: They, too, like the movie.)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 67 Only, Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion
392 / 600

3m/n
2
It’s absolutely impossible to add i¨ before a second-position form, e.g. normal A of
pronouns (e.g. “vidim i te”). Regardless of placement, you have to use stressed
forms after i¨ (e.g. vidim i tebe).
It’s possible to put i¨ in front of the verb, meaning something will happen (or be
done by someone) in addition:
AnaN će posjetiti RimA. Ana will visit Rome.
Tamo će i prespavati. She will sleep for a night there as well.
If the sentence is negative (that is, the verb is negated) the negative ni¨ must be
used:
Ni jaN ne volim kavuA. I don’t like coffee either.
Ni njimaDL se ne sviđa filmN. They don’t like the movie either.
(You will find this rule a bit relaxed in real life, so you will sometimes hear just i¨ in
negated sentences. Standard Croatian actually prescribes using i¨ before negative
words like ne¨.)
As with i¨, stressed forms are mandatory after ni¨ when you use pronouns.
The words i¨ and ni¨ are often used in short responses, when you agree what was
said (but ni¨ is used when you agree with something that used negation):
Volim čajA. I like tea.
— I jaN. Me too.
Ne volim vinoA. I don’t like wine.
— Ni jaN. Me neither.
Note that Croatian doesn’t change case as English does (i.e. me instead of I)
The conjunction ni¨ before the negated verb (or past form, infinitive) is often used to
emphasize negation:
Nije gaA ni vidjela. She didn’t even see him. (or it, depending on the context)
Neću teA ni pitati. I won’t even ask you.
It can be placed also before an singular object in negated sentences, most often
when using imati have – the object then usually goes into the G, to emphasize
negation:
Nemam ni kuneG. I don’t have a single kuna. (Croatian money unit)
There’s the word niti which further emphasizes exclusion and negation, and often
translates as actually, i.e. contrary to someone’s expectations (such use is a bit
colloquial):
Niti ne želim čekati. (colloq.) I don’t want to wait at all. ®
There’s another word with the same "addition" effect, it’s less used in speech, more
in writing:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 67 Only, Except, Too: Inclusion and Exclusion
393 / 600

reći past-m
također also, as well ®
This word can be placed like opet, basically anywhere in the sentence; it does not
refer to a particular word or phrase, so it corresponds to English also and as well:
IvanN također voli kavuA. Ivan likes coffee as well.
Colloquially, the word također is often used to strengthen i¨, so you’ll often hear
and sometimes read također i¨.
Another word is frequently used to emphasize i¨, when you want to "add" to
something what is already considerably large – još:
Pojeo je još i kolačA. After everything else, he ate a cake as well.
If you want to emphasize that you’re adding so much, no more, use još samo (or
samo još):
Želim još samo jednu jabukuA. I want only one apple more.
Želim samo još jednu jabukuA. (the same meaning)
Generic Croatian adjectives can be usually used as pronouns. However, the adjective
sam alone cannot be used as a pronoun. Instead, another adjective/pronoun must
be used: jedin only one, single.
We’re also capable to ask about addition. It’s quite simple, just add još to questions;
the usual position is before the verb:
ŠtoA još želite? What else (besides previously said) would you like?
This can be added to any who/what/where/how question, but it implies something is
already known, we want to know the rest:
KogaA si još vidio? Who else did you saw?
ŠtoA još znaš? What else do you know? (besides already told)
Gdje ste još bili? Where else have you been? (besides places you already told)
Besides that word, words to and sve can be added to questions in a similar manner,
and then they behave like adverbs, i.e. don’t change; as with još, they are usually put
before the verb:
ŠtoA si to čuo? What did you hear? (I saw/know you heard something)
ŠtoA si to rekao? What did you say? (I heard you said something)
KogaA si sve vidio? Who did you saw? (tell me all)
ŠtoA sve znaš? What do you know? (tell me all)
The word to restricts the question to something specific, known to the person who
asks the question, something that’s going on or has just happened. Another example
is that somebody has a photo from vacation on their living room wall, and you ask
him or her, Gdje si to bio? the question being about specifically the picture you’re
standing before.

The word sve means that we want a complete answer, i.e. all the places someone
visited, all the people someone met, everything somebody knows, and so on.
This table summarizes the three context adverbs for who/what/where/how
questions:
who/what/where/how context adverbs
to
the current moment, situation
još
in addition to previously said/discussed/known
sve
totality: want to know everything
The word još can be placed before an indefinite pronoun, for example:
još nešto something in addition
još netko somebody in addition
još negdje somewhere in addition
još nekako in an additional way
For example, a waiter or waitress will usually ask you:
Želite li još neštoA? Would you like something ‘in addition’? (i.e. beside things already
ordered)
Još neštoA? (colloquially shortened, the same meaning)
Another example:
Poznaješ li još nekogA? Do you know somebody else? (beside ones you
already said you know)
Treba miDL još neštoN. I need something more. (beside things I already said/took)
This has more specific meaning than adding the adjective drugi other after indefinite
pronouns (or the appropriate adverb), which can mean either replacement or
addition, but the default meaning is replacement:
nešto drugo something else
netko drugi somebody else
negdje drugdje somewhere else
nekako drugačije in some other way
For example:
Treba miDL nešto drugoN. I need something else. (instead)

® In Serbia, besides osim, the word sem is also used, with the exactly same meaning
and grammatical properties.
Instead of kino and kava, words bioskop and kafa prevail in Serbia and most of
Bosnia for cinema and coffee. In Bosnia, especially in parts where Bosniaks (Bosnian
Muslims) live, another word is also used for coffee: kahva.
The word niti is not used in Serbia to emphasize negation, and it’s rare in Bosnia;
such use is considered specifically Croatian.

The word također is almost always in Serbia and usually in Bosnia shortened to
takođe.
• Something Possibly Interesting
Why does English switch case in responses like me too, while Croatian doesn’t? It
seems that the default case of pronouns in English is the object case (a.k.a. the
accusative case). The subject case is used only when the pronoun is the single-word
subject placed before the verb in the same sentence; otherwise, object case is used
in English. This explains forms like:
You and me are going to... (not a single-word subject)
Who was it? — Me. (no verb)
Lucky me is.... (not a single-word subject)
Of course, this is not really the explanation: this is just a rule, we have described
what is going on in grammar terms, but we still don’t know why such rule applies at
all! (Due credits go to Arnold Zwicky on the Language Log.)

68 Three Men: Group Numbers
So far we have learned cardinal numbers (one, two), ordinal numbers (first, second),
fractional numbers (half, third), and collective numbers (another set of one, two,
used with some nouns).
Croatian has more numbers: this set actually consists of collective nouns which
stand for groups of males. They are listed here:
both obojica
2 dvojica
3 trojica
4 četvorica
5 petorica
6 šestorica
7 sedm-orica
etc.
The pattern for larger numbers is: take an ordinal adjective (e.g. osm-i), remove the
final -i and add either -ero or -orica.
You will sometimes hear versions of these numbers with -oro (e.g. četvoro). They
are very common in Bosnia and Serbia, and heard in Croatia as well.
The noun dvojica really stands for two men (or two boys — two males of any kind
really). The same holds for all other nouns listed above. The nouns are mass nouns,
i.e. they are in singular, despite meaning plurality, and change like any other singular
nouns on -a:
Razgovarao sam s obojicomI. I talked to both men. (or both boys)
Actually, the nouns obojica, dvojica, etc. behave exactly like djeca and braća: they
require verbs in plural, despite being in feminine singular. Compare:
DjecaN su otišla. Children left.
ObojicaN su otišla. Both men left.
These numbers give us another possibility: you can express counted pronouns, like us
two. As you probably expect, the pronoun will be in the genitive case, and the form
of the number will depend on the gender, but there’s one twist you probably didn’t
expect: pronouns come before numbers. The forms are:
all-male
mixed
all-female
nas obojica
nas oboje
nas obje
nas dvojica
nas dvoje
nas dvije
nas trojica
nas troje
nas tri
etc.
You get the system: for all-male groups, the specific collective nouns listed above
are used; for all-female groups, regular (cardinal) numbers in the feminine gender;
for mixed groups, the collective numbers. Colloquially, the mixed sex pattern is very
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 68 Three Men: Group Numbers
397 / 600

often used even for all-male and all-female groups.
The constructions above can mean either e.g. us two or two of us. However, there’s
a variation, if two of us stands for two out of a larger group of us (e.g. there are five
of us in total, and two of us should do something...). In such a case you can use
either:
dvoje nasG two of us, out of a larger group
dvoje od nasG (the same, but a bit more precise)
Of course, instead of nas, you can use vas or njih (stressed forms must be used) to
get various expressions:
njihG trojica three of them (all male)
vasG obje both of you (all female)
You can also use other quantity adverbs, and quantity adjectives, to quantify
personal pronouns. When you use neki and similar words with pronouns, the rules
change, you have to use od¨ + G:
nitko od nas none of us
jedan od nas one of us
netko od nas somebody of us
neki od nas some of us
mnogi od nas many of us
svatko od nas each of us
nekoliko nas several of us
mnogo nas many of us
dosta nas quite a few of us
puno nas a lot of us
 
svi mi all of us
Of course, you can use the pronoun oni and so on. The rule is: pronoun-like words
require od¨ + G, adverbs just G, while svi behaves like an adjective in such
expressions, and both words change.

69 Memories, Expectations and Fear
There are three areas in Croatian – memory, expectations and fears – which are a bit
different than in English. Each has a twist.
First, these verb pairs are used to express remembering and forgetting:
pamtiti ~~ za- (+ A/CC) memorize, remember
sjećati se² ~~ sjetiti se² (+ G/inf/CC) remember, recall
zaboravljati ~ zaboraviti (+ A/inf/CC) forget
The twist is that Croatian distinguishes storing into memory (zapamtiti) and
retrieving something from memory (sjetiti se²) by means of two perfective verbs (as
you can see from the double tildes, they are not ordinary perf. verbs, but it’s not
important for the moment). However, the two impf. verbs – pamtiti and sjećati se²
– largely overlap in meaning; the latter verb is much more common in speech. In the
meantime, English uses usually just remember:
Zapamtio sam [gdje je autoN]. I remembered [where the car is]. (and now I
know it)
Sjećam se [gdje je autoN]. I recall [where the car is]. (I can get it from my
memory)
The perf. verb sjetiti se² in past tense is often used to express that you have recalled
something just now (and previously you couldn’t):
Sjetila sam se gdje je autoN. I remember now where the car is. (female
speaking)
It’s also very common to use this verb when you remembered (or didn’t) to do
something (expressed in inf), so you did it (or didn’t):
Jesi li se sjetio zatvoriti prozorA? Did you remember to close the window?
If you didn’t remember at some moment, you can also use the verb zaboraviti perf.
forget, it’s not necessarily permanent loss of memory:
Nisam se sjetio zatvoriti prozorA. I didn’t remember to close the window.
Zaboravio sam zatvoriti prozorA. I forgot to close the window.
If you forget something, it’s simply an object in A; but you can also forget about
some event you were supposed to attend, or any other noun that implies your
involvement: then, na¨ + A is used as the object:
Zaboravio sam jaknuA! I forgot my jacket!
Zaboravio sam na utakmicuA! I forgot about the match!
These differences don’t really correspond to English forget vs. forget about. In most
cases, English forget about corresponds to a simple object in A in Croatian.
However, to memorize that you have to do something, you cannot use just inf – a
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 69 Memories, Expecta!ons and Fear
399 / 600

bojati se
bojati se
content clause must be used:
Zapamtio sam [da moram zatvoriti prozorA]. I ‘memorized’ I have to close the
window. (i.e. I know it, I’ll do it, you don’t have to remind me)
The basic verb to express fear in Croatian is:
bojati (boji) se² (+ G/inf/clause)
For example:
AnaN se boji zmijaG. Ana is afraid of snakes.
Another way is using the noun strah + the verb biti (je² +) + one who’s afraid in A (+
what is afraid of in G):
AnuA je strahN zmijaG. Ana is afraid of snakes.
AnuA je bio strahN zmijaG. Ana was afraid of snakes.
AnuA je bilo strahN zmijaG. (the same meaning, more common)
The noun strah fear is the subject, as you can see from the past tense, but the
sentence is usually treated as impersonal, so using neuter singular in the past is
actually more common. As with other expressions where the person who feels
something is not in the nominative case, the person is nevertheless usually placed at
the first position.
The complex biti (je² +) strah behaves like one compound verb. What if you want to
convert it to a verbal noun (i.e. gerund)? You would use then just strah, but what
causes fear is then expressed with od¨ + G:
strah od zmija fear of snakes
strah od letenja fear of flying
There’s one more way, less used in speech, more in writing – the verb pair:
plašiti ~ u- scare
The verbs can be used in both ways:
AnaN se plaši zmijaG. Ana is scared of snakes.
AnuA plaše zmijeN. Snakes scare Ana.
You can also be afraid to do something – then just use the inf of the verb (which can
have its objects and so on):
GoranN se boji voziti biciklA. Goran is afraid to drive bicycle.
AnuA je strahN roniti. Ana is afraid to dive.
On the other hand, there’s just one verb to express expectation:
očekivati (očekuje) expect (+ A/clause)
It’s simple to use – what is expected is in A:
Očekivali smo tvog brataA. We expected your brother.

bojati se
očekivati

bojati se
bojati se | pasti
bojati se | doći
Now, all the constructions described above can be also used with clauses: you can
both be afraid that something might happen or you can expect that something is
going to happen.
All such clauses start with da and in principle can use any tense, e.g. future:
AnaN se boji
Očekujem
da
će biti hladno.
nećemo pobijediti.
The usual rules of word order in clauses apply:
AnaN se boji [da¹ će² biti hladno]. Ana is afraid that it will be cold.
The verb očekivati (očekuje) expect is, of course mostly used to expect future
events.
With both expectations and fear, it’s common – but not obligatory! – to express
future events with the present tense of perf. verbs. It’s the twist: it’s both OK to say:
Očekujem da će pasti kišaN. ‘I expect that rain will fall.’
Očekujem da padne kišaN. (more or less the same meaning)
We have here used the perf. verb pasti (padne, pao) fall. Maybe there’s small
difference in meaning – if you use the present tense of perf. verbs, it’s a bit less
certain, and more speculative.
With the impf. verbs, it’s not possible to use present tense to refer to future events
in such clauses – if you use the present tense, it refers to ongoing processes:
Očekujem da će padati kišaN. ‘I expect that rain will be falling.’ (later)
Očekujem da pada kišaN. ‘I expect that rain is falling.’ (now)
(Of course, this applies to the verb (bude) as well, it behaves as any perf. verb here.)
The same holds for expressing fear, with an important detail – the third twist – if you
use perf. verbs in present to refer to future, possible events, they must be negated:
Bojim se da će pasti kišaN. ‘I’m afraid that rain will fall.’
Bojim se da ne padne kišaN. (more or less the same meaning)
This negation is ‘empty’, it’s just a grammatical feature. (Recall, ‘empty’ negations
also appear with dok + perf. verb; it was introduced back in 54 When, While, Until,
Before, After). If we use a negative-demanding word as e.g. nitko, the sentence
sounds wrong and ungrammatical:
(wrong!) Bojim se da nitkoN ne dođe. "I’m afraid nobody will
come."
That’s because the negation has no effect, it’s an ‘empty’ negation, it carries no
meaning, other words are not negated. The following sentence, however, is
completely acceptable:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 69 Memories, Expecta!ons and Fear
401 / 600

bojati se | doći
bojati se
bojati se
bojati se
bojati se
bojati se
bojati se
bojati se | pasti
Bojim se da netkoN ne dođe. I’m afraid somebody might come.
Of course, the same automatic-but-‘empty’ negation applies to (bude):
Bojim se da ne bude prekasno. I’m afraid it might be too late.
Keep in mind that it’s not mandatory to use (bude), you can use the present or the
future tense of biti (je² +) be as well:
Bojim se da je prekasno. I’m afraid that it’s too late.
Bojim se da će biti prekasno. I’m afraid that it will be too late.
Consequently, this means if you are afraid that something might not happen, you
will have to use the future tense, where negation, if used, really has a meaning:
Bojim se da neće biti mjestaG. I’m afraid there will/might be no room.
For impf. verbs, if there’s a negation, it usually means that you are afraid of
something not happening:
Bojim se da nemam vremenaG. I’m afraid that I have no time.
However, you will see sometimes ‘empty’ negations even with impf. verbs – you
have to apply your common sense then.
Since verbs behave so specially in clauses starting with da after verbs of fear, they
are sometimes called fear clauses.
If someone is afraid something could happen to him or her, regardless of him or her
being the subject of that ‘event’, you cannot use verbs in inf, you have to use a
clause, but of course you can use either the future tense or the present tense (and if
you use a perf. verb, you have to apply the ‘empty’ negation):
Bojim se da ću pasti. I’m afraid I’m going to fall.
Bojim se da ne padnem. (the same meaning)
There’s one more common verb that uses fear clauses:
brinuti (brine) (se²) care (o DL); worry (+ clause)
This verb has more uses and meanings, e.g. care and so on, but with clauses, it
means worry. (According to the Standard, it should have an obligatory se², but it’s
often dropped in a colloquial context.) For example:
Brinem se da ne zakasnim na posaoA. I worry that I’ll be late to work.
Brinem se da ću zakasniti na posaoA. (about the same meaning)
The ‘empty’ negation is completely automatic, most speakers are not aware of it at
all (check the Examples). Many languages have the same feature; if you know some
French, you can see how similar it is (but the negation is not mandatory in French):

(French) Je crains qu’il ne se perde.
Bojim se da se ne izgubi.
I’m afraid he might get lost.
As you can see, there are more similarities – French here uses the se, like Croatian,
since the verb izgubiti («) perf. lose means lose something – but when you add se², it
means get, become lost – and the same applies to French perdre. However, there is
a major difference: the ‘empty’ negation in Croatian fear clauses is used only with
perfective verbs in the present tense.
What about fear clauses and perf-like verbs, i.e. čuti (čuje) hear, razumjeti
(razumije,...) understand and vidjeti (vidi,...) see? First, they are not frequently used
in fear clauses. When they are used, and the present tense is used to refer to the
future, there’s usually an ‘empty’ negation:
Bojim se da ne vidim nešto strašnoA. I’m afraid I might see something
terrible.
However, when they refer to the present, the negation is not ‘empty’; here, the
speaker is afraid that there’s a problem with his or her eyes, or something similar:
Bojim se da ne vidim dobro. I’m afraid I don’t see well.
You will have to use your common sense to understand such (rare) sentences. It’s
best to use the future tense to refer to the future if you have to use such verbs in
fear clauses.
• Something Possibly Interesting
The ‘empty’ negation with verbs of fear is very common; it appears in Japanese,
Korean, Greek, Hindi, etc.
• Examples
This pop/rock song – Tremolo by Vatra – featuring Damir Urban as a guest vocal –
contains several time, content and fear clauses:
Kad rasplače
When a bow
  gudaloN žiceA,
  makes strings cry,
TremoloN u meniDL
Tremolo in me

These two verses contain a time clause; they have two perfective verbs: polomiti («)
shatter as the main verb, and rasplakati (rasplače) make cry in the time clause.

These verses contain a fear clause, with a perf. verb in the present tense, and you
see the negation. By the way, most words after dio are in the genitive case. More
fear clauses follow:
Bojim se [da...]
I’m afraid [that...]
  [da nasDL ne razdvoje

Bojim se [da
I’m afraid [that

(I. Dečak)
Both verses use perfective verbs in present tense in fear clauses, and you again see
the obligatory-but-meaningless negation!
You can listen to it on YouTube™ (Damir Urban is the less conventionally dressed
guy).
(As you can hear, they use the Standard stress quite consistently; Vatra comes from
Virovitica, in Slavonia, where the Standard stress is used in colloquial speech as
well.)
There’s a translation of this song available on the Internet, where fear clauses are
translated verbatim, that is, including negation! Look it up: just enter "I'm afraid we
don't become" into Google™, quotation marks and all. You see, there’s a lot of
hidden grammar people even native speakers don’t think about.

70 If I Were: Conditional Sentences
There’s usually a whole theory in textbooks about various types of so-called
conditional sentences – sentences like if I..., I’d... (add your ideas here).
Actually, it’s quite simple. There are two types of such sentences: the first one is
what could be (or could had been) but it’s not (e.g. if I were rich, I’d...). So it’s a kind
of missed opportunity, a wish that’s not fulfilled, and you say why.
In such sentences in Croatian, what was not, but could have been, is expressed in
conditional, and the reason (or obstacle) is expressed simply in the past tense or the
present tense, starting with the magic word da. Such clauses behave like normal
clauses, perf. verbs cannot be used in the present tense. They simply refer to
imagined actions or conditions that were necessary for the other part (in conditional)
to happen. For example:
Da je bilo toplo, otišli bismo na plažuA. If it had been warm, we
would have gone to the beach. (past)
Da je toplo, otišli bismo na plažuA. If it were warm, we would go to
the beach. (present)
The Croatian sentences are simpler than English, since there’s no special usage of
tenses. If some obstacle holds now, it’s expressed in the present tense. If it
happened in the past, the obstacle is in the past tense. The other part is in
conditional.
There’s an exception to this pattern: if you express what could have happened with
the verb moći (...) can + another verb in infinitive, you should use just the past tense
instead of the conditional; it works for the past only:
Da je bilo toplo, mogli smo otići na plažuA. If it had been warm, we
could have gone to the beach. (past)
English has also mixed conditional sentences, where the condition and unrealized
outcome are in different tenses, e.g. if we had won the lottery, we would be rich.
Since Croatian unrealized outcomes are in the conditional form, which doesn’t show
tense, Croatian sentences really don’t tell when the outcome could have happened.
You can express a different moment with adverbs of time, e.g. the present moment
with sad(a) now:
Da smo osvojili lutrijuA, sad bismo bili bogatiN. If we had won the lottery, we would
be rich. (past-present)
Another way to express ‘present’ (rather, present-indefinite future) unrealized
outcomes is with kad(a). Now both parts are in conditional:
Kad bih imao puno novacaG, kupio bih dobar autoA. If I had a lot of money, I’d
buy a good car. (present)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 70 If I Were: Condi!onal Sentences
405 / 600

ići
1
3f | nazvati
Finally, recall that in colloquial speech and writing, conditional is usually expressed
with just bi² for all persons: you will mostly hear sad bi bili bogati instead of the
formal sentence above, and so on (try Google™).
That much about such sentences.
The second type of conditional sentences is completely different. Now we simply
say what is going to happen if something gets fulfilled.
In English, such sentences look like if I get rich, I’ll... (add more ideas). They are
similar to the first type since both use the word if. Not so in Croatian: first, another
word is used – ako:
Ako je toplo, idemo na plažuA. If it’s warm, we go to the beach. (now, near
future)
Ako bude toplo, ići ćemo na plažuA. If it’s warm, we’ll go to the beach. (future)
As you see, the structure is completely different now: the action is expressed in the
present or future tense, and the part after ako uses the same rules as near future or
future sentences that use kad: bude instead of usual forms of the verb biti, the
potential future tense (again not strictly respected in speech), etc.:
Ako budemo igrali loše, sigurno ćemo izgubiti. If we play poorly, we’ll lose for sure.
(future)
Actually, if you search the Internet, ako ćemo... is more common than ako
budemo... (or ako budem vs. ako ću, etc.). Try it yourself. Still, use of the common
future tense after ako and kad is considered a mistake in formal writing.
In literature, you will sometimes find that in such clauses, instead of ako + forms of
(bude), verb fronting + li² is used:
Bude li toplo, ići ćemo na plažuA.
Budemo li igrali loše, sigurno ćemo izgubiti.
This is extremely rare in speech. There’s no difference in meaning; it’s mostly used
when the verb (bude) is used.
Of course, the conjunction ako holds the first position in the clause, and all second-
position words come right after it.
As you can see, ako-clauses are very similar to kad-clauses, but there’s more
freedom in ako-clauses: since the condition (if it’s warm) and the action (we’ll go to
the beach) are not necessarily close in time, the condition can be expressed in the
past tense, and the action in any tense:
Ako se vratila, nazvat će meA. If she has come back, she’ll call me. (past, future)
Of course, it’s possible to use imperative or even conditional in the main (action)
part – everything, except the past tense:
Ako se vratila, odmah jeA nazovi. If she has come back, call her

immediately. (past, imperative)
There’s another type of sentences, not frequently discussed, kind of opposite of
what I have just described. The reasons in the conditional sentences were important
– they are precisely why something was not done or isn’t done. However, it’s easy to
turn such sentences upside down: something happened (or didn’t) regardless of a
condition. This is what I mean:
Even if it had been cold, we would have gone to the beach.
It wasn’t cold, but even if it were, the second part would happen, regardless of the
condition. In Croatian, surprisingly, you just add an i¨ before da and the whole
sentence changes its meaning completely:
I da je bilo hladno, otišli bismo na plažuA. Even if it had been cold,
we would have gone to the beach.
As usual, the word i¨ is ‘glued’ and it’s not counted: all second-position words come
after the da.
Adding another word – čak – before i da further emphasizes irrelevance of the
condition. Such expression really translates as even if; only i da is more it doesn’t
matter:
Čak i da je bilo hladno, otišli bismo na plažuA. (emphasis)
Another option is that it was cold, but we still did it. The grammar is then of the
second type (ako....). Then you would add i¨ to ako, but then they get fused to a
single word iako:
Iako je bilo hladno, otišli smo na plažuA. Although it was cold, we
went to the beach.
The combined word iako is used like i da – only in the past and present tenses. To
express that you will do something in the future, regardless of something else, use
separate i ako:
I ako bude hladno, otići ćemo na plažuA. Even if it’s cold, we’ll go to the beach.
Finally, it’s possible to ask hypothetical questions, e.g. what would..., if.... Everything
said before about the first type of sentences (using da) still applies:
Gdje bismo išli, da je bilo toplo? Where would we have gone, if it had
been warm? (past)
Što bi radio, da pada kišaN? What would you do, if it were raining? (present)
Of course, it’s possible to ask about future, using ako:
Hoćeš li jeA nazvati, ako se vrati? Will you call her, if she comes back?

This rock song, Samo za taj osjećaj Only for that feeling, performed by Hladno pivo,
contains unrealized conditional sentences (together with purpose clauses):
Da sam prazan listN
If I were an empty sheet
  potpuno čistN
  completely blank
Koristio bih punoA,
I’d use a much,
  puno deblji kistA
  much thicker brush
I samo jarkeA
And only vivid
  i šarene bojeA
  and bright colors
[Da napišem imeA
To write the name
  tvojeA i mojeA]
  yours and mine
(Mile Kekin)
I’ve enclosed the purpose clause in square brackets; it uses the same conjunction
(da) as the first part of the conditional clause, but it comes after everything else.
The song contains more similar verses:
Da se mogu ko nekad
If I could, like long ago,
  vratiti na početakA
  return to the start
I biti onaj istiN
And be the same
  bahati dječakN
  arrogant boy
Ne bih forsiro
I wouldn't insist on
  neki ležeran stilA
  a relaxed style
(Mile Kekin)
The form forsiro is the masc. past form of the verb forsirati («) insist, force with the
ending -ao colloquially shorted. The word ko is shortened kao.
Pay attention where the particle se² – accompanying the verb vratiti return – is
placed:
Da se mogu ko nekad vratiti na početakA...
With a verb + another verb in infinitive, as here, another option would be right after
the infinitive.

(Note that Mile Kekin, the singer of Hladno pivo, stresses words mostly on the
standard place of stress, e.g. koristio, napišem).

71 Suggestions, Permissions and More Verbs
This explains how to say let me go there and similar things.
Common verbs used are:
davati (daje) ~ dati give (+ DL)
dopuštati («) ~ dopustiti («) allow (+ DL)
predlagati (predlaže) ~ predložiti («) propose, suggest (+ DL) 
savjetovati (savjetuje) advise, suggest (+ DL)
zabranj ivati (-uje «) ~ zabraniti («) forbid (+ DL)
These verbs are used with da-clauses which contains verbs in the present tense. As
in other such atemporal clauses, both impf. and perf. verbs can be used. All of them
have a ‘recipient’ in DL – the person who will/should/may do something.
All such verbs are very similar to give in Croatian – you suggest/allow/etc.
something (the whole thing after the da) to someone (who is in the DL case, as the
recipient). English uses another construction here (that + subjunctive) – unlike wait.
Croatian uses the same grammar over and over:
Savjetovao sam AniDL da ode ranije. I suggested (that) Ana leave earlier.
The next two verbs are about giving orders, not in a restaurant, or ordering stuff
over Internet, but as a boss to your subordinates:
naređivati (-uje «) ~ narediti («) order (+ DL)
zapovjeđivati (-uje «) ~ zapovijediti («) order (+ DL)
They use the same grammar as other verbs.
There’s, however, a group of verbs with similar meanings, but they use A instead of
the DL case:
nagovarati («) ~ nagovoriti («) talk into (+ A)
tjerati ~ na- force (+ A)
Now, there are several constructions in Croatian – often a bit colloquial – where the
verb dati perf. give has a special role. In these constructions, the verb is used in the
present tense as well, meaning true present (i.e. right now, ongoing) despite being a
perf. verb.
First, in speech, but also in writing, it’s very common to express that someone
doesn’t allow someone else to do something by the negative present of dati perf.
give:
AnaN ne da GoranuDL da jede sladoledA. Ana doesn’t let Goran eat ice-cream.
(lit. ‘Ana doesn’t give Goran to eat...’)
The first da is a form of the verb dati; the second one is a conjunction. They are
usually not distinguished in writing. However, since the vowel in da from dati is long,
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 71 Sugges!ons, Permissions and More Verbs
409 / 600

3m/n | jesti
pasti
moći pres-3pl
moći pres-3
while the conjunction has a short vowel, the verbal form is occasionally
distinguished by writing a circumflex sign over the vowel: dâ (or, even rarer, a
macron: dā).
It’s also quite common to use this construction in imperative:
Ne daj muDL da jede sladoledA. Don’t let him eat ice-cream. (lit. ‘Don’t
give him to eat...’)
If you aren’t preventing somebody doing something, but you want to prevent
something to happen (where someone can be the subject, but not in control of the
action, e.g. falling), you use it without the DL:
Ne daj da čaša padne. Don’t let the glass fall.
Then, the verb dati used in some mediopassive constructions. I’ve already explained
the most common uses of mediopassive (in 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²). It’s
also common to use more complex sentences in mediopassive. For example, a door
or window can (or cannot) be opened (you see, it’s also passive in English). In
Croatian it’s quite simple:
VrataN se ne mogu otvoriti. The door cannot be opened.
ProzorN se može otvoriti. The window can be opened.
As you can see, and I hope expect, nouns vrata n pl. door and prozor window are
subjects here. The particle se² makes the while sentence passive, i.e. it’s about what
can be done to the door or window.
These sentences have something in common with the permissions above. If
something cannot be done, colloquially, the verb dati perf. give can be used instead
of moći (...) can:
VrataN se ne daju otvoriti. (colloq.) The door cannot be opened.
ProzorN se ne da otvoriti. (colloq.) The window cannot be opened.
The last sentence literally says ‘the door isn’t being given to open’, but the real
meaning is cannot + passive. Again you see that vrata and prozor are subjects: the
verb dati is in pres-3pl in the first sentence, and in singular pres-3 in the second one.
You will sometimes hear such sentences without negation, i.e. with meaning can,
that’ even more colloquial (any maybe restricted to some areas?):
VrataN se daju otvoriti. (colloq.) The door can be opened.
There’s yet another unexpected phrase using the verb dati perf. give, and it’s
superficially similar to ne da... da:
negation + dati° se² + DL + inf = DL can’t be bothered to inf ®
The meaning of this construction – we could call it ‘the lazy construction’ – is very
similar to mediopassive + DL, i.e. ne jede mi se pizza I don’t feel like eating pizza,
but the phrase with dati is normally used when someone avoids duties, chores, any

activity found hard or boring. For example:
AniDL se ne da prati suđeA navečer. Ana can’t be bothered to wash dishes in the
evening.
The translation uses a phrase more common in British English, but I hope everyone
gets the meaning: she cannot force/make/allow herself to do it. This is mostly used
in the spoken language, the construction is a bit colloquial.
This construction is never used with activities generally considered pleasing (eating
chocolate, drinking fine drinks, sleeping) – it’s rather used for waiting in lines,
spending time in waiting rooms, cleaning, studying and so on. The verb used is
imperfective, as we’re focusing on the activity, and not an outcome.
The verb dati perf. give is impersonal here, so it’s neuter singular in the past (the
infinitive + an object, prati suđe, can be considered the subject):
AniDL se nije dalo prati suđeA. Ana couldn’t be bothered to wash dishes.
As you can see, the usual rules about placement of DL experiencers hold – the
person in DL is at the front. Of course, personal pronouns are frequently used:
Ne da miDL se čekati satimaI. I can’t be bothered to wait for hours.
This construction is sometimes used without negation; it then roughly corresponds
to make oneself (but it implies a bit less pressure):
Jel tiDL se da čekati u reduDL? (colloq.) Can you make yourself wait in line?
Finally, let’s introduce another important verb family, derived from the pair:
puštati ~ pustiti release, let go
All derived pairs look the one we have already seen above:
dopuštati («) ~ dopustiti («) allow
All derived pairs have meanings related to releasing (except for one). The common
ones are:

The most straightforward verb pair is derived with o-. It means relax, but only body,
someone’s behavior or a body part; an object in A is mandatory, so you’ll often need
a se²:
AnaN se opušta. Ana is relaxing.
If you are relaxing something else (grip on something, belt, laws...) you have to use
another verb.
The na- pair means abandon, and is simply used with objects in A:
VlasniciN su napustili kućuA. The owners abandoned the house.
The pro- pair basically means ‘fail to catch something’ - either what was said, or a
bus, or any opportunity:
Propustio si dobar filmA jučer. You missed a good movie yesterday.
The is- pair is mostly used when something is dropped in a sequence, i.e. you
dropped a letter when typing or writing. However, it’s also used to describe emitting
sounds and smells.
The pair derived with s- has a completely unrelated meaning: it means lower:
Spustio sam roleteA. I lowered the blinds. ®
The noun roletaA (window) blind often used in plural, even when it refers to a single
thing, but it can be used in singular too.
________
® The construction ne dati° se² + DL seems to be almost completely unknown in
Serbia. Instead, another verb is used, also impersonally, but not negated: mrziti
hate. In the “Ekavian” pronunciation, standard in Serbia, the verb has the form

mrzeti (mrzi). Besides, the person involved is not in DL, but in A:
AnuA mrzi da naveče pere sudoveA. Ana can’t be bothered to wash dishes in the
evening.
As usual, instead of the infinitive clause, in Serbia da + present is used.
Conversely, the construction mrzeti (mrzi)° + A + da is unknown in Croatia, and even
misunderstood sometimes.
The word roletaA (window) blind is used in a slightly different form roletnaA in Serbia.
• Examples
The song Ne daj Don’t let, performed by Natali Dizdar, a Croatian pop-singer,
frequently uses the perf. verb dati give; it also uses the pair propuštati («) ~
propustiti («) miss, introduced above. I have put all clauses into square brackets
[...]:
Ne daj [da nestanem]
Don’t let [me disappear]
Ne daj [da propustim]
Don’t let [me miss]
[Dok se gase svjetlaN
[While the lights go off
JednoN za drugimI]
One after another]
The first two lines use dati perf. give + da-clause. The third line uses a mediopassive
se². The last line above uses za¨ + I in the meaning following.
The next verses use again this construction twice; the verb potrajati (potraje) is
basically just the perfective version of trajati (traje) last:
Ne daj [da ovaj danN
Don’t let [this day
Potraje predugo]
Last too long]
I ne daj [da se
And don’t let [us
Sutra ne vidimo]
Don’t see each other tomorrow]
The last two lines above uses se² in reciprocal meaning, i.e. each other (this was
introduced back in 25 Plural).
The following verses start with an imperative and a purpose clause, and the last two
verses repeat the same structure:
Reci miDL tiho neštoA
Tell me quietly something
[Da se nasmješim]
[So that I smile]
Drži miDL rukuA
Hold my hand
[Da ne zaboravim]
[So that I don’t forget]

The possession of ruka hand, arm is expressed with a pronoun DL, as usual.

72 Addressing and Vocative Case
Finally, now it’s the time to introduce the last case: the vocative case (just V for
short). This is the last case to be introduced, since it’s the least used case.
It’s mostly used when you’re calling or addressing someone. There are no specific
forms in the plural – vocative is equal to the nominative case in plural. The endings
in singular are:
noun type (N)
V
nouns in -a (≈ fem.)
-a → -o
-ica → -ice
(or: no change)
neuter nouns (≈ in -o, -e) = N
masc. nouns not in -a
add -e (some -u)
fem. not in -a (e.g. noć)
add -i
For people, this case is usually used when you are addressing someone using his or
her name or title, often with imperatives or polite expressions, such as:
Hvala Vam, profesore. Thank you, professor.
Molim Vas, dođite, doktore. Please, come here, doctor.
Izvolite, gospodine. Here you are, mister.
Dobar dan, gospođo. Good afternoon, madam.
With personal names, it's increasingly common to use just nominative instead of
vocative. This holds especially for names ending in -a:
Hvala ti, Ana. Thank you, Ana.
Izvoli, Luka. Here you are, Luka.
The vocative for female names is conserved only in set expressions, e.g. in a
Catholic prayer:
Zdravo, Marijo... Hail Mary,...
There's no change for masculine names not ending in -a (regardless whether they
behave as if ending in -a or not):
Dođi, Kruno. Come here, Kruno.
Dođi, Marko. Come here, Marko.
The ending -e for masculine nouns ending in consonant causes consonant shift k →
č, g → ž, h → š:
čovjek man, human → čovječe
bog god → bože
vrag devil → vraže
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 72 Addressing and Voca!ve Case
415 / 600

If a masc. noun ends in a Croatian-specific consonant, it gets -u in vocative:
kralj king → kralju
muž husband → mužu
prijatelj friend (m) → prijatelju
However, if a masc. noun ends in c, it gets -e, and c changes to č:
princ prince → prinče
For nouns ending in -ica, the vocative case is -ice:
kraljica queen → kraljice
prijateljica friend (f) → prijateljice
This usually applies to few female and male names that end in -ica, like Anica (f) and
Ivica (m):
Hvala ti, Anice. Thank you, Anica.
Izvoli, Ivice. Here you are, Ivica.
The are no special vocative forms for adjectives, except that masculine singular gets
an -i (except, of course, for possessives like moj and so on, which never have an -i).
In Croatian, adjectives normally precede nouns (moj prijatelj) but it's common in
vocatives to invert the order (prijatelju moj), and it's especially common in songs
and poetry in general; you will very often hear:
ljubavi moja o, my love
The vocative case is always used in addressing in letters and mail messages. They
usually have the following formula:
dragi
poštovani
+
gospodine (+ last name)
gospođo (+ last name)
name in V
Words gospodin mister and gospođa madam are often shortened:
gospodin mister = g. / gosp.
gospođa madam = gđa
There's one more word: gospođica miss, sometimes shortened to gđica.
Abbreviations gđa and gđica are declined as nouns, that is V = gđo, A = gđu, etc.
There's no period (.) after gđa and gđica.
For example, a letter could start with one of the following:
Dragi Ivane,...
Poštovana gospođo Jurić,...
Poštovani g. Horvat,...
Poštovana gđo Jurić,...
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 72 Addressing and Voca!ve Case
416 / 600

These three words are formal. They are basically used only when you directly
address someone, either in writing, or in a formal situation; therefore, they are
much less often used than English counterparts. For instance, you will often read in
English language newspapers and books sentences like we talked to Mr. Smith... and
so on. You will never see such use of such formal words in Croatian; people will be
referred to using only their last name or full name; however, if someone holds an
office or position (president, minister...) it will be used.
Since words like gospodin are formal, children never use them. While English
language picture books can be about Mr. Bear, Mr. Tiger and so on, you will never
see it in Croatian: such books will be adapted as Big Bear, My Dear Tiger, etc. Even
when adults talk to children about other adults, they won't usually use words like
gospodin.
Children do use specific words addressing grown-ups outside of their family:
Titles used by children
teta
'madam'
striček (NW, including Zagreb)
barba (coast, except Dubrovnik)
dundo (Dubrovnik)
čiko (A -u) (elsewhere)
striko (A -u) (elsewhere)
'mister'
The words are the same as words for relatives in family, and words vary by region.
Children will usually use the title + first name, e.g. they will call their kindergarten
teacher teta Ana; adults will refer to her in the same way, when talking to their
children.
Most familiar terms of relatives nowadays don't have special vocative forms and
use nominatives:
mama Mom
tata Dad
teta aunt
baka grandmother
The following terms have vocative forms:
otac (oc-) father → oče
majka mother → majko
Finally, it's custom to end a letter or mail message with one of:
S poštovanjem,
Pozdrav,
Lijep pozdrav,
Followed by the full name (and function) of the sender. The line Lijep pozdrav is
getting increasingly common, and colloquially abbreviated as lp or LP.

73 Learning and Renting: Verbs Shifting
There are couple of verbs in Croatian that show a bit bizarre behavior (such
behavior is not limited to Croatian and even to related Slavic languages, though).
First, there are verbs that can have two distinct objects in A at the same time.
Common verbs and verb pairs with that feature are:
pitati ~ u- («) ask
učiti ~ na- («) learn, teach
In all such verbs, two objects are clearly distinguished: one object is a person (or
animal) and another is not. For example:
GoranN je pitao neštoA AnuA. Goran asked Ana something.
In this sentence, both Ana and nešto something are in A, but one object is "who",
and another "what", so there’s no ambiguity.
Another example:
AnaN je učila GoranaA plivati. Ana taught Goran to swim.
Here, instead of the second object ("what"), we have a verb in inf, so it’s clear what
is taught.
Now, you’re probably scratching your head: doesn’t učiti mean learn, study? Yes, it
does. It has both meanings.
When the verb pair učiti ~ na- («) is used with a single object in A, which is a thing
("what"), it means learn, study. However, when its object is a person (or animal),
then it means teach, and then another object in A ("what") can be used to express
what is taught. (The second object is not mandatory). The "what" object in both
"configurations" can be a verb in inf. Compare:
AnaN uči GoranaA plivati. Ana is teaching Goran to swim.
GoranN uči plivati. Goran is learning to swim.
Therefore, whenever this verb pair gets an object that’s a person (or animal), its
meaning shifts!
But what if someone is a teacher, and we want to say e.g. Ivan teaches math? One
solution is to express a person-object with some generic word, to shift the verb
meaning. For instance, you can hear:
IvanN uči djecuA matematikuA. Ivan teaches math to children.
(Beware, here the Croatian noun djecu is in A, while English has to, often
corresponding to the Croatian DL case.)
We cannot say just Ivan uči matematiku, since it has exactly the opposite meaning,
however, we can in principle say (but this sounds quite incomplete to me):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 73 Learning and Ren!ng: Verbs Shi_ing
418 / 600

3pl
1pl G
3pl
IvanN uči djecuA. Ivan teaches children.
Another way is to use a more formal verb pair:
predavati (predaje) ~ predati teach, give lecture
So we can say:
IvanN predaje matematikuA. Ivan teaches math.
There are more verbs that have two opposite meanings, depending on other words
around them. Common ones are:
iznajmlj ivati (-uje «) ~ iznajmiti («) rent
posuđivati (-uje «) ~ posuditi («) borrow/lend ®
Both verb pairs have two meanings, depending on the cases used. What is
rented/borrowed/lent is always in A. If you add a person (or animal, but also an
institution, and so on) in DL, it denotes someone receiving:
Posudio sam kišobranA AniDL. I’ve lent the umbrella to Ana.
Iznajmili smo imDL kućuA. We’ve rented (out) the house to them.
However, if you instead of DL use od¨ + G, the meaning shifts, and G represents the
source (i.e. the owner):
AnaN je posudila kišobranA od meneG. Ana borrowed the umbrella from me.
Iznajmili su kućuA od nasG. They’ve rented the house from us.
It’s interesting that English rent shows the same double meaning. If you use the
verbs without DL or od¨ + G, the meaning is ambiguous, and depends on the context.
(There's a suggestion to use another verb pair in the formal Croatian – unajmlj ivati
(-uje «) ~ unajmiti («) – for the meaning rent something from someone, but virtually
nobody uses it.)
The Croatian verb pairs for rent and borrow/lend are ‘round-trip’ verbs, that is, they
imply that the state of things will be restored after some time. Therefore, they are
used with ‘round-trip periods’, that is, preposition na¨ + A:
Iznajmili smo imDL kućuA na dva tjedna24. We’ve rented (out) the house to
them for two weeks.
Unlike the verbs above, which shift their meaning according to cases used, there are
some verbs that use cases in two distinct ways – but there’s not much difference in
meaning. Common ones are:
čuditi wonder, be surprised, marvel
radovati (raduje) look forward to
veseliti (very similar meaning)
They are usually used in a way that what causes emotions is in DL, the person
affected is the subject (in N), and a se² must be used:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 73 Learning and Ren!ng: Verbs Shi_ing
419 / 600

1
1 | 3f
Radujem se odmoruDL. I’m looking forward to the vacation.
But these verbs can be used in the 'inverse' as well, where the person affected is in
A, and what causes emotion is the subject (there’s no se² now):
Raduje meA odmorN. (the same meaning, less frequent)
This way of using the verb čuditi is often considered non-standard in Croatian;
however, it’s very common, especially when the subject – what makes you wonder –
is a content clause:
Čudi meA [da jeA nema]. I am surprised [she’s not here].
Check the Google™ results on the .hr domain:

  hits
"čudi me da"
46800
"čudim se da"
28900
When translated to English, čuditi corresponds to several English verbs:
čuditi se² (+ DL) wonder, marvel (at DL)
čuditi (+ A) amaze, surprise
Finally, there are two common verbs where the affected person is in either DL or
(non-standard) in A. They are:
lagati (laže) lie (tell lies)
smetati be nuisance, disturb, annoy
For example, this is both common and standard in Croatian:
KamenčićN smeta AniDL. A pebble annoys Ana.
But you will occasionally see A used instead of DL with these two verbs.

74 It Just Happened to Me
Croatian has an interesting way of expressing that something happened, you were
involved, but you weren’t in control, it just happened – to you.
As you can probably guess, it involves the DL case, which usually corresponds to
English to + person / personal pronoun:
ToN miDL se dogodilo. It happened to me.
It’s kind of similar to expressions like hladno mi je, but now subjective feelings are
not important. Consider the following sentence:
ČašaN je pala. The glass fell.
We don’t know why it happened. Just adding a person in DL changes its meaning
subtly:
ČašaN miDL je pala. I dropped the glass (accidentally).
If you know some Spanish, you can notice that’s exactly the same as adding an
"indirect object pronoun" (which, of course, corresponds to the Croatian DL case) to
sentences like these:
(Spanish) Se cayó. It fell.
(Spanish) Se me cayó. I dropped it.
If you look into an English-Croatian dictionary, you will probably find that there’s the
verb pair ispuštati («) ~ ispustiti («) listed having one meaning drop, but that verbs
are not the first choice, especially in speech, when you accidentally drop something!
If you want to stress that somebody dropped something intentionally, another verb
pair is used:
bacati ~ baciti (A) throw, intentionally drop
A similar difference is expressed with two a bit similar verb pairs that both translate
to English as leave:
  ostavljati ~ ostaviti
  + A  
  ostajati ~ ostati (ostane)  + DL  (accidentally!)
The case roles in the second pair are "rotated": what is left is in N, while one who
was affected (that is, the person who left something by accident) is in DL:
JaknaN miDL je ostala u autuDL. I left the jacket in the car (accidentally).
If we would use the first verb pair, it’s not said whether is was intentional or not,
could be either way. Notice how the person affected is now the subject, and what is
left is object:
Ostavio sam jaknuA u autuDL. I left the jacket in the car.

With many verbs, the same verb is used for both meanings: unintentional events are
expressed using the mediopassive (introduced in 64 The Door Opens: Fun with se²)
and the DL case. Nobody caused the event (at least that’s what we want to say), but
the one in DL is somehow involved, or affected. This is a common example:
razbijati (razbija) ~ razbiti (razbije) break
  + A = intentionally
  + se² + DL = accidentally
For example:
Razbio sam čašuA. I broke the glass.
ČašaN miDL se razbila. The glass broke (‘on me’).
The English has a similar thing, but only colloquially: ‘on me’.
Again, in the accidental construction, what is broken is the subject (observe how the
past form is in feminine).
The DL case is a common way to add who’s affected – always a person/animal or a
group – to anything. Consider:
GrijanjeN ne radi. The heating doesn’t work.
The sentence above lacks context: what heating. If it’s not working in your house,
you would add a possessive in English: our heating. It can be also done in Croatian,
but the preferred way in speech is to add DL:
GrijanjeN namDL ne radi. Our heating doesn’t work. (lit. ‘doesn’t work to us’)
Again, if you know some Spanish, this will all be very familiar to you. This usage is so
common that some people call it possessive dative.
The accidental construction is really just the ‘mediopassive’ – that is, using se² to
express that we don’t know or don’t want to say who caused it – with a person in DL
who was somehow "affected" or "involved". This is an elegant way to say that what
has happened was not intention of that person.
As you hopefully remember, there’s another construction that uses the
‘mediopassive’ and the DL case: the "feel-like". However, it’s easy to distinguish
them, since the "feel-like" uses impf. verbs (usually, but not always, related to
fulfilling needs, like drink, eat, sleep, smoke). Taking the "feel-like" to the extreme,
we could say that somebody felt like breaking glasses, but there would be still a
difference:
(1) Razbile su miDL se čašeN. The glasses have broken. (‘on me’)
(2) Razbijale su miDL se čašeN. also: I felt like breaking glasses.
You can see clearly how the sentence #1 uses an perf. verb, while the sentence #2
uses and impf. counterpart. However, the sentence #2 is ambiguous: it could also
mean, depending on the context, that glasses were breaking (e.g. you worked in a

422 / 600

2
2pl
1
bar, and glasses were constantly breaking, but it was not your fault, the dishwasher
did it, etc.) This is really an extreme, stretched example, which would be very rare in
real life.
Since persons/animals or groups added in DL are just affected by the event, this use
of DL is also called dative of interest. Its use extends – mostly colloquially – to
sentences where we want somebody to get interested, or when we just emphasize
who is/should be interested. So, in colloquial communication, among friends, it’s
common to add the DL ti² to many sentences when you say something about
yourself or someone else, similar to colloquial English you know:
JaN tiDL sutra ne radim. I don’t work tomorrow. (you know)
Of course, if you’re talking to a group, you would use another pronoun:
JaN vamDL sutra ne radim.
On the other side, when you ask a question, the DL mi² is sometimes added to
emphasize that you’re interested:
Kako si miDL? How are you doing? (I’d like to know)
All these DL’s to express interest are used only colloquially, among close friends and
family.
Another way used in colloquial communication is literally the same as in English,
adding znaš you know to the beginning:
Znaš, sutra ne radim. You know, I don’t work tomorrow.
(the rest is coming soon...)

75 Friends and Family
The following nouns for people are frequently used with possessive adjectives. For
each term, there’s a male and a female version:
male
female
neighbor
susjed ®
susjeda ®
godfather/godmother
kum
kuma
acquaintance
poznanik
poznanica
boss
šef
šefica
coworker
kolega
kolegica ®
The word kolega is similar to tata: the word ends on -a, changes like any other word
on -a, but has masculine gender!
For women, you must use female versions of such nouns. For example:
IvanN je tvoj susjedN. Ivan is your neighbor.
AnaN je moja susjedaN. Ana is my neighbor.
Terms kum and kuma stand for family friends who are traditionally witnesses at
marriage, child baptism, etc.
Croatian has many words for family members. For instance, where English has only
uncle, Croatian has three words: stric, tetak (tetk-) and ujak! I will introduce only
main family members and relatives here. Terms in square brackets [] are formal
terms, not used among family members, only when you are talking to someone
outside family, in writing, etc. Basic terms for parents and grandparents are:
mama [majka] Mom/mother
tata [otac (oc-)] Dad/father
baka Grandma/grandmother
deda [djed] Grandpa/grandfather
In some regions, there are other words for relatives (see below).
Here are terms for father’s and mother’s sisters and brothers (various kinds of aunts
and uncles) and their spouses:
teta mother’s or father’s sister
  tetak (tetk-) husband of teta ®
stric father’s brother ®
  strina wife of stric
ujak mother’s brother ®
  ujna wife of ujak
Colloquially, teta has more meanings: children will call any older, non-related
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 75 Friends and Family
424 / 600

woman teta, e.g. their kindergarten teacher.
If you have children (and possibly grandchildren), they are called:
sin son
unuk grandson
kći
kćerka  
   daughter
unuka granddaughter
For example (the second sentence is less precise in English!):
AnaN je Goranova mamaN. Ana is Goran’s Mom.
ČekamoN Ivanovog stricaA. We’re waiting for Ivan’s uncle.
The noun kći daughter is a special noun, having the following weird forms:
N
A
DL
kći / kćer
kćer
kćeri
The form kćer in N is not Standard, but is frequently used in colloquial
communication®. All other forms are derived from kćer- and follow the pattern for
feminine nouns not ending in a.
In colloquial communication, you will hear ćer, ći and in some regions the
alternative, word kćerka (non-standard, but completely regular) prevails.®
If you want to talk about great-grandfather or great-granddaughter, and so on, add
pra- to the front of words above (e.g. pradjed grandfather, praunuka
granddaughter, etc.).
If you are married, there are names for your husband or wife and her or his parents:
žena [supruga] wife
  punica her mother ® — tast / punac (punc-) her father
muž [suprug] husband
  svekrva his mother — svekar (svekr-) his father
Terms suprug and supruga are very formal, mostly used in official documents.
Croatian uses the same word (žena) for both woman and wife in virtually all
circumstances.
If your children are married, their spouses are as follows:
zet daughter’s husband
snaha son’s wife ®
(There are no established terms for same-sex couples yet.)
There are couple of often used additional terms for various relatives:
nećak brother’s or sister’s son (nephew)
nećakinja brother’s or sister’s daugher (niece)
bratić male cousin
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 75 Friends and Family
425 / 600

sestrična female cousin
šogor sister’s husband / brother of the spouse (brother-in-law)
šogorica brother’s wife / sister of the spouse (sister-in-law)
Besides these terms, there are other, archaic terms used in some regions, which are
much more precise. They are seldom used nowadays in Croatia.
Additionally, there are two group and two generic terms:
obitelj f (close) family
rodbina wider family, all relatives
rođak male relative of any kind
rođakinja female relative of any kind
Take care that obitelj is a feminine noun ending in a consonant. For instance:
Antina obiteljN živi u SplituDL. Ante’s family lives in Split.
There’s a lot of regional variations in terms for family members, especially males.
These are just some alternative terms (with region in brackets):
ćaća m Dad (coast, except Dubrovnik)
barba m any uncle (coast, except Dubrovnik)
dundo (dund-) m any uncle (Dubrovnik)
čiko (A -u) m any uncle (Slavonia)
nono (non-) m Grandpa (coast)
nona Grandma (coast)
familija family (many regions)
In many regions – including Zagreb – there’s no distinction between three uncles –
stric, tetak (tetk-) and ujak – and the local term for uncle is frequently used by
children to address any non-related adult male.
________
® Instead of susjed and susjeda, words komšija m and komšinica prevail in Serbia
and Bosnia, both are also heard in Slavonia, a region of Croatia.
Instead of kolegica, koleginica is used in Serbia and parts of Bosnia.
Instead of tetak (tetk-), the word teča m is used in Serbia (but not in Bosnia).
In Bosnia, the word daidža m is frequently used for mother’s brother, while amidža
m is father’s brother.
Instead of punica, the word tašta is used in Serbia and most of Bosnia.
Forms kćer and kćerka are accepted as standard in Bosnia and Serbia. In addition to
snaha, forms snaja and snajka are frequent in Serbia, Bosnia, and some parts of
Croatia.

• Something Possibly Interesting
If you’re interested in precise terms for brothers- and sisters-in-law, here they are.
Assuming you’re a married woman, you call your husband’s relatives:
djever his brother
  jetrva his brother’s wife
zaova his sister
  zaovac his sister’s husband
If you’re a married man, you call your wife’s relatives:
šurjak her brother
  šurjakinja her brother’s wife
svastika her sister
  svak / pašanac / pašenog / badžo her sister’s husband
These a bit weird terms are so rare in Croatia today that I had to look up their
definitions on the internet. They are still widely used in Bosnia and Serbia, though.
Some of them, like djever, have barely changed for thousands of years.
The system of naming relatives described above is a variant of the so-called
Sudanese kinship.

76 Inner, Outer, Step by Step: More on Space and Time
Here are two spatial adverbs that distinguish locations from directions, with
associated prepositions:
 
dir.
loc.
preposition
outside
van ®
vani ®
izvan outside of
inside
   unutra
unutar within
All prepositions are, as expected, used with G. For example:
HotelN ne radi izvan sezoneG. The hotel doesn’t ‘work’ outside of the (tourist)
season. (= isn’t open)
Sometimes the adverb van can be used with nouns, as a kind of preposition, so
you’ll hear and read both van sezone and izvan sezone.
The following adverbs stand both for origins and locations, in the following way: the
same adverb means from outside and on the outer surface. We can call them
origin/surface adverbs:
izvana from outside, on the outside
iznutra from within, on the inside
odozgo from above, on the top side
odozdo from below, on the bottom side
For example:
Hladan zrakN dolazi izvana. The cold air is coming from the outside. ®
It’s possible to derive relational adjectives from the adverbs above. Such adjectives
are derived by adding -ski, -nji or -šnji. However, since they are far from regular,
they have to be remembered as separate adjectives:
vani out → vanjski outer ®
unutra inside → unutrašnji inner
gore up → gornji upper
dolje down → donji lower
It’s also possible to derive relational adjectives from many specific time adverbs (e.g.
today), as well and you have to use them – there’s no other way say today’s
newspaper in Croatian; they are always derived with -šnji; if the original adverb ends
in -s, it’s lost:
danas today → današnji
noćas tonight → noćašnji
jučer yesterday → jučerašnji
jutros this morning → jutrošnji
večeras this evening → večerašnji
sutra tomorrow → sutrašnji
(The difference večerašnji vs. večernji is the same as večeras vs. večer.)
They are also derived from non-specific time adverbs in the same way:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 76 Inner, Outer, Step by Step: More on Space and Time
428 / 600

sad(a) now → sadašnji
tad(a) then → tadašnji
nekad(a) a time ago → nekadašnji
prije before → prijašnji
English has few adjectives that correspond to Croatian ones: sadašnji translates as
current, present, and nekadašnji as former. For example:
ToN su jučerašnje novineN. This is yesterday’s newspaper.
The adjectives derived from adverbs for last evening and last year do not follow this
scheme:
sinoć last evening → sinoćni (also sinoćnji)
lani last year ® → lanjski
One preposition introduced long ago, normally meaning from with G, has a special
meaning with a specific noun strana side:
s¨/sa¨ ... strane on... the side
For example:
KućeN su s lijeve straneG uliceG. Houses are on the left side of the street.
The same can be expressed with na¨ ... strani, i.e. using a DL expression (which I
personally prefer).
On its own, without any additional words, sa strane usually means aside, apart; in
the same meaning, you can sometimes hear na strani and po strani:
Stajao je sa strane. He was standing aside.
Then, there are couple of interesting prepositions yet unexplained. These two are
quite simple:
niz¨ + A down, along
uz¨ + A up, close to
The basic meaning of them is direction of movement. The preposition niz¨ means
the ‘normal’ direction, i.e. the same direction as the river flows, as hair grows etc.:
Bacila je sveA niz rijekuA. She threw everything down the river.
With steps, ramps, etc. it implies the downward direction:
Trčao sam niz stepeniceA. I ran down the stairs.
The preposition niz¨ is used also with paths that have no obvious direction, like
avenues, river banks, roads, trails, simply to indicate movement along something
which is path-like:
Trčao sam niz ulicuA. I ran down the street.
The preposition uz¨ means the opposite direction from niz¨, but also a location close
to, this has been covered in 55 More Prepositions.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 76 Inner, Outer, Step by Step: More on Space and Time
429 / 600

Finally, there’s a quite complex preposition which is often hard to translate to
English:
po¨ + A by, here and there (‘sequence’)
This preposition is best explained by examples. First, it’s used in expressions like
English step by step, day by day:
Kretao sam se korakA po korakA. I was moving step by step.
Očistio sam sveA, sobuA po sobuA. I’ve cleaned everything, room by room.
Both the word before and the word after po¨ must be in A, so this is definitely not
an usual preposition!
The next use emphasizes there’s more than one instance of something, which
resolves ambiguity in some cases. This example will make it clear:
Dao sam GoranuDL i MarkuDL pedeset kunaG. I gave Goran and Marko 50 kuna.
It’s not clear whether each got 50 kn, or the speaker has given just 50 kn for both of
them. Adding po¨ makes it clear there was more than one 50 kn bill:
Dao sam GoranuDL i MarkuDL po pedeset kunaG. I gave Goran and Marko 50 kuna
each.
Finally, there are adverbs that are historically derived as po¨ + an adverb, but they
are considered single words today. We have already encountered some of them.
Common ones are:
ponegdje here and there
ponekad now and then = sometimes
ponešto this and that thing = a bit, to a degree
The last word is used as a quantity adverb. There are also generic pronouns and
adjectives derived in this way:
poneki (+) occasional, few and far between
ponetko (ponek-) this and that person = a few people
The adjective poneki changes as neki, of course.
________
® Instead of van and the related words, the following words are common in Serbia,
parts of Bosnia and even in some parts of Croatia:
van → napolje
vani → napolju
izvana → spolja
vanjski → spoljašnji
Instead of zrak, the word for air in Serbia and most of Bosnia is vazduh.
The adverb lani has an unexpected “Ekavian” form lane in Serbia, but the relational
adjective is the same.

77 As If: Advanced Clauses
This chapter will wrap up the remaining clauses and clause-like constructions, so it
could be also called various stuff that can be done with da (and sometimes što).
The first thing we’re going to deal with are so-called complex conjunctions. Some
clauses in Croatian can have two forms — one with što, and another with da. For
example:
kao što (+ clause) as
kao da (+ clause) as if
The main difference is that forms with što refer to something that has happened, or
will happen for sure (at least, what is expected to happen), and ones with da to
something that did not happen, or is not expected to happen.
For example:
Vruće je kao što je bilo prošli tjedanA. It’s hot as it was the last week. ®
Vruće je kao da smo u AfriciDL. It’s hot as if we were in Africa.
The first sentence compares the heat to something that really happened, and the
second one to something obviously not true. You can say the second sentence while
in Africa only if you’re joking.
Another situation where we have što vs. da is with comparison conjunction nego,
when used with a clause:
nego što (+ clause) than
nego da (+ clause) than (something imagined)
The combination nego da is only used to compare to something unreal, imagined,
while nego što compares to another, existing action or state:
HotelN je boljiN nego što sam očekivao. The hotel is better than I’ve expected.
Another complex conjunction which shows such duality is umjesto:
(desired event) umjesto što (real event)
(real event) umjesto da (imagined event)
English here uses only instead.
When you look more carefully, the reason and purpose clauses follow a similar
pattern:
zato što (+ clause) because
(zato) da (+ clause) so that
The correspondence is not perfect, for two reasons: first, zato is used in purpose
clauses only for emphasis: only da is normally used. Second, purpose clauses are
restricted to the present tense only.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 77 As If: Advanced Clauses
431 / 600

Then, we have the word osim except ®, used in various complex conjunctions and
similar stuff. They are:
osim ako unless
osim da/što except (see below)
osim...i... besides... also...
These constructions will be explained one by one. We will first tackle osim da and
osim što. They are best understood as osim + clause. Which clause you’re going to
use depends on the main verb.
For example, the expressions moguće je da... it’s possible that..., content clauses
are used (the word moguć possible will be explained in 80 Present Adverbs and
Adjectives). So, for example, you want to say that everything is possible, except that
X. You would then use da, like in a content clause, and just add osim before it:
SveN je mogućeN, osim [da igram protiv BarceloneG]. Everything is possible, except
[‘that I play’ against Barcelona]. = except [me playing against Barcelona]
This is an actual translation of a statement by Andrés Iniesta I found on the Internet.
Pay attention there’s no transformation in the Croatian sentence (from I play to me
playing).
Recall that it’s common to use što to start a content clause when commenting on a
fact:
Dobro je [što pada kišaN]. It’s good [it’s raining].
Next, we want to say it’s nice, except it’s raining:
Lijepo je ovdje, osim [što pada kišaN]. It’s nice here, except [it’s raining].
In such cases, you have to use što.
The complex conjunction osim ako is quite different: it specifies a possible situation
which will prevent the main clause (which is normally in the present tense or the
future, but the meaning is future):
Ići ćemo na plažuA, osim [ako će padati kišaN]. We’ll go to the beach ‘except’ [‘if’ it
rains]. = unless [it rains]
Like in other conditional sentences, use of tenses in much freer in Croatian.
However, there’s often ‘empty’ negation in such clauses, so this is actually more
common:
Ići ćemo na plažuA, osim [ako neće padati kišaN]. (the same meaning!)
Strictly speaking, these are conditional clauses, so the ‘potential’ future should be
used with imperfective verbs, according to standard Croatian:
Ići ćemo na plažuA, osim [ako bude padala kišaN].
Ići ćemo na plažuA, osim [ako ne bude padala kišaN].

masc.
3m/n
3m/n
3m/n | moći past-m
Such standard sentences have the same meaning as a bit colloquial ones with the
common future tense, but they are significantly less common in real life (some 10
times less common on the Internet).
Then, osim... i... is used similar to English besides:
Osim sladoledaG, nudimo i kolačeA. Besides ice-cream, we offer cakes as well.
Here the normal rules of osim + noun are observed (i.e. N, A → G). In writing, it’s
common to use pored... i in this meaning as well.
The next thing is using da-clauses to express how something is done. Such clauses
are then appended to tako so, in such way, so effectively we have tako da:
Odgovorite na pitanjaA tako da zaokružite brojA ispred odgovoraG. Answer the
questions ‘in such a way that’ you circle the number before the answer. (i.e. by
circling a number)
There are two more constructions that use da-clauses. The first one corresponds to
English construction too... to..., for example:
GoranN je premladN [da vozi autoA]. Goran is too young [to drive a car].
While English has too as a separate word, Croatian pre- is glued to the adjective (you
will see it spelled separately from time to time, but it’s non-standard spelling).
While English uses a to-construction, Croatian sentences are of the desire type, i.e.
only present tense (or conditional) but perfective verbs are allowed (one is used in
the example below). Note that the Croatian construction is much more flexible,
since anything can be a subject in the clause, while English is stuck with the infinitive,
which cannot have a subject; therefore, English must use for when the subjects
differ:
SendvičN je prevelikN [da gaA pojedem]. The sandwich is too big [for me] [to
eat (it completely)].
Literally, the Croatian sentence says:
The sandwich is too big da I completely-eat it.
It’t interesting that in such sentences, conditional is used more often than the
present tense; sometimes you’ll see the verb moći (može +, mogao, mogla) can also
added to the clause, with not much difference in meaning:
SendvičN je prevelikN [da bih gaA pojeo].
SendvičN je prevelikN [da bih gaA mogao pojesti].
As with other atemporal clauses, instead of biti (je² +) be, the verb (bude) should be
used, but conditional prevails with that verb almost completely in this construction.
This construction easily translates English phrases like too good to be true i.e.
predobro da bi bilo istina – and similar – but they are not that common in Croatian
and somehow always feel like translation of English phrases.

433 / 600

3f
3pl | moći pres-1
Another construction corresponds to English so... that... While the English
construction looks quite different from the previous one, Croatian simply uses
tako... da..., but the da-clause is of indicative-type (i.e. any tense, but no perfective
verbs in present):
KnjigaN je tako debelaN [da ću jeA čitati danimaI]. The book is so thick [that I’ll
be reading it for days].
Besides tako so, you can use toliko so many (don’t forget it’s a quantity adverb,
therefore, uncountable nouns have to be in G after it, and countable ones in G-pl):
Vidim toliko vrabacaG [da ihA ne mogu izbrojati]. I see so many
sparrows [that I can’t count them].
Sometimes toliko is used with adjectives, so you’ll encounter toliko skupa... da...
and similar expressions:
PizzaN je bila toliko ljutaN [da sam popio litruA vodeG]. The pizza was so hot [that I
drank a liter of water].
(Croatian has one word for both angry and hot because of spices.) Besides these
words, you can see takav (takv-) such, usually before nouns (but it can be used on its
own, since it’s an adjective):
MaglaN je takva [da sviN voze polako]. The fog is ‘such’ [that everyone is driving
slowly].
(The last type, without a noun, must be slightly rephrased in English.)
This type of clause is sometimes called result clause; bear in mind that they require
two things: a word like tako, toliko or takav (takv-) and an indicative da-clause.
In both English and Croatian, there’s also a third type, where the main verb is
negated; in English not... such... to...:
Nisam takav idiotN [da platim 1000 euraG za toA]. I’m not such an idiot [to pay 1000
euros for that].
Now the part after da is not going to happen, so both English and Croatian switch to
an atemporal construction. We again see that Croatian clauses restricted to the
present tense often correspond to English to-constructions. However, the clause in
this construction can be also in the future tense:
Nisam tako glupN [da ću toA kupiti]. I’m not so stupid [that I’m going to buy it].
The last thing could be called the ‘weirdest construction’. It’s a kind of extension of
the negative + nego construction, introduced in 43 And, Or, But: Basic Conjunctions.
Recall:
ToN nije mačkaN, nego pasN. It’s not a cat, it’s a dog. (or: instead, it’s a dog)
You can also say it for verbs:

434 / 600

teći
3f A
OnN ne spava, nego gleda televizijuA. He’s not sleeping, he’s watching TV instead.
The ‘weirdest construction’ is similar, but it says that the first (negated part) is an
understatement. An example in English would be:
I’m not (just) cold, I’m (actually) freezing!
And in Croatian, it looks like this:
Ne da miDL je hladno, nego se smrzavam.
What is ‘weird’ in this construction? First, ne¨ and da are glued into a complex
conjunction (still spelled as two words, of course, but usually pronounced as one
word). You can’t place anything in between. The conjunction (or whatever it is) nego
is optional:
Ne da miDL je hladno, smrzavam se.
The second weird thing is that you can pull things (I mean, words) out from the da
clause:
MeniDL ne da je hladno, nego se smrzavam. (the same meaning, emphasis on the
person who feels it)
Pulling subjects out is quite common (but optional):
VodaN ne da curi, nego teče. Water is not just leaking, it’s flowing.
The understatement in the first part can be also negative:
Ne da nije pročitao knjiguA, nije juA ni otvorio. It’s not just that he didn’t read
the book completely, he didn’t even open it.
The English translation is not so elegant, but it’s a very compact expression in
Croatian.
________
® In most of Bosnia, instead of prošli tjedan last week, prošle nedjelje is used; in
Serbia it’s in the “Ekavian” form prošle nedelje.
In Serbia, besides osim, the word sem is also used, with the exactly same meaning
and grammatical properties.
• Examples
Kao da me nema tu As if I weren’t here is one of pop hits performed by Ivana
Vrdoljak, who performs under the name Vanna (the double n likely just makes it a
bit more foreign and therefore cool).
The title also features a negative existential nema° + me², but also tu in meaning
here, which is very common, but not strictly standard in Croatian. The chorus
contains a number of as if constructions. Note that the Croatian lyrics have
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 77 As If: Advanced Clauses
435 / 600

everything in the present tense, but English have the subjunctive shift to the past:
I kao [da meG nema tu]
And as [if I weren’t here]
  jaN tonem sve do dnaG
  I’m sinking all the way to the bottom
I kao [da miDL nestaje
And as [if
  tloN pod nogamaI]
  the ground under my feet were disappearing]
The second verse has sve do¨, where sve doesn’t mean all, but all the way, i.e. it
strengthens the preposition do¨. The third and fourth verse are one sentence, the
verb is in the third verse, and the pronoun mi² refers to noge feet/legs which is the
subject; the fourth verse also illustrates pod¨ + I. I guess the pronoun ja in the
second verse is there just to add one syllable.
The rest of the chorus has a similar structure, again the DL mi² marks the possession
of tijelo body. (You see again and again how DL is common with body parts.)
I kao [da miDL tijeloN gori]
And as [if my body were burning]
  jaN zovem upomoć
  I’m calling for help
A ponovo bi dala sveA
And I’d give everything again
  za jednu jedinu noćA
  for a single night
(Ante Pecotić)
The word bi is, of course, just the colloquial form of bih, the 1st person of the
conditional verb. The phrase jedan jedini means a single; of course, both words are
adjectives, and change when needed.

You have now some basic knowledge of Croatian, and you are going to enjoy some
popular Croatian tune you discovered on YouTube™. To your surprise, it contains
some strange words and forms.
You look up the lyrics and find words that are not in your pocket dictionary. Then
you look them up in an online dictionary, but it does not help either! What is going
on?
Chances are, you picked up a song that's not in Standard Croatian, but in a dialect –
language particular to some region (this is a bit confusing, since any language is
particular to a region; what is called a ‘language’, and what ‘dialect’ is simply a
matter of convenience; also, dialects are usually not used by governments). There
are many dialects, but there's a big group of them, that have a characteristic i sound,
and are therefore called Ikavian.
Ikavian dialects are usually found on islands and coast, cities Split and Zadar, but
also inland, and in parts of Istria.
Simply said, where Standard Croatian has ije or je, they have i. For example (I've
listed only nominatives and infinitives):
Standard word
Ikavian
dijete child
dite
dvije two (f)
dvi
gdje where
di / gdi
lijep adj. nice, beautiful
lip
mlijeko milk
mliko
nedjelja Sunday
nedilja
vrijeme time/weather
vrime
There's no change for verbs that have -ije in their pers-3 and the -i- comes from the
infinitive, such as:
piti (pije) drink
brijati (brije) shave
Verbs having infinitives in -jeti in Standard Croatian have -i- in all forms and appear
regular in Ikavian; this includes the Ikavian version of razumjeti understand:
razumiti understand  
viditi see
živiti live
etc.
 
  regular verbs

437 / 600

There are a couple of words where just the Standard re is changed to ri:
Standard word
Ikavian
mreža net
mriža
prestati (prestane) perf. stop
pristati (pristane)
rezati (reže) impf. cut
rizati (riže)
sreća happiness, luck
srića
trebati impf. need/should
tribati
usred in the middle of
usrid
jesti eat
jisti
orah walnut
orih
Ikavian pristati stop looks like another verb from the same family, meaning consent,
agree – prefixes pre- and pri- have merged in Ikavian! Of course, this doesn't apply
to every re in every word – these words have to be learned.
There are some words where it isn't re vs ri, as in the two rows in the table above.
Perhaps confusingly, this applies also to the negative present tense of the verb imati
have and to indefinite pronouns/adjectives like neki and nešto:
Standard word
Ikavian
nemaš pres-2 you don't have
nimaš
neki adj. some
niki
nešto something
ništo
Many Ikavian dialects also have specific past-m forms: instead of -o, they have -a
and -ja:
verb
Std. past-m
Ikavian
biti (je² +) be
bio
bija
imati have
imao
ima
vidjeti see
vidio
vidija
When the past-m in Standard Croatian ends in -ao, in such dialects it ends in only -a.
When other vowels are found before the final -a, some people write just -a, other -
ja, so you will see both bia and bija.
Many such dialects are spoken on the Adriatic coast or near it, but not all dialects on
the coast are Ikavian.
Furthermore, most coastal dialects, be Ikavian or not, have another interesting
feature: in verb and case endings, where Standard Croatian has -m, they have -n
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 78 Dijete vs. Dite
438 / 600

instead:
verb
Std. pres-1
coast
biti (je² +) be
sam
san
imati have
imam
iman
For nouns and adjectives (example for the instrumental case):
word
Std. I
coast
žena woman/wife
ženom
ženon
moj my
m, n
mojim
mojin
f
mojom
mojon
This change affects only word-final m's: endings -mo (pres-1pl) or -ma (DLI-pl)
aren't affected.
There's another feature that doesn't completely overlap with the change from -m to
-n: loss of lj. Instead, such dialects have usually just j:
Standard word
coast
people
ljudi m pl.
judi
love
ljubav f
jubav
trouble
nevolja
nevoja
There are some specific constructions used today in Split and the surrounding area.
The most common is:
u¨ + G (Split area) = std. kod¨ + G
Therefore, you often hear and read u nas instead of kod nas for at our place, here
(i.e. German bei uns).
Furthermore, there are a lot of specific words in Dalmatia (this list is by no means
exhaustive, there are many hundreds specific words):
Standard word
Dalmatia
pillow
jastuk
kušin
towel
ručnik
šugaman
clock, hour
sat
ura
plate (to eat from) tanjur
pjat
fork
vilica
pirun
Many of these words also appear in the Northern Adriatic, i.e. in the Rijeka area and
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 78 Dijete vs. Dite
439 / 600

Istria. One of the main differences is that Split area consistently uses the Standard
stress system, with all shifts, etc. while in Rijeka, the 'western' stress prevails.
Use of Ikavian is very widespread in Split and surrounding areas in everyday
communication. A lot of local musicians produce music with Ikavian words. There
are even novels and newspaper columns written in Ikavian. There are movies and
‘telenovelas’ with a lot of Ikavian forms. Since such songs and ‘telenovelas’ are quite
popular in countries of former Yugoslavia, everyone understands a bit of Ikavian,
despite it having no official status anywhere. (There's a small population in Northern
Serbia, called Bunjevci, which is – controversially – sometimes considered a separate
ethnic group in Serbia, and their language is Ikavian. They have primary schools in
Ikavian.)
The difference Ikavian vs. Standard Croatian is similar to e.g. difference between
Standard Serbian and Standard Croatian. However, bear in mind that there are
dialects in Croatia that much more divergent, to the point of being barely
understandable, having specific sounds, case forms, and so on! They will be
described in A8 Dialects.
Finally, Ikavian is far from homogeneous. What is spoken on islands would be very
different than what is spoken inland. Generally, on islands and smaller towns, you'll
see larger difference from the Standard and more specific forms.
There's one more difference that is completely independent of Ikavian, but some
Ikavian dialects, including Dalmatian hinterland, have it: loss of h. It was replaced by
either v or j, depending on the surrounding sounds, or simply lost, e.g. in the
beginning of the word (I have listed only nominatives):
Standard word
h-less
kruh bread
kruv
hladan adj. cold
ladan
snaha son's wife
snaja
suh adj. dry
suv
Today, most people in Split – especially when they speak privately – don't have h in
most words. This produces, with other differences described above, e.g. past forms
tija and tila, corresponding to Standard htio and htjela.
This loss also happened in large parts of Bosnia and whole Serbia (however,
Standard Serbian has restored h at the beginning of words, so it's hladan and suv in
Standard Serbian.)
There are also Ekavian dialects, where all changes are similar to ones described
above, but have e instead of i (lep, etc.). They prevail in Serbia, and the Standard
Serbian in Serbia is Ekavian. You can find more about Ekavian in A9 Bosnian, Serbian
and Montenegrin.

This overview of Ikavian was intentionally brief and light; there are whole books
written about various dialects, mostly dictionaries of local speech for some town or
region. Unfortunately, little is available online.
Please don't think ‘Ikavian’ equals ‘Dalmatian’. For example, Dubrovnik is a city in
Dalmatia, but the dialect spoken there is very different from one spoken in Split, and
by no means Ikavian.
• Examples
There are so many popular Croatian songs in Ikavian, that it's hard to give just a few
examples!
This hit performed by Goran Karan – Lipa si, lipa – is not about a tree (Std. lipa lime
tree, tilia), but about a woman (beautiful, of course).
Za tobomI noćas
For you tonight
  plaču mandolineN
  mandolins cry
Najlipša ružoV
Most beautiful rose
  ikad procvitala
  ever blossomed
LipaN si, lipaN
You're beautiful, beautiful
  anđeli ti sliče
  angels look like you
LipaN si, lipaN
You're beautiful, beautiful
  usne, tvoje liceN
  the lips, your face
Jubi meA, jubi
Kiss me, kiss
  i kad zoraN sviće
  even when a dawn breaks
Sa nebaG pada
From skies fall
  po namaDL cvićeN
  flowers onto us
Dođi u ponoćA
Come at midnight
  prođi kraj fontaneG
  pass by the fountain
Da misecN vidi
So the Moon can see
  tvoje lipe očiA
  your beautiful eyes
(Nenad Ninčević)
You can listen to it on YouTube™.
Another example is U prolazu In passing. It's again a purely Ikavian song:
Pusti, neka vitarN nosi
Let the wind carry
Ove naše zadnje ričiA
These last words of ours
SvitloN sja u tvojoj kosiDL
Light shines in your hair
TvojN meA pogledN i sad liči Your look still heals me
U prolazuDL, u prolazuDL
In passing, in passing
(Jakša Fiamengo)
A bit later, there are verses:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 78 Dijete vs. Dite
441 / 600

projti
f
1pl | f
2
I dok čekan, teku ureN
And while I'm waiting, hours 'flow'
KoN zna čaA i komuDL broje
Who knows what and whom they count
This seems obscure, but 'flowing of hours' is a bell on a clock-tower, 'counting'. The
word ura is a bit archaic version of sat.
However, the word ča what is specific for a group of dialects that are named after it
(called Čakavian or Chakavian in English). They have a number of interesting
features, which are almost completely absent in this song. These dialects were much
used in Croatian Renaissance literature. (You maybe recall that ča is an extremely
archaic form of što, from 28 Asking Who and What).
You can listen to it on YouTube™ – check the performance by Tamara Obrovac,
generally considered outstanding.
A venerated tradition in Dalmatia is klapa – groups singing a capella. They are mostly
men, but they are women groups too.
This song, A vitar puše (the form vitar is obviously Ikavian), contains some
interesting features:
Su pjatomI juveG
With a plate of soup
Kad projdu daniN
When days pass
I stvari lušeN
And fancy things
Ova nasA jubavN
This love
Jača i rani
Strengthens and feeds us
A vitarN puše!
And the wind is blowing!
(Jakša Fiamengo)
You can see here loss of h, e.g. rani instead of hrani.
There's another interesting form: projdu instead of prođu. This is an older form
which is retained in many dialects – in many places – but is today absent from
Dalmatia, except maybe on the islands. In that verse, verb is placed before the
subject, which continues into the next verse, so these verses mean when days and
fancy things pass i.e. when we get old and poor.
This is actually a pop song, performed by Oliver Dragojević, but check the version by
women from Klapa Neverin on YouTube™.
All songs above were modern, late 20th century works, both lyrics and melody. The
next song, Ju te san se zajubija I fell in love with you is a traditional song:
Ju teA san se
With you I've
  zajubija
  fallen in love
DrugeG ne bi
Another one I wouldn't
  poželija
  wish
CesaricaN da bi bila
Even if she were an empress
There's an interesting (and archaic) feature: the verb poželiti perf. wish (Ikavian
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 78 Dijete vs. Dite
442 / 600

3m/n | sresti
f
f
form) uses G (druge) instead of A (drugu) for its object, when negated. (This is not a
classic perf. verb, as you cannot "complete" wish: such verbs will be explained in 81
Sneeze Once and Start Blooming.)
You can check a performance by a big choir, made of merged klapa's on YouTube™.
There's more. In early 21st century, the most influential group from Split – in a
category of its own, kind of mixture of pop, hip-hop and traditional sounds – is The
Beat Fleet, usually shortened to TBF. Any song performed by them is worth listening;
their works touch a wide range of themes, including love, everyday life, drugs, urban
decay, politics.
This is a kind of love song, Fantastična Fantastic (f) – about a friend who becomes a
drug addict and hallucinates having a girlfriend, literally a fantasy:
MaraN nije ima mobitelA
Mara had no cellphone
  nikad nije bia doma
  he was never at home
I onda jednog jutraA
And then one morning
  sam gaA srea isprid liftaG
  I met him in front of the elevator
a MaraN je bia sritanN
and Mara was happy
  ka nikad
  like never (before)
I sta je pričat:
And he started to talk:
  upozna sam
  I've met
  ljubavA svog životaG
  the love of my life
  prije misecA danaG
  a month ago
Kad sam se spustia
When I went down
  do dućanaG
  to the store
Po kruvA i mlikoA
To get bread and milk
  u onoj plastičnoj bociDL
  in that plastic bottle
Na blagajniDL ugleda te očiA
I saw those eyes at the checkout
(Aleksandar Antić)
One form is worth explaining: in parts of Dalmatia, the verb stati (stane) perf. come
to stand also means start, begin.
The language in their songs is how younger people in Split actually speak, there is a
lot of influence from Standard Croatian (here srea instead of Ikavian sria, prije
instead of Ikavian pri, later you can hear tjedan week, a word which is traditionally
not used in Dalmatia, etc.), a lot of local slang, words offensive to some (older
people) etc. Check the live performance on YouTube™.

79 You’re Wrong and Other Phrases
I will explain various phrases with non-obvious meanings.
The first group is about being right or wrong. There are two ways to express it:
right
wrong
biti (je² +) be +
u pravu
u krivu ®
imati have +
pravo
krivo ®
These two sentences have the same meaning:
U pravu si. You’re right.
Imaš pravo. (the same meaning, less common)
Expressing right or wrong with biti (je² +) be is more common.
The word krivo is also used as an adverb, to indicate that some action is not done in
the ‘proper’ way. For example:
Krivo si meA shvatila. You misunderstood me.
However, to express that something is done right, this word is usually used:
ispravno correctly
For example:
Ispravno si meA shvatila. You understood me correctly.
The word pravo can be also a noun, meaning right. It can be used with the verb
imati have and either na¨ + A or another verb in inf, meaning be entitled to, have
right to:
Imaš pravoA na svoje mišljenjeA. You’re entitled to your opinion.
There are adjectives with opposite meanings:
pravi true, right
kriv false, wrong, guilty
lažan (lažn-) false, fake
pogrešan (pogrešn-) wrong
The adjective with the positive meaning covers both something that really is so, and
the right choice:
OnN je pravi prijateljN. He’s a true friend.
OvoN je pravo mjestoN. This is the right spot. (lit. ‘true/right place’)
With three adjectives with negative meanings, kriv covers both meanings wrong
choice and guilty, while lažan (lažn-) is something that looks right, but it isn’t. Finally,
pogrešan (pogrešn-) is again only wrong choice.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 79 You’re Wrong and Other Phrases
444 / 600

With the adjective kriv, there is a common phrase expressing fault and blame. It’s
best explained by examples:
OnN je krivN za toA. That’s his fault.
Za sveA sam ja krivaN. It’s all my fault. (I = female)
It literally means ‘he is guilty for that’. This phrase is often used in negative, clearing
someone of responsibility, often additionally expressing someone’s claim is wrong,
that it’s actually the responsibility of the one who claims! This is expressed simply by
adding the ‘accuser’ in DL:
MiN tiDL nismo kriviN. It’s not our fault (it’s yours).
NitkoN tiDL nije krivN. It’s all your fault. (lit. ‘nobody is guilty to you.’)
The last example is a very often used phrase, which also corresponds to English
you’ve got only yourself to blame.
Then, there’s a verb family derived from the same root as the adjective pravi true,
right, and it has very common meanings. It follows an asymmetric pattern:
praviti ~ na- make
po-pravljati ~ po-praviti (a derived pair)
Common derived pairs in this family are:
-pravljati ~ -praviti
prefix
used with
meaning
is-
A
correct
po-
A
repair, fix, mend
se²
improve
pre-
A
reconstruct, remodel
ras-
(o¨ DL)
discuss
The first pair, derived by is-, is straightforward – you just correct an object in A
(which can also be se² or sebe):
AnaN je ispravila greškeA. Ana corrected errors.
The pair derived by po- is also straightforward – something is broken or wrong, and
you fix it:
IvanN je popravio biciklA. Ivan fixed the bicycle.
You can also fix yourself, i.e. improve. The meaning is actually mediopassive – from
improving on its own to getting improved:
VrijemeN se popravlja. The weather is improving.
The pair derived by pre- is a bit less common. It’s used when you change or
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 79 You’re Wrong and Other Phrases
445 / 600

1
reconfigure something, but it’s not necessary a correction or improvement.
The pair derived by ras- has a completely unexpected meaning: discuss. It’s used in
the same way as razgovarati («) converse:
Raspravljali smo o planovimaDL za ljetoA. We have discussed plans for the summer.
Raspravljao sam s AnomI. I discussed with Ana.
Note that this pair does not use a simple object in A, unlike English!
The perfective verbs have mostly derived verbal nouns of the -ak type:
ispravak (ispravk-) correction
popravak (popravk-) repair
but:
rasprava discussion
Then, there’s the verb ticati (tiče) touch which is mostly used in this phrase:
ticati (tiče) se² + G concern, involve
For example, this is a very frequent sentence:
Ne tiče meA se. It doesn’t concern me. = It’s none of my business.
Let me explain you more phrases. However, to explain them, I need to explain a few
grammar details first.
There are two impersonal constructions we haven’t covered yet: both don’t allow a
subject, but normally have objects. The first one looks like the mediopassive, but
uses A instead of N, so there’s no subject:
KavaN se vrlo brzo skuha. Coffee is (can be) prepared very quickly. (mediopassive) ®
KavuA se vrlo brzo skuha°. One prepares coffee very quickly. (impersonal) ®
What’s the difference? Only cases used, and not much difference in meaning. They
mean basically the same. Of course, they aren’t grammatically the same, the second
one has no subject (no words in N), so the verb must be neuter singular in the past:
KavaN se vrlo brzo skuhala. Coffee was prepared very quickly. (mediopassive)
KavuA se vrlo brzo skuhalo. One prepared coffee very quickly. (impersonal) ®
While the (se² + A) construction is usually called ‘impersonal’, its meaning is really
mediopassive. We can call it se²+A-passive. This construction is actually more
precise, since the first construction can be also sometimes understood as a
reflexive, as in the following example:
pitam se
I ask myself
or: I am asked. ??
???
pita° meA se ®
One asks me.
= I am asked.
no confusion
As you can see, the first construction would rather be understood as a simple
reflexive. So people use the second construction to specify that they are being
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 79 You’re Wrong and Other Phrases
446 / 600

1
f
doći past-n
asked. This phrase is especially frequent (where the stressed form mene is often
used instead of me², to further emphasize the point):
Ako se meneA pita°... If I’m asked... (i.e. if you want to know what I think)
This expression is also common:
Da se meneA pita°, a ne pita° meA se,...
This is rather rhetorical: if anyone asked me – but nobody does... I’d say....
Besides pitati ask, verb pairs commonly using such passive are not really common.
Some of them are:
nazivati («) ~ nazvati (nazove) call, name
prozivati («) ~ prozvati (prozove) call the roll, single out
spominjati ~ spomenuti («) mention
The first pair is used with meaning e.g. she named him Jack.
Three more phrases are simple impersonal phrases with non-trivial meanings. The
first one is:
radi° se o + DL it’s about / it’s
Some people consider this phrase colloquial. The phrase is used usually when we
want to explain what something previously discussed, but not really known, really is.
For example:
ToN nije bio kitN. Radilo se o morskom psuDL. It wasn’t a whale. It was a shark.
(Yes, we use the phrase morski pas – literally sea dog – for the shark.)
As expected, the verb raditi work/do is here in neuter singular in the past. This is yet
another ‘generic’ use of this verb. A very similar expression is:
riječ je o + DL it’s about / it’s
The verb here is usually understood as having riječ f word as its subject, so in the
past it’s bila je riječ.... However, you will sometimes see it impersonal in this
expression as well (there’s a number of expressions in Croatian that have the same
property; they always have some fixed noun as the subject – recall strah me je from
69 Memories, Expectations and Fear).
Another impersonal phrase involves a common verb pair:
dolaziti ~ doći (dođe, došao, došla) + do + G come up, arise, occur
For example:
Došlo je do nesporazumaG. A misunderstanding has arisen.
This sounds quite formal in English, but this is an everyday expression in Croatian. It
also corresponds to come about. Instead of a noun in G, a whole content clause can
be inserted, attached to a to (in G):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 79 You’re Wrong and Other Phrases
447 / 600

doći past-n
Dolazi° do togaG da... It’s getting to the point where...
Došlo je do togaG da... It got to the point where...
Observe how the first sentence uses the impf. verb, corresponding to English
continuous (progressive) action, while the second one uses the perf. verb, since it
has already got to the ‘point’.
(the rest is coming soon)
________
® The expression u krivu is very rare and non-standard in Serbia and Bosnia, but very
common in Croatia.
Instead of kava, a slightly different word kafa is common in most parts of Bosnia
and Serbia. In Bosnia, the form kahva is used as well, especially in parts where
Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) live.
Constructions like pita me se and kavu se kuha are very rare in Serbia. Basically, the
only use of such construction in Serbia is rhetorical ako se mene pita, which is often
condemned by Serbian prescriptivists (i.e. the language police) as ‘corruption of
language’.
• Something Possibly Interesting
It seems that some people in Croatia (likely, depending on the region) prefer the
construction kavu se kuha over kava se kuha – I’ve seen even people “correcting”
the normal se²-passive into the se²-with-A passive! Be prepared.

80 Present Adverbs and Adjectives
How to say flying saucer or playing cards in Croatian? English is here quite simple:
the same form that’s used to make the Present Continuous tense (e.g. I’m flying) is
re-used as an adjective.
Croatian has two special forms. The first one is called present adverb (or present
participle). It’s a very simple form to make, just take the pres-3pl form of the verb
and add -ći to it:
čekati wait → čekajući
ležati (leži) lie, recline → ležeći
jesti (jede) eat → jedući
učiti learn, study → učeći
Since all pres-3pl forms end in either -u or -e, all present adverbs end in -ući or -eći.
This form can be used in various ways. First, it can be used as an adverb, meaning
while x-ing:
Zaspao sam gledajući televizijuA. I fell asleep while watching TV.
Here the verb zaspati (zaspi) is a perfective verb meaning fall asleep. Such verbs will
be described in the next chapter.
The case of any noun appended to the participle is the same as used with the verb:
gledam televizijuA (A) I’m watching TV → gledajući televizijuA
Adverbs are used in this way mostly in formal writing; in speech and casual writing,
time clauses with dok are preferred, so you will hear usually:
Zaspao sam [dok sam gledao televizijuA]. I fell asleep [while I was watching TV].
Furthermore, impf. verbs derived from davati give – which have alternative (and
non-standard) present tense forms – have often adverbs which are derived from the
non-standard form, for example:
prodavati (prodaje) sell →
prodajući
prodavajući
The ratio of the two forms (as given by Google™ on the .hr domain; try it yourself) is
roughly 2:1 in favor of the standard form prodajući. Therefore, expect to see and
hear both forms.
There’s one irregular adverb, common in speech, used like this:
poznavajući + A from what I know about A ®
There are more present adverbs used in phrases. A common one is:
zahvalj ivati (-uje «) thank → zahvaljujući
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 80 Present Adverbs and Adjec!ves
449 / 600

It’s used with DL:
Zahvaljujući dobrom vremenuDL, plažeN su puneN. Thanks to the good weather,
beaches are full.
A lot of present adverbs can be used as adjectives, and that’s quite common in
speech. This is usually possible only for adverbs made from verbs that cannot have
any object, e.g. for the present adverb made from spavati sleep but not for the
adverb made from učiti learn, study. So you can call UFO’s:
Vidjela je leteće tanjureA. She saw flying saucers.
You see how here the present adverb is understood as an adjective and put to the
masc. A-pl form. Some common present adjectives are:
leteći flying
ležeći lying
odgovarajući suitable
postojeći existing
prateći accompanying
trepćući blinking
viseći hanging
vodeći leading
A couple of present adverbs have specific meaning as adjectives (besides the inf,
only pres-3 forms are listed here, since only those forms are important for
formation of present adverbs and adjectives):
verb
present adj.
(bude) perf. be
budući future
ići (ide) go
idući following, next
moći (može +) can
moguć possible
slijediti follow
sljedeći next
teći (teče) flow
tekući flowing, liquid ®
The adjective budući means future in e.g. future tense. The word sljedeći is spelled
so when used as an adjective, but slijedeći if used as an adverb. The adjective
moguć even lost the otherwise obligatory final -i.
Some present adjectives form combinations with specific meanings:
ležeći policajac speed bump (lit. ‘lying policeman’)
tekući račun checking (or current) account (lit. ‘liquid account’)
Don’t forget that they are adjectives, when used to describe a noun, or in set
combinations:

There’s one English construction where -ing forms are used which translate as
neither gerund nor present adverb:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 80 Present Adverbs and Adjec!ves
450 / 600

otići past-f
She saw birds flying.
In Croatian, one way to express this is using kako (usually meaning how) or da with a
small clause (with normal tense rules) after it:
Vidjela je pticeA kako lete.
Vidjela je pticeA da lete.
Another option is to use kad(a) and a clause. Recall this line from the example in 52
Stand, Become, Exist, Cease:
Čulo se samo kako pticeN pjevaju. Only birds singing could be heard.
Here the birds singing is actually the subject of the verb čuti (čuje) hear, used in the
mediopassive construction.
Since present adverbs stand for action performed by the noun after them (tekuća
voda = flowing water = water that flows), they cannot be used for expressions like
bathing costume: the costume doesn’t bathe, it’s just used when someone is bathing.
Therefore, there’s another form, used only as adjective, but looking really similar to
the present adverb (the form has no name, unfortunately). For verbs with infinitive
in -ati, it’s created by transforming that ending to -aći:
kupati bathe → kupaći
spavati sleep → spavaći
šivati sew → šivaći
žvakati (žvače) chew → žvakaći
(Compare them to the present adverbs of these verbs, e.g. kupajući and spavajući.)
If verbs don’t end in -ati, it’s made from their pres-3 form in a way that the result
always ends in -aći:
jesti (jede, jeo) eat → jedaći
These adjectives are used in set expressions only, e.g.:
brijaći aparat electric razor
igraća karta playing card
kupaći kostim bathing costume
kupaće gaće swim briefs
spavaća soba bedroom
šivaća mašina sewing machine
žvakaća guma chewing gum
The adjective kupaći is virtually used only to describe those two nouns, so it’s
colloquially very often used on it’s own, nouns are omitted. When in singular
masculine it’s costume, and in plural neuter it’s briefs. Of course, it still changes as
any adjective:
Otišla je bez kupaćegG. (colloq.) She left without the swimming
costume.
Zaboravio sam kupaćeA. (colloq.) I forgot my swim briefs.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 80 Present Adverbs and Adjec!ves
451 / 600

Here the adjective kupaći is in G, as required by the preposition bez without. We
know it’s a costume, since it’s in singular! In the second sentence, the adj. kupaće is
in A-pl.
The same happens to žvakaća guma chewing gum, usually shortened to just
žvakaća.
________
® In Serbia, the pres. adj. poznavajući is considered non-standard.
In Serbia and most of Bosnia, the meaning liquid is expressed with another adjective:
tečan (tečn-), while tekući means only flowing.

81 Sneeze Once and Start Blooming
Croatian often uses patterns of verb derivation where meanings are derived by
simply adding prefixes. For instance, let’s take the following verb pair:
padati ~ pasti (padne, pao) fall
From it, you can derive e.g. the following verb pairs with specific meanings:
ispadati ~ ispasti (ispadne, ispao) fall out
raspadati ~ raspasti (raspadne, raspao) se² fall apart
upadati ~ upasti (upadne, upao) fall into
All such pairs are of the same kind like the base pair: there’s a process (involving a
kind of ‘falling’ that can be completed). But what about if we add pri- to the base
pair:
pripadati ~ pripasti (pripadne, pripao) ?
The verb pripadati of course means belong, but what should the perfective verb
mean? Belonging is a state; how can you complete it?
It turns out that the perfective verb is used, but in the meaning begin to belong, start
to belong. For verbs that indicate lasting states, associated perfective verbs often
mean entering the state.
Such verbs are often hard to translate into English. The verb pripasti (...) will be
usually translated as given, assigned and so on, or the sentence would be rephrased.
Such perfective verbs that don’t mean completion or accomplishment are
sometimes called inchoative verbs (abbreviated as inch.).
To emphasize that the perfective verb has not the usual meaning of ‘completion’, but
‘getting into a state’, I'll use a double tilde (~~). The prefix za- is often used to make
such verbs:
mrziti ~~ za- («) hate ®
pamtiti ~~ za- memorize
voljeti (voli, volio, voljela) ~~ za- («) love/like
For example:
Ana je zavoljela zeleni čaj. Ana started to love green tea.
Some pairs don’t follow this scheme:
cvjetati ~~ pro- bloom
spavati ~~ zaspati (zaspi) sleep
shvaćati ® ~~ shvatiti understand, realize
sviđati se² ~~ svidjeti (svidi, svidio, svidjela) se² like
The verb zaspati has an alternative, non-standard pres-3 form zaspe that’s quite
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 81 Sneeze Once and Start Blooming
453 / 600

common in more eastern regions of Croatia (and in Serbia, but it’s nowhere
accepted as standard). The perf. verb usually corresponds to English fall asleep:
GoranN je brzo zaspao. Goran quickly fell asleep.
(Historically, the pair meaning sleep was also derived with just za-; however, the
verb spati (spi) sleep is now archaic in most of Croatia; it has been replaced by a
more regular spavati, but the older verb is still used in some dialects.)
Many inchoative verbs can be rephrased using phase verbs, e.g.:
zaplakati (zaplače) start crying = početi plakati
However, some frequent verbs like zaspati (zaspi) are never rephrased – they are
basically the only way to express the meaning fall asleep.
Inchoative verbs referring to states can be used with ‘frame’ and ‘round-trip’ time
expressions. When used with ‘frame’ expressions (za¨ + time), it means how long it
took to enter the state. For example:
Shvatio sam sve za pet minuta. I understood everything in five minutes.
When used with ‘round-trip’ expressions (na¨ + time), it means how long the state
entered held. For example:
Zaspala sam na sat vremena. I fell asleep for an hour.
You’ll sometimes see inchoative verbs used with ordinary time expressions (i.e. with
no prepositions) in the latter sense, i.e. how long the state lasted:
Zaspala sam sat vremena. I fell asleep for an hour. (sometimes used)
Some action verbs that have a meaningful start and completion of action, have two
associated perfective verbs! For such verbs, I will list both perfective verbs:
perfective
impf.
↓
done
↓
begin
↓
plivati ~ ot- ~ za- swim
Such groups of verbs can be called aspect triplets. Such common triplets are:
igrati ~ od- («) ~ za- («) play (game)
pjevati ~ ot- ~ za- sing
svirati ~ od- («) ~ za- («) play (music)
As you can see, the stress behaves the same in both perf. verbs. It really depends on
the base verb.
(Some textbooks use the term inchoative only for verbs which mean entering a
state, and call the start-of-action verbs ingressive. I’ll use one name for both kinds.)
While English often uses get + adjective to express entering a state, Croatian has
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 81 Sneeze Once and Start Blooming
454 / 600

specific verbs:
ogladniti («) perf. get hungry
ozdraviti perf. recover, get healthy
razboljeti (razboli, ...) se² perf. get sick
For some meanings, you can either make someone something, or get something; the
second meaning requires a se² in Croatian, i.e. it’s another example of mediopassive
se², when the subject changes ‘on its own’:
perf. verb
+ A
+ se²
rasplakati (rasplače) drive to tears
burst into tears
rastužiti («)
make sad
get sad
razljutiti («)
make angry
get angry
razveseliti («)
cheer up (someone) cheer up
uvrijediti («)
offend
take offence
Such verbs usually start with ras- or raz-, as you can see. Such verbs sometimes
don’t have impf. pairs at all.
For some meanings in Croatian, there’s a full verb pair that indicates getting into a
state; the impf. verb sees entering a state as a process (e.g. it can take a while to
become sick, it can take a while to get old, etc.):
pokretati (pokreće) ~ pokrenuti (pokrene) get moving
starjeti/stariti ~ o- grow/get old
Therefore, there are verb triplets with two verbs for entering the state: one impf.
and another perf. A parallel in English would be:
I was getting hungry. = enter-impf.
I got hungry. = enter-perf.
I am hungry. = state (impf.)
There are three such triplets for body position verbs, one of them I’ve introduced in
52 Stand, Become, Exist, Cease; we can also list verbs be and become as a kind of
triplet:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 81 Sneeze Once and Start Blooming
455 / 600

enter-impf.
enter-perf.
state (impf.)
lie
lijegati

ležati

stajati
(staje)
stati
(stane)
stajati
(stoji)
be
postajati
(postaje)
postati
(postane)
biti
(je² +)
It’s interesting how all verbs in the last row can have same arguments, i.e. nouns or
adjectives in N:
GoranN postaje gladanN. Goran is getting hungry.
GoranN je postao gladanN. Goran got hungry.
GoranN je gladanN. Goran is hungry.
If we look further, we can find more inchoative triplets, for example:
enter-impf.
enter-perf.
state (impf.)
učiti
learn, study
naučiti («)
learn
znati
know
doznavati (doznaje)
find out,
get to know
doznati
find out,
get to know
upoznavati (upoznaje)
get acquainted with
upoznati
get acq. with
poznavati (poznaje)
know (person, city),
be acquainted with
The pair doznavati (doznaje) ~ doznati is for simple facts, with little effort, while
učiti ~ na- («) is for complex topics (driving a car, Croatian, calculus, etc.). The last
triplet is mostly for ‘knowing’ people and cities.
There is one more type of perfective verbs, where action consists of bits – one
example is sneezing: it’s a sequence of individual sneezes. Croatian has verbs for
both continuous sneezing and for a single sneeze:
kihati (kiše) sneeze (series)
kihnuti (kihne) sneeze (once)
Again, kihnuti (kihne) is a perf. verb – you cannot use it in the present tense, you
cannot tell how long it took, and so on. However, there’s no completion or
accomplishment – only one ‘atomic’ event. To indicate such perf. verbs, I’ll use a
tilde with a small, superscript number one (~¹). Such verbs are:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 81 Sneeze Once and Start Blooming
456 / 600

kapati ~¹ kapnuti (kapne) drip
kucati ~¹ kucnuti (kucne) knock
štucati ~¹ štucnuti (štucne) hiccup
treptati (trepće) ~¹ trepnuti (trepne) blink
As you can see, such verbs frequently end in -nuti, with the regular -ne in pres-3.
Perf. verbs with this ‘once’ meaning sometimes have a fancy name: semelfactive
(abbreviated as smlf.); the corresponding impf. verbs are sometimes called iterative.
This doesn’t apply to all verbs where it could make sense: for instance, there’s no
verb for "cough once".
There are verb pairs where the perf. verbs have meaning similar to ‘atomic’ – they
mean for a short while, a bit. I will classify them as kind-of semelfactive, with the
same mark (~¹), but you should be aware of the small difference. Three most
common pairs like that are:
misliti ~¹ po- think
nadati se² ~¹ po- («) hope
osjećati ~¹ osjetiti feel
The perf. verbs above mean think for a short time and hope for a short time, or have
a thought. They are often used in negative, to emphasize that somebody didn’t think
even for a moment.
Don’t forget that there’s a substantial difference in meaning between verbs like
zavoljeti (...) and pomisliti. The former verbs indicate entering a state which can last
any amount of time – we don’t say how long, and if we want to express when the
state ended, we have to use another verb. The latter ones are ‘atomic’, or small
‘pulses’, indicating that action or state lasted for a small amount of time:
‘inchoative’
(start-of-state)
‘semelfactive’
(atomic / brief)
zaspati (zaspi)
  fall asleep
zavoljeti (zavoli,...)
  start to love
kihnuti (kihne)
  sneeze (once)
pomisliti
  think for a moment
However, there are perf. verbs where the two meanings are mixed. Two common
ones are:
zaželjeti (zaželi,...)
poželjeti (poželi,...)  
   ‘perf.’ wish
From what I’ve explained above, you would expect that poželjeti (...) means wish for
a moment, and that zaželjeti (...) start to wish, but it’s not so – both have meaning
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 81 Sneeze Once and Start Blooming
457 / 600

somewhere in between, and are used interchangeably.
There are also secondary, ‘iterative’ impf. verbs derived from semelfactive verbs. For
example:
pomisliti smlf. think for a moment → pomišljati («)
The relation of these two verbs is like kihnuti (...) vs. kihati (...) – the impf. verb
stands for a series of individual short thoughts, with unspecified time between the
thoughts (it could be hours, or days, or weeks, or more):
misliti impf. think
pomisliti smlf. think for a moment, once
pomišljati («) impf. think once a while
All three verbs are sometimes translated as think, which unfortunately hides various
shades of meaning.
Finally, there are verb pairs that can be understood either as normal impf.-perf.
pairs, or as iterative-semelfactive, depending on the context. Common pairs are:
bacati ~/~¹ baciti throw
pokazivati (-uje «) ~/~¹ pokazati (pokaže) show
In fact, most perf. verbs also can be used in this way, for short events, while most
impf. verbs can be also used for series of short events.

® In Serbia, the verb mrziti hate has the unexpected “Ekavian” form mrzeti (mrzi).
In Serbia and most of Bosnia, the verb shvaćati understand has a bit different form
shvatati; there’s no difference for the inchoative verb.

82 Visible and Unreadable: Potential Adjectives
There’s a group of adjectives derived from many verbs (but not all!) that stand for
potential. They are kind of similar to passive adjectives. English has such adjectives
too: examples are visible and readable.
They are usually derived by adding -ljiv to the verb root (that is, the infinitive form
without -ati, -iti, -jeti, etc.):
čitati read → čit- → čitljiv readable
vidjeti see → vid- → vidljiv visible
They are frequently derived from perf. verbs:
prihvatiti perf. accept → prihvatljiv acceptable
shvatiti inch. understand → shvatljiv understandable
uzbuditi («) perf. excite → uzbudljiv exciting
zapaliti («) perf. ignite → zapaljiv flammable
(Here I have used inch. as short for inchoative verbs, a kind of perfective verbs
introduced in the previous chapter.)
The stress of such adjectives seems to be always on the syllable just before the last
one (that is, one before -ljiv).
Few verbs that end in -siti or -sati have pot. adj. ending only in -siv. Common ones
are:
podesiti perf. adjust → podesiv adjustable
prenositi transport → prenosiv portable
If the consonant that would come before -ljiv is n or nj, it gets fused with lj; some
adjectives have both forms:
promijeniti perf. change → promjenjiv / promjenljiv variable
hraniti feed → hranjiv nutritious
sumnjati suspect → sumnjiv suspicious
(You will sometimes see the spelling sumljiv; that’s considered non-standard and a
gross error by some people.)
Verbs that have pres-3 ending in -e usually don’t derive such adjectives with -ljiv, but
with -iv, and they appear more similar to the infinitive form:
jesti (jede) eat → jestiv eatable
opisati (opiše) perf. describe → opisiv describable
saviti (savije) perf. bend → savitljiv flexible
If the verb contains a sequence -ije-, it’s shortened in the potential adjective to -je-
or just -e- (after r, preceded by another consonant):
dijeliti divide, share → djeljiv divisible
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 82 Visible and Unreadable: Poten!al Adjec!ves
459 / 600

lijepiti glue, stick → ljepljiv sticky
As in English, negated versions of some potential adjectives are more common then
non-negated. The negation is done by simply appending ne- to the front. Common
negated potential adjectives are:
nerazumljiv incomprehensible
neshvatljiv inexplicable
neuništiv indestructible
nevidljiv invisible
The verb piti (pije) drink doesn’t have a regular potential adjective, but a specific
adjective is used:
pitak (pitk-) drinkable, potable
Also, a frequent negative potential adj. has an unexpected form:
nezaboravan (nezaboravn-) unforgettable
Some potential adjectives stand for active ability, especially when someone likes to
do something, or often does something; this happens mostly for verbs related to
talking. For example:
paziti take care → pažljiv careful
pričati tell (stories) → pričljiv talkative
šaliti se² joke → šaljiv funny, humorous
šutjeti / šutiti be silent → šutljiv silent
Few more adjectives have (apparently) non-potential meaning:
dirati touch → dirljiv touching, emotional
hraniti feed → hranjiv nutritious
osjetiti inch. feel → osjetljiv sensitive
smrdjeti / smrditi stink → smrdljiv foul-smelling
strpiti se² perf. be patient → strpljiv patient
zanimati («) be interesting → zanimljiv interesting
Unlike passive adjectives, most potential adjectives are comparable (and always use
the -iji suffix). The stress moves to the suffix (ljiv):
pažljiv careful → pažljiviji more careful
vidljiv visible → vidljiviji more visible
However, you should remember that not all verbs have potential adjectives, even if
it would make sense.
Similar in form to potential adjectives – but not in meaning – are adjectives derived
by adding -av. There are only a couple of them derived from verbs in frequent use:
brbljati chit-chat → brbljav chatty
prljati soil, pollute → prljav dirty
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 82 Visible and Unreadable: Poten!al Adjec!ves
460 / 600

This suffix is used to derive adjectives from certain nouns:
dlaka body hair, animal hair → dlakav hairy
hrđa rust → hrđav rusty ®
krv f blood → krvav bloody
mišić muscle → mišićav muscular
These adjectives never have a case-base with the -a- dropped, while adjectives
which end in -av for other reasons sometimes have, e.g. mrtav (mrtv-) dead.
________
® In Serbia and Bosnia, words for rust and rusty don’t have the initial h: they have

83 Depth and Distance: Abstract Nouns
In Croatian, as in English, many adjectives (e.g. deep) have associated abstract nouns
(e.g. depth).
As in English, various adjectives use various suffixes to create abstract nouns in
Croatian. For some adjectives, -ina gets added to create an abstract noun:
brz fast → brzina speed, velocity
topao (topl-) warm → toplina warmth, heat ®
vješt skilled → vještina skill
vruć hot → vrućina heat (extreme)
Of the two nouns standing for heat, only the noun toplina is used in the generic
sense, e.g. in science. As you can see, the resulting noun has always stress on the i
from the suffix.
Some the derived nouns have a non-abstract meaning:
divlji wild → divljina wilderness
šupalj (šuplj-) hollow → šupljina cavity
Adjectives that discard a part of them when making a comparative (e.g. -ok or -ak),
discard it as well when making abstract nouns:
dubok deep → dubina depth
širok wide → širina width
težak (tešk-) heavy → težina weight
visok high → visina height, altitude
For some adjectives, there’s a shift in consonants, the same as in comparatives:
debeo (debel) thick, fat → debljina thickness
jak strong → jačina strength
tih quiet, silent → tišina silence
(Abstract nouns don’t always have a shift when comparatives have one: for
instance, from visok, the comparative is viši, but the abstract noun is visina, without
the shift s → š.)
Abstract nouns can even be derived from some question-words that behave like
adjectives, and even from few comparatives; results are often very generic nouns:
kolik how big → količina quantity
manji smaller → manjina minority
velik big → veličina size
veći bigger → većina majority
Certain once abstract nouns evolved specific meanings, e.g. nizina means lowlands.
Abstract nouns in -ina have relational adjectives in -ski:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 83 Depth and Distance: Abstract Nouns
462 / 600

dubina depth → dubinski
toplina heat → toplinski
većina majority → većinski
visina height → visinski
Few adjectives make abstract nouns by adding -oća:
čist clean → čistoća cleanliness
gluh deaf → gluhoća deafness
hladan (hladn-) cold → hladnoća cold
Very few adjectives add -ota. If adjectives contain a sequence ije, it’s shortened to
je in abstract nouns:
lijep nice, pretty → ljepota beauty
slijep blind → sljepoća blindness
Next, there are few adjectives that add -stvo, creating neuter nouns (after
discarding the final -n in adjectives, if present). The stress is on the syllable right
before the suffix:
bogat rich → bogatstvo richness
iskusan (iskusn-) experienced → iskustvo experience
siromašan (siromašn-) poor → siromaštvo poverty
zadovoljan (zadovoljn-) satisfied → zadovoljstvo satisfaction
This suffix is use to create abstract nouns out of a couple of other nouns as well (the
process is not always regular):
car emperor → carstvo empire
član member → članstvo membership
kralj king → kraljevstvo kingdom
prijatelj friend → prijateljstvo friendship
The vast majority of adjectives use another suffix to make abstract nouns: -ost (or a
variation, -nost). It can be, in fact, regarded as the default suffix for abstract nouns.
The result is always a feminine noun ending in a consonant:
glup stupid → glupost f stupidity
mlad young → mladost f youth, young age
slab weak → slabost f weakness
star old → starost f age
This suffix creates three quite important nouns, from present adjectives and a past
adjective:
budući future → budućnost f future
moguć possible → mogućnost f possibility
prošao (prošl-) past → prošlost f past
The stress is mostly moved to the syllable that precedes the suffix. More important
nouns created by this suffix:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 83 Depth and Distance: Abstract Nouns
463 / 600

opasan (opasn-) dangerous → opasnost f danger
sličan (sličn-) similar, alike → sličnost f similarity
slučajan (slučajn-) accidental → slučajnost f coincidence
stvaran (stvarn-) real → stvarnost f reality
udaljen distant → udaljenost f distance
važan (važn-) important → važnost f importance
Passive adjectives always use this suffix to create abstract nouns, usually
corresponding to English -ness:
gledan watched (also popular)→ gledanost f viewer ratings
otvoren open → otvorenost f openness
The noun gledanost f means literally watchedness (however, this is an extremely
rare English word).
Potential adjectives always use this suffix to create abstract nouns as well:
vidljiv visible → vidljivost f visibility
osjetljiv sensitive → osjetljivost f sensitivity
This is maybe the place to show the full range of derived words from a single
(perfective) verb (of course, not all verbs have all the possible forms):
verb
adjectives
(verbal) nouns
isključiti («)
perf. exclude
(also turn off)
isključen
excluded
(turned off)
isključenje
excluding
isključenost f
exclusion
isključiv
exclusive,
strict
isključivost f
exclusiveness,
strictness
In addition, there are (for most potential and passive adjectives), negated adjectives,
and derived negated abstract words; for example:
vidljiv visible
vidljivost f visibility
nevidljiv invisible
nevidljivost f invisibility
Such negated adjectives and abstract nouns are always derived by appending ne-.
Some nouns created by -ost have meaning that’s not obvious from the adjective
they are derived from:
umjetan (umjetn-) artificial → umjetnost f art
While English art has a wide meaning, Croatian umjetnost f means only painting,
making sculptures and other high arts.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 83 Depth and Distance: Abstract Nouns
464 / 600

Some nouns changed meaning over time, or the adjectives they were created from
fell out of use:
prednost f priority, advantage
radost f joy
znanost f science ®
žalost f sadness
Abstract nouns that don’t end in -ina usually don’t have relational adjectives – the
adjectives they are derived from are used in relational meaning too – or form
relational adjectives irregularly:
starost f old age → starački
umjetnost f art → umjetnički
znanost f science → znanstven scientific ®
The relational adjectives starački and umjetnički are actually derived from nouns
starac (starc-) old man and umjetnik artist.
Finally, it’s interesting that there are more abstract feminine nouns that don’t end in
-a, which seem to be (at least historically) derived with -t. Common ones are:
bit f essence, gist
čast f honor
moć f might, power
pomoć f help
povijest f history ®
propast f downfall
smrt f death
strast f passion
vijest f news
vlast f authority, government
________
® The word znanost f science is specific to Croatia. In Bosnia and Serbia, the word
nauka is more common; instead of toplina heat, toplota is used in Bosnia and
Serbia. For nauka, the relational adjective is simply naučni.
Instead of povijest, the word for history is historija in parts of Bosnia, and istorija in
Serbia and parts of Bosnia with Serbian majority.
• Something Possibly Interesting
Present irregularities can be a key to history. Nouns like moć might, power end in -ć,
while other similar nouns end in -t. Likewise, inf of the verb can is moći, while most
verbs have infinitives in -ti. Besides, the verb is highly irregular.
The most likely explanation is this: some time ago – likely more than 1200 years,
maybe much more – the verb can had inf something like mogtī, and the abstract
noun was mogti (the difference was length of the last vowel). Therefore, the past
forms and pres-1 were and still are fully regular (mog-la, mog-u). (I’m here
simplifying things a bit: in the distant past, the past and present endings were a bit
different; also, the o in mog- wasn’t really an o.)
But then, for unknown reasons, sequences kti and gti changed their pronunciations
into ći (the sound wasn’t of today ć, but an early version of it, a kind of softened t).

Later, short i’s were dropped from ends of words (as from most other positions as
well). So, we are now left with t vs. ć.
Also, note the similarity of mog-tī with English may, might and German mögen, mag.
If we would go back in time, we would find many more similarities.

Croatia. This speech is also quite well known to people in the surrounding area, and
they usually use it in some circumstances (they use their home dialect at home and
among friends).
The language spoken in Rijeka, the third biggest city in Croatia, is similar to Zagreb in
many aspects. The following features are common to both Zagreb and Rijeka:
1. Use of 'western stress'. For instance, the verb dolaziti will be stressed on the
second syllable.
2. No distinction in pronunciation of č vs. ć and đ vs. dž, and no distinction in vowel
length.
3. Infinitives without the final -i all the time.
4. Yes/no questions where unstressed forms are used as stressed, and simply put at
the first position:
— Si ga vidio? Did you see him?
— Se bojiš? Are you afraid?
The Standard Croatian stressed form of si is jesi, while the particle se² cannot be
used like that in Standard Croatian at all!
5. There are some specific words often used in both Zagreb and Rijeka, for example
(the standard form is on the right):
di where :: gdje
People from Zagreb will in colloquial settings also use the following features
(starting from most common):
Adverbs ending in a vowel without the final vowel. Besides examples like sad / sada,
found in many places, there will be words like (Standard forms are on the right):
ak if :: ako
kak how :: kako
tak so :: tako
Specific words (some of them are common in certain other regions as well):
niš nothing :: ništa
(the rest is coming soon...)

85 Small and Cute: Diminutives
Croatian – as many other languages, but unlike English – has mechanisms for
creating nouns standing for miniature versions of things. Those words are often
applied to babies, children, and parts of them, and therefore stand for ‘cute’ and
‘dear’ things as well.
For instance, in Croatian you can say that a baby has a glava head, but people prefer
to call it glavica little head. Such words are called diminutives and usually have a
different emotional content.
Diminutives are words that are derived through a process that’s only partially
regular. Not all nouns have a diminutive, and there are various endings to derive
them – they are like relational adjectives in that manner.
For nouns ending in -a, the main way to form diminutives is by replacing -a with -ica.
The result is another noun, again ending in -a:
glava head → glavica
krava cow → kravica
kiša rain → kišica
kuća house → kućica
pčela bee → pčelica
riba fish → ribica
tata m dad → tatica m
žena woman/wife → ženica
As you can see, this applies to words like tata as well – the result is a word that
corresponds to English Daddy.
In some meanings, diminutives are always used: for example the golden fish from
stories, who grants wishes, is always zlatna ribica.
Certain nouns ending in -ka or -ga shift consonants (like k → č, g → ž etc.) but it
doesn’t happen to all nouns – forms must be learned:
baka grandmother → bakica
daska plank → daščica
mačka cat → mačkica
ptica bird → ptičica
ruka hand, arm → ručica
noga foot, leg → nožica
For some words, you’ll encounter both forms, e.g. nožica and nogica (forms with
unchanged consonants are more common in the wider Zagreb area).
Croatian has two words for girl – one is colloquial, and another more formal; the
derived diminutives have the same use:
cura (colloq.) girl → curica
djevojka (formal) girl → djevojčica
Certain diminutives have specific meanings. For example, ručica also means handle
(e.g. on a door). More examples of a slight shift in meaning:
tikva pumpkin → tikvica zucchini (courgette)
torba bag → torbica purse
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 85 Small and Cute: Diminu!ves
468 / 600

vreća sack → vrećica small bag, shopping bag ®
žlica spoon → žličica teaspoon ®
For masculine nouns in a consonant, the main way is to add -ić, as if it were a case
ending (it’s, of course, not a case ending):
ključ key → ključić
kolač cake → kolačić
komad piece → komadić ®
list leaf → listić
nos nose → nosić
most bridge → mostić
nož knife → nožić
prst finger → prstić
zid wall → zidić
zub tooth → zubić
You can see how the stress for words like kolač shifts, as always when anything is
added to them. Again, for babies and small children, people prefer to call their body
parts prstić, nosić and so on.
For a few words (there’s no rule, as far as I can tell) -čić is added instead:
kamen stone → kamenčić
prozor window → prozorčić
For some nouns, consonants are shifted before -ić or -čić (e.g. c, k → č, h → š etc.):
lanac (lanc-) chain → lančić
krug circle → kružić
rak crab → račić
zec rabbit, bunny → zečić
The word lančić is always used for fine chains worn around the neck, while lanac is a
heavy thing used to close gates, to lift loads etc.
Like for feminine nouns, certain diminutives have developed specific meanings:
brat brother → bratić cousin
novac (novc-) money → novčić coin
Historically, bratić meant something like ‘brother’s small (boy)’, and this was
extended to name people after their fathers by diminutives:
Ivo → Ivić
Jure → Jurić
Mate → Matić
Tomo → Tomić
These were later used as last names – so you now understand why there are so
many last names in Croatia and neighboring countries ending in -ić.
Sometimes, you’ll see diminutives from neuter nouns, derived with -ce, with many
irregularities:
drvo tree → drvce
jezero lake → jezerce
sunce sun → sunašce
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 85 Small and Cute: Diminu!ves
469 / 600

It’s interesting that the very word sunce is likely originally a diminutive as well.
However, in Kajkavian areas – generally the area around Zagreb, and north and
northeast from Zagreb – another suffix to create masculine and neuter diminutives
prevails: -ek (-eko for neuters). Since Zagreb is Kajkavian-influenced, you will find
such words in Zagreb as well, usually:
medo teddy bear → medek
srce heart → srčeko
   (NW Croatia)
These words are common when people talk to small children. In NW Croatia,
diminutives are generallly much more used than in other regions of Croatia: people
will tell children to eat juhica and meseko which basically has no meaning except to
sweeten the words juha soup and meso meat.
Similar to diminutives, but distinct, are hypocorisms, also known as pet names or
nicknames. They are alternative words for things and people used within family,
especially by children. One hypocorism is already mentioned above: medo for the
usual medvjed bear.
Words mama Mom and tata m Dad are also, historically, a kind of hypocorisms.
Hypocorisms for personal names are mostly fixed in language; as in English, they
usually involve shortening of names (in Croatian, to two syllables) and simplifying
them:
Branimir → Branko
Ivan → Ivo / Ive
Juraj → Jure / Jura
Katarina → Kata
Petar (Petr-) → Pero ®
Tomislav → Tomo ®
Vladimir → Vlado ®
Zvonimir → Zvonko / Zvone
Some nicknames have two forms; ones with -e are characteristic for Dalmatia, while
ones with -o or -a are characteristic for inland Croatia. In Kajkavian regions, you
would also hear forms ending in -ek:
Ivan → Ivek (NW Croatia)
Compare this to English names William → Bill or Robert → Bob. Many such nickames
are used as real names as well.
Diminutive-making mechanism is also applied to names and nicknames that end in -a
or behave so, to make diminutive names:
Branka → Brankica
Kata → Katica
Ruža → Ružica
Ivo → Ivica m
Jure → Jurica m
Pero → Perica m
This is similar to English Bill → Billy, Rose → Rosie and Bob → Bobby.
Interestingly, a couple of verbs in Croatian have diminutive versions too! They are
usually formed by inserting -k- before the verb ending. The process is not regular,
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 85 Small and Cute: Diminu!ves
470 / 600

and only a limited number of verbs have diminutives:
gristi (grize, grizao, grizla) bite → grickati nibble
lupati knock, bang → lupkati tap
Some diminutive verbs are derived with -uc- or -ut-:
kašljati (kašlje) cough → kašljucati cough lightly
skakati (skače) jump → skakutati (skakuće) hop, bounce
For example, we would use the verb grickati nibble when someone eats a cracker or
biscuit by small bites, especially children.
So, diminutives are largely irregular, but they are similar enough to the original word
so that you can recognize their meaning quickly, even if you’re not familiar with the
diminutive word.
________
® Instead of žlica and žličica, words kašika and kašičica are used in Serbia and most
of Bosnia.
Instead of vreća and vrećica, kesa and kesica are used in Serbia and most of Bosnia,
but the non-diminutive kesa is used for shopping bag.
Besides komad and komadić, words parče (parčet-) and parčence are used in
Serbia and parts of Bosnia.
Hypocorisms like Pero and Tomo have forms ending in -a (Pera, Toma...) in Serbia,
except in the southwest of Serbia.

86 More Verbs and Standing Outcomes
I’ll explain several useful verbs and verb families here, and also introduce a couple of
advanced topics.
The first verb family is derived in this pattern:
tvoriti
o-tvarati («) ~ o-tvoriti («)
The base verb, tvoriti, is quite rare. The derived pairs are not:
prefix
used with
meaning
o-
A
open
pri-
A
leave ajar (‘almost close’)
za-
A
close
pre-
A (u¨ A)
transform
s-
A
create
se²
show up (colloq.)
There’s not much to say about the first three verbs: they express open and close –
either literal (window, shop), or metaphoric (discussion, person).
The last two verbs have specific meanings. The pre- verb is similar to transport verbs
derived by pre-: it uses destinations (expressed by u¨ + A) and optionally also origins
(expressed by iz¨ + G, matching the destination). The verb is used with either an
object in A, or a se² (mediopassively, if something transforms ‘on its own’):
Mali problemN se pretvorio u velikiA. A small problem has transformed into a big
one.
The verb pair otvarati («) ~ otvoriti («) open can illustrate a fine point when
perfective verbs are used and where not. If you opened a window, and then closed
it – and it’s a bit cold now in the room – and you want to express with a single verb
what you did, you would use the imperfective verb:
Otvarao sam prozorA. I opened the window. (It’s maybe closed now.)
If you use the impf. verb, it doesn’t imply that the window is open now, or that it
remained open for some time – but such things would be implied if you would use
the perf. verb:
Otvorio sam prozorA. I’ve opened the window. (And it’s open now.)
This is the ‘standing outcome’ principle. This is because perf. verbs focus on the
outcome, but the outcome – state of the window – is not relevant here (or not
expected). It’s important that you touched it. An obvious way to say it’s not open
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 86 More Verbs and Standing Outcomes
472 / 600

3m/n
3m/n
anymore is this:
Otvorio sam prozorA i poslije gaA zatvorio. I’ve opened the window and
closed it later.
So, the second verb ‘undoes’ the first. It’s actually more general: only the last
perfective verb in the sequence counts. That is, if you say:
Otvorio sam prozorA i oprao gaA. I’ve opened the window and washed it.
It would imply only it’s washed now, not whether it’s open or closed. This is a very
subtle, but important principle: only the last outcome in a sequence ‘stands’. We
could paraphrase it as the last outcome standing! This likely sounds extremely
complicated, but an example will make it (hopefully) clear (‘standing outcomes’ are
in red):
example
implies
Išla sam u trgovinuA.
I was going/went to the shop.
imperfective!
no implications whatsoever
Otišla sam u trgovinuA.
I have gone to the shop.
(I’m in the shop)
Otišla sam u trgovinuA i kupila pivoA.
I went to the shop and bought beer.
(I have some beer)
Otišla sam u trgovinuA, kupila pivoA i popila gaA.
I went to the shop, bought beer and drank it.
(no beer; I might be drunk)
Pala sam.
I fell.
involuntary event!
no implications
However, the ‘standing outcome’ doesn’t apply to all perf. verbs – only to voluntary
ones. Check the last row: pala sam doesn’t imply I’m still on the floor: it’s not
something I did voluntary. It just happened.
Note that the impf. verb doesn’t really say we got to the shop at all. It just says we
were going there, there was some action. But if we don’t say there were some
problems on the way there, it’s enough. So the default, shortest way of saying
something with a ‘standing outcome’ – if the ‘standing outcome’ doesn’t hold
anymore – would be actually using the impf. verb.
Therefore, perf. involuntary verbs are used much more often than voluntary ones.
In real life, this rule is not completely clear-cut: you will hear both just išla sam u
trgovinu and otišla sam u trgovinu for completed actions in the past and for
speaker being obviously not in the shop anyomore.
The important thing is that you will hear impf. verbs where you would naively – due
to completion – expect perf. ones. Always keep in mind that perf. verbs are not just
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 86 More Verbs and Standing Outcomes
473 / 600

about completed actions, but also about the outcomes, especially for voluntary
actions – and the outcome of going somewhere is being there.
There’s another way to distance yourself from a past action expressed by a
voluntary perfective verb – by using another tense, not yet described: the so-called
plusquamperfect tense (in English, the name is often simplified to pluperfect tense).
It roughly corresponds to he had opened and like.
The tense is formed like the common past tense, but there’s an extra past form of
the verb biti (je² +), in the same gender and number as the other past form:
Gledala sam filmA. I was watching the movie. (fem. speaking)
Bila sam gledala filmA. (pluperfect)
You can visualize it as putting the verb in the past twice:
present
gledam I’m watching
  ↓
  ...put the verb gledati into the past
past
gledala sam I was watching
  ↓
  ...put the verb biti (je² +) into the past
pluperfect
bila sam gledala I had been watching
Using this tense, we can put a distance from the action – there’s no ‘standing
outcome’:
Bio sam otvorio prozorA. I had opened the window. (But it was maybe closed later.)
It also serves to emphasize actions and states, like I was really doing it, I really did it,
it has really happened:
Bila sam gledala filmA. I was really watching the movie.
Bio sam otvorio prozorA. I did open the window. (despite it being closed now)
However, this tense is actually very rare in speech, just check these Google™ results
(from the .hr domain):

You will find this tense occasionally in literature. There are actually even more
tenses you’ll see sometimes in writing; they will be described in 99 Aorist Tense and
Other Marginal Features.
Let’s go back to verbs. The next family is weird – there’s no base verb (or pair) – all
verbs have prefixes. They are made attaching prefixes to this:
-premati («) ~ -premiti («)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 86 More Verbs and Standing Outcomes
474 / 600

Common verbs in this family are:
prefix
used with
meaning
o-
A
equip
pos-
A (dest)
tidy, put to place
pri-
A (za¨ A1) prepare
s-
A (dest)
put to its place
make ready *
do-
A (dest)
deliver
The pair derived with pri- has a simple meaning, prepare. It’s used with an object or
with a se²:
Pripremio sam ručakA. I’ve prepared lunch.
Pripremio sam se. I’ve prepared (myself).
You can express what for the preparation was with za¨ + A:
Pripremio sam se za putA. I’ve prepared for the trip.
The most interesting verb pair is spremati ~ spremiti (since the prefix is merely a
consonant, the stress shift in the present tense is not possible – the stress is always
on the first syllable).
This verb pair has the basic meaning: bring something/someone to the
optimal/requested state. It’s basically used for three things. First, to put things back
to their places, e.g. if a book is out of its usual place (shelf), a toy is out of the box,
etc.:
Spremio sam knjigeA. I’ve put the books back in place.
If the place is expressed, it’s a destination:
Spremio sam knjigeA na policuA. I've put the books back to the shelf.
Then, this pair covers the meanings expressed by the pri- pair:
Spremio sam ručakA. I’ve prepared lunch.
Spremio sam se. I’ve prepared (myself).
Finally, the third meaning is tidy:
Spremio sam sobuA. I’ve tidied the room
Next, there are two interesting verb families. One is derived like this:
vršiti
do-vršavati («) ~ do-vršiti («)
The base verb is sometimes used, in meaning do, make. Three derived pairs are quite
common:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 86 More Verbs and Standing Outcomes
475 / 600

prefix
used with
meaning
do-
A
finalize, complete
iz-
A
carry out, execute
za-
A
end, terminate
One derived pair matches the meaning of a phase verb pair I’ve already introduced:
počinjati (počinje / počinje) ~ početi (počne, počeo) start
završavati («) ~ završiti («) end
This verb pair is very useful:
navikavati («) ~ naviknuti (navikne) (AX / se²) (na YA) get/become used (X) (to Y)
You’ll see this pair with the prefix pri- with roughly the same meaning, and with the
prefix od- in the opposite meaning, like colloquial English ‘get unused’.
Next, there are four common verb pairs derived from this ‘pair’:
-ključivati (-ključuje) ~ -ključiti («)
Common verbs in this family are:
prefix

is-
A (orig)
exclude, switch off

87 Player, Playroom and Playground: Common
Derivations
In this chapter, I will explain how various derived nouns, such as player, playroom
and playground are derived in Croatian.
The simplest nouns derived from verbs are of ‘player’ type. You simply remove the
infinitive ending, and the vowel before it (if any) and add -ač:
verb
‘player’ noun
birati choose
birač elector, voter
glasati vote
glasač voter
igrati play
igrač player
kupati bathe
kupač bather
pjevati sing
pjevač singer
plivati swim
plivač swimmer
plesati (pleše) dance
plesač dancer
pušiti smoke
pušač smoker
trčati (trči) run
trkač runner
voziti drive
vozač driver
As you can see, all these words are stressed in the same way: the ‘western’ stress on
-ač, and the standard stress on the syllable before it – therefore, the standard stress
moves in all these words:
igrač player → A igrača
The feminine versions are simply derived by adding -ica (and consequently moving
the standard stress):
igrač player (m) → igračica player (f) 
pjevač singer (m) → pjevačica singer (f) 
vozač driver (m) → vozačica driver (f)
While these nouns usually stand for people who do something, others derived in the
same way can stand for various hardware too (I’ve listed only derived nouns; you
can find verbs in a dictionary easily):
čitač reader
nosač carrier / prop
grijač heater ®
otvarač opener
prekidač switch
pokrivač cover
punjač charger
upaljač lighter
The word čitač reader is related to devices only (e.g. card reader, e-book reader):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 87 Player, Playroom and Playground: Common Deriva!ons
477 / 600

the word for a person who reads will be explained below.
However, not all verbs make nouns with -ač: some use -telj, and they always mean
persons; the most common ones are:
verb
‘player’ noun
čitati read
čitatelj reader
gledati watch
gledatelj watcher
graditi build
graditelj builder
natjecati (natječe) se² compete
natjecatelj competitor ®
roditi give birth
roditelj parent
slušati listen
slušatelj listener
As you can see, these nouns have the stress always on the third syllable from the
end, and preserve the vowel before the infinitive ending.
The feminine versions of these nouns are simply derived by adding -ica and moving
the stress to -telj-:
čitatelj reader (m) → čitateljica reader (f) 
gledatelj watcher (m) → gledateljica watcher (f)
However, the noun roditelj parent is usually used in masculine forms only, regardless
of person’s sex.
Some of these verbs have a bit colloquial alternative nouns ® which end in -lac, with
the ‘case-base’ -oc-, while some other verbs have -lac (-oc-) nouns only:
verb
‘player’ noun
čitati read
čitalac (čitaoc-) reader
(colloq.) ®
gledati watch
gledalac (čitaoc-) watcher
slušati listen
slušalac (čitaoc-) listener
misliti think
mislilac (mislioc-) thinker
nositi carry
nosilac (nosioc-) carrier
roniti dive
ronilac (ronioc-) diver
It’s interesting that these nouns are often regularized in real life (to their case-base),
so you’ll hear (and read) mislioc, nosioc, ronioc etc. as well – just check the
Google™ hits (on the .hr domain):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 87 Player, Playroom and Playground: Common Deriva!ons

ronilac
20900
ronioc
9980
form
  hits
nosilac
24400
nosioc
11700
However, some people think such regularized forms are signs of uneducated speech
and writing (but it seems they are getting more common, and they can be found
even in texts published on universities).
Then, a couple of verbs derive such nouns with -ac (-c-):
verb
‘player’ noun
boriti se² fight
borac (borc-) fighter
glumiti act
glumac (glumc-) actor
loviti catch, hunt
lovac (lovc-) hunter
kupiti perf. buy
kupac (kupc-) buyer
pisati (piše) write
pisac (pisc-) writer
It’s interesting that only few of -lac and -ac nouns have feminine versions; from the
nouns above, only this one has the feminine version:
glumac (glumc-) actor → glumica actress
(There’s a lot of debate should feminine forms of these nouns be
introduced/invented or not.)
But that’s not all. There are also two suffixes used to derive such nouns that get
attached to both verbs and nouns: one of them is -ar:
verb
‘player’ noun
kuhati cook
kuhar cook ®
slikati paint (pictures) slikar painter
meso meat
mesar butcher
pošta post
poštar postman
riba fish
ribar fisherman
stol table ®
stolar carpenter
ura clock (see below)
urar watchmaker ®
zid wall
zidar mason
zub tooth
zubar dentist
The word ura is considered today a bit archaic, dialectal and non-standard, but the
term for watchmaker is still derived from it.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 87 Player, Playroom and Playground: Common Deriva!ons
479 / 600

With this suffix, the stress is basically unpredictable, as you can see, but it seems
that with verbs, the more common pattern is the stress on the first syllable, while
nouns derived from nouns get the ‘western’ stress on -ar, and the standard stress on
the syllable before it – which makes the standard stress again movable.
The suffix -ar derives nouns from verb roots, which might be visible only in past
forms or in the present tense:
peći (peče, pekao, pekla) bake → pekar baker
From such nouns, feminine versions are derived in the usual way:
kuhar cook (m) → kuharica cook (f) 
slikar painter (m) → slikarica painter (f) 
zubar dentist (m) → zubarica dentist (f) ®
Another suffix that gets attached to both verbs and nouns is -nik:
verb
‘player’ noun
koristiti use
korisnik user
liječiti cure
liječnik physician ®
početi (počne) perf. begin
početnik beginner
vjerovati (vjeruje) believe
vjernik believer
ljubav f love
ljubavnik lover
moć f might, ability
moćnik person in power
put way
putnik traveler
rad work
radnik worker
rat war
ratnik warrior
vlast f government, rule
vlasnik owner
(The form početnik is derived a bit irregularly; the loss of -t- in korisnik and vlasnik
is regular in Croatian, recall the adjective bolestan (bolesn-) sick, where the -t- is
lost between s and n.)
From all such nouns, feminine nouns are derived in this way:
putnik traveler (m) → putnica traveler (f)
vlasnik owner (m) → vlasnica owner (f)
However, there are nouns derived with -nik that have nothing to do with people:
čaj tea → čajnik teapot
riječ f word → rječnik dictionary
ruda ore → rudnik mine
ruka hand/arm → ručnik towel
zlato gold → zlatnik gold coin
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 87 Player, Playroom and Playground: Common Deriva!ons
480 / 600

Finally, a couple of verbs have two derived nouns — one for the person who is kind
of ‘giving’, and another for the one who is ‘receiving’. The most common one is:
učiti study / teach →
učitelj teacher
učenik student
From it, feminine versions are regularly derived, as described earlier.
There are two more nouns that are derived from some verbs: one stands for
‘playroom’, and another for ‘playground’. The first type is derived with -onica, after
removing the infinitive ending -ti:
verb
‘playroom’ noun
igrati play
igraonica playroom
kupati bathe
kupaonica bathroom
učiti study / teach
učionica classroom
You’ll often see shortened versions of these nouns, with only -ona, e.g. kupaona for
bathroom; they are understood as a bit colloquial.
There are more terms where more than one word is used; the most common
example are the words for bakery:
pekara 
pekarna (colloq., common in Zagreb)
pekarnica (standard, but less common)
 
  bakery
For instance, on this bakery in Zagreb, there’s both pekara and pekarna:
Another term which has more than one word is flower shop, but this time, the
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 87 Player, Playroom and Playground: Common Deriva!ons
481 / 600

variation is regional:
cvjećarnica (Zagreb, elsewhere)
cvjetarna (Rijeka area)
   flower shop
For instance, on this flower shop in a small town near Rijeka, it’s cvjetarna:
Finally, there are ‘ground’ nouns, derived usually with -lište:
verb
‘playground’ noun
igrati play
igralište playground
graditi build
gradilište building site
kupati bathe
kupalište bathing place, area
parkirati («) park (a car) parkiralište parking area
Some nouns have a bit specific meanings:
gledati watch → gledalište auditorium 
kazati (kaže) say → kazalište theater ®
Colloquially, besides parkiralište, just parking is used for parking lot.
________
® The word grijač heater is used in an unexpected “Ekavian” form grejač in Serbia.
The word stol table is used in the form sto (stol-) m in Serbia and most of Bosnia.
Instead of natjecati (natječe) se² compete, the verb takmičiti se² is more common in
Serbia and most of Bosnia; from it, the noun takmičar is derived.
Nouns like čitalac (čitaoc-) are standard in Serbia and most of Bosnia, while
alternative nouns like čitatelj – standard and common in Croatia – are very rare in
Serbia; however, when there’s only one form (e.g. roditelj parent), it’s common and
standard in all countries.
Instead of the verb kuhati cook, the form kuvati is used in Serbia (where it’s
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 87 Player, Playroom and Playground: Common Deriva!ons
482 / 600

standard) and a part of Bosnia with Serbian majority. The derived noun is kuvar.
Instead of urar watchmaker, the word časovničar is used in Serbia and parts of
Bosnia.
With some nouns in -ar, another suffix to derive feminine versions is used in Serbia
and often in Bosnia: -ka, e.g. zubarka dentist (f).
In most of Bosnia, the word for physician isn’t derived from the verb liječiti cure, but
from lijek medicine, with -ar: ljekar; in Serbia, the “Ekavian” form lekar is used.
Instead of kazalište, the word for theater in Serbia and most of Bosnia is pozorište.

88 Weird Words and Constructions
There are a few details in Croatian which don’t really fit into the overall scheme of
things.
First, there’s a phrase which can be used to express color. It uses a color adjective
before the noun boja color, but both are the genitive case (singular):
MajicaN je crvene bojeG. lit. The T-shirt is ‘of red color’.
HlačeN su plave bojeG. lit. The pants are ‘of blue color’. ®
Such expressions are old-fashioned and mostly obsolete. However, they are used in
questions, i.e. when you ask what color is something. The answer would be just a
color adjective, but in genitive singular (feminine, after boja color):
Koje bojeG je majicaN? What color is the T-shirt?
— CrveneG. (G fem.) Red.
— CrvenaN. (N fem.) Red.
Koje bojeG je autoN? What color is the car?
— CrneG. (G fem.) Black.
— CrniN. (N masc.) Black.
Alternatively, you can answer with an adjective in nominative, matching gender of
the thing the question is about, as in the examples above.
This reminds of English expressions like men of honor, book of great importance, and
so on. In fact, you will occasionally see more or less the same expressions in
Croatian, using od¨ + G:
KnjigaN je od velike važnostiG. The book is of great importance.
Then, there are expressions – often overlooked in grammars and textbooks – when
two nouns are used together, e.g. king George or Hotel California. The last noun is a
proper noun, i.e. a name (e.g. California), and a common noun before it describes its
title (e.g. king) or kind (e.g. hotel).
Croatian uses such expressions more often than English, e.g. in names of rivers,
lakes, cities and countries:
rijeka Sava the Sava river (lit. ‘river Sava’)
jezero Jarun the Jarun lake (lit. ‘lake Jarun’)
Grad Zagreb the City of Zagreb (lit. ‘City Zagreb’)
Republika Hrvatska the Republic of Croatia
Now, in some of these expressions, both nouns change case, and in others, the last
word (the name) is ‘frozen’ in N.
If nouns stand for a person (or an animal, as Croatian almost always treats humans
as a kind of animal), both nouns always change (examples show the accusative
case):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 88 Weird Words and Construc!ons
484 / 600

moj prijatelj Igor my friend Igor → mog prijatelja Igora
teta Ana aunt Ana → tetu Anu ®
This also applies to the following nouns:
grad city
rijeka river
For example (u¨ + DL):
grad Rijeka the City of Rijeka → u gradu Rijeci
grad Split the City of Split → u gradu Splitu
rijeka Drava the Drava river → u rijeci Dravi
Since a great majority of rivers have feminine names in Croatian, use of rijeka river
with masculine names of rivers is avoided. (Croatian so strongly prefers feminine
river names, that even names like the Thames and the Rhine are adapted as
feminine Temza and Rajna). You will mostly see ‘frozen’ masc. names of rivers, e.g.
u rijeci Dunav:
rijeka Dunav the Danube river → (?) u rijeci Dunavu
After most other nouns, only feminine names can change, but it’s optional – names
are usually not changed. Often used nouns are:
hotel hotel
jezero lake
kazalište theater ®
općina municipality ®
For example (again u¨ + DL):
hotel Panorama → u hotelu Panorama / u hotelu Panorami
kazalište Komedija → u kazalištu Komedija / u kazalištu Komediji
You will see changed feminine names now and then. However, masculine names are
always ‘frozen’:
hotel Westin → u hotelu Westin
jezero Jarun → u jezeru Jarun
kazalište Kerempuh → u kazalištu Kerempuh
Bear in mind that ‘freezing’ happens only if a general noun is before the name, if the
name is on it’s own, it of course always changes, e.g. u Westinu, u Jarunu, etc.
Standard Croatian prescribes that both nouns have to be always changed, but it’s
rare, even in writing (e.g. the form u hotelu Westin is more than 100 times more
common than u hotelu Westinu on the Internet).
Occasionally, you’ll see a kind of reversal of the structure described above, where a
proper noun (i.e. a name) describes a common noun; an example is this tube of
mayonnaise:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 88 Weird Words and Construc!ons
485 / 600

Such combinations appear as a kind of indeclinable adjective + a noun, in writing and
in speech, where the word majoneza mayonnaise ® is in A, but the name preceding it
is not:
Voliš Zvijezda majonezuA? Do you like Zvijezda mayonnaise?
(The last sentence is an example from the internet, promoting the product.)
We continue with more ‘weird’ things: end-stressed nouns ®. There’s a number of
nouns – all loanwords, that is, words taken from other languages – that end on a
stressed vowel (other than a). Despite the ending, they are all masculine, and the
end vowel is never dropped – case endings are simply attached to it. Examples are:
file filet → u fileu
kanu canoe → u kanuu
separe restoran booth → u separeu
The two consecutive vowels are pronounced separately, e.g. DL kanuu is
pronounced as three syllables: ka-nu-u.
Then, most masculine nouns in -a in plural can get feminine adjectives and past
forms, although masculine adjectives and past forms are common too ®. For
example:
UbojicaN je uhvaćenN. The murderer was captured. ®
UbojiceN su uhvaćeniN. The murderers were captured.
UbojiceN su uhvaćeneN. (also possible, the same meaning)
This virtually never happens for the noun tata m Dad – it’s almost always considered
masculine in plural.®
There’s one use of masculine gender that’s completely unexpected. The rule is: if
two neuter nouns are linked by an i¨, and they are not both in plural, they together
behave as masculine plural, i.e. adjectives and past forms are in masculine plural
have to be used:
MoreN i neboN su bili crniN. The sea and the sky were black.
JeloN i pićeN nisu uključeniN. Food and drink are not included.
However, if both nouns are neuter and both are in plural, the neuter adjectives and
past forms in plural are used:
RamenaN i koljenaN su ogrebanaN. Shoulders and knees are scratched.
This is a completely weird rule, I have to admit. Even weirder, it often applies to
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 88 Weird Words and Construc!ons
486 / 600

p
y
pp
feminine nouns not ending in -a:
SolN i mastN nisu bili skupiN. Salt and lard were not expensive. ®
The last feature seems to depend on the region.
(The rest is coming soon)
________
® Instead of the words above, these words are used in Serbia and most of Bosnia:
hlače pants, trousers → pantalone
majoneza mayonnaise → majonez
kazalište theater → pozorište
sol f salt → so (sol-) f 
općina municipality → opština
ubojica murderer → ubica
Occasionally in Serbia, the family relation noun is not declined when before the
name, so you might hear and read teta Anu, sometimes spelled with a hyphen: teta-
Anu.
In some regions, and in parts of Serbia and Bosnia, words like kanu etc. are not
stressed on the last syllable. There’s a lot of variation among speakers from various
regions.
While Standard Serbian accepts masculine nouns in -a as both masculine and
feminine in plural, in actual speech in Serbia such words are understood only as
feminine in plural. Check the Google™ statistics (on the .rs domain) for gazda m
landlord, boss and tata m Dad:
novi gazde
52
nove gazde
7120
naši tate
4
naše tate
124
And when you examine the small number of occurrences of novi gazde, you find
that most of them are written by someone in Croatia.

89 Customs and Traditions
This chapter will give a brief overview of words and expressions used in some
Croatian traditions.
There are two verb pairs for marry: one is from the female perspective, another
from the male perspective:
female: udavati (udaje) se² ~ udati se²
male:
ženiti se² ~ o- («)
You would use the first verb if the subject is a woman, and the second verb if the
subject is a man.
However, if the subject is a couple, the male version is used:
Oženit će se. They will get married.
Such reciprocal use of this verb pair is very common, but some Standard Croatian
manuals don’t accept it, and suggest using another, gender-neutral verb pair (which
is a bit archaic, and seldom used in speech):
vjenčavati («) se² ~ vjenčati se² marry (Std; rare in speech)
It’s possible, but slightly old-fashioned to use both verb pairs without the se²: then
the subjects are parents, while one who gets married is the object – again, if your
daughter gets married, you would use the first verb, if your son gets married, the
second one.
The most important holidays in Croatia are:
Božić Christmas
Uskrs Easter
Nova godina New Year
Svi sveti All Saints’ Day
All except Nova godina New Year are Christian holidays. As most people in Croatia
are Catholics, they are celebrated on the same dates as in most West European and
North American countries ®. It’s a custom to give presents (esp. to children) for
Christmas. The day before Christmas, when preparations are made, has a special
name, but it’s not an official holiday (many people, if they are able to, will take a day
of vacation, but others will work):
Badnjak Christmas Eve
All these days, except the All Saint’s Day, will have specially prepared meals (e.g.
Badnjak will have fish). On the All Saint’s Day, many people will visit family graves
(since great crowds gather at that day, many people will visit graves few days earlier
or a day later).
Another holiday of some importance is:
Prvi maj (colloq.) May 1st
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 89 Customs and Tradi!ons
488 / 600

Observe how its name diverts from the usual grammar rules, you would rather
expect Prvi (dan mjeseca) maja.
In some regions, esp. with more religious (Catholic) people, there’s a tradition to
celebrate various holidays dedicated to Virgin Mary.
As in some other countries, there’s a period in late winter, known as Carnival, when
masked processions and specific rituals occur ®. It culminates on the Tuesday 41
days before Easter. There are various names in Croatia, the common ones are:
karneval
fašnik
maškare f pl.
mesopust
poklade f pl.
pust
The word fašnik is most common in Zagreb and the northwestern area; other names
prevail elsewhere. For instance, this billboard advertises fašnik in Samobor, a town
close to Zagreb:
(Pay attention how Samobor is transformed into the relational adjective
samoborski). Meanwhile, this poster announces pust in Matulji, a small town close
to Rijeka:
(The poster is in the local dialect of Matulji and generally surroundings of Rijeka; e.g.
instead of u¨, the preposition is va¨, some case endings are different, etc. The term
pust is also used in Slovenia.)
This custom varies in different parts of Croatia, its barely present in some parts (e.g.
Slavonia), while in other parts (esp. northern part of the coast) it’s a major tradition
and a great celebration.

________
® In Serbia, and parts of Bosnia where there’s a majority of Serbs, religious holidays
are celebrated on different dates, according to the tradition of the Serbian
Orthodox Church.
In Bosnia, esp. in parts with a large Muslim population, additional holidays, usually
known as Bajram are celebrated according to Muslim traditions.
Carnival traditions are uncommon in Bosnia and Serbia.

90 Number-like Words
There are several types of compound words derived from numbers.
The first type are derived adjectives of form number + measure. English examples
would be 10-inch or four-year. In Croatian, they are spelled without a hyphen – in
the standard spelling, at least – and the second part must be a (relational) adjective.
The first part is derived from the ‘compounding forms’ of numbers:
‘Compounding’ number forms
1- jedno-
2- dvo-
3- tro-
4- četvero-
5- peto-
6- šesto-
7- sedmo-
8- osmo-
9- deveto-
10- deseto-
11- jedanaesto-
12- dvanaesto-
20- dvadeseto-
100- sto-
200- dvjesto-
1000- tisuću-
 
many više-
For example:
trodnevni three-day
četverogodišnji four-year
četrdesetogodišnji forty-year
The linking vowel (-o- in most forms) appended to create the compound form is lost
in rare cases when an adjective begins with a vowel; it’s not lost if the vowel is a
part of the original number:
desetinčni 10-inch
stoinčni 100-inch
Despite being spelled as one word, they often pronounced with two places of stress,
one on the number, another on the adjective. (You will occasionally see such
adjectives in a non-standard spelling, as two words, or even with a hyphen, e.g.
deset-inčni and deset inčni)
They are used as any other adjective:
Sutra počinje trodnevni festival.N A three-day festival begins tomorrow.
Bili smo na dvotjednom odmoruDL. We were on two-week vacation.
(Observe also placing of the indefinite subject after the verb.)
With forms derived from numbers based on 10 (10, 20, 50, etc.) you’ll sometimes
see forms without the vowel -o-, that is pedesetgodišnji besides usual
pedesetogodišnji. You will also see non-standard forms derived from numbers 5, 6
and 7, like ones for 4, that is:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 90 Number-like Words
491 / 600

dovesti past-f
(all colloq.)
5- petero-
6- šestero-
 
7- sedmero-
8- osmero-
When such adjectives – derived from relative adjectives of time periods – are used
with people and animals, they mean three-year-old, forty-year-old, etc. For
example:
Dovela je šestogodišnjeg sinaA. She brought her six-year-old son.
Note that the words derived from šesto- can mean both 6- and 600-; therefore,
some people write compounds derived from 600- as šeststo-. In real life, confusion
is rare – there are very few 600-year-olds around.
The second type uses suffix -ak to create numbers (not adjectives!) that correspond
to English -odd. They are formed only from ‘round’ numbers, such as:
desetak ten-odd
dvadesetak twenty-odd
stotinjak hundred-odd
Such numbers behave like 10, 20 and 100 – i.e. like quantity adverbs – G-pl is used
with them, and the whole phrase behaves as neuter singular:
Desetak ljudiG je na plažiDL. Ten-odd people are on the beach.
The third type are nouns derived from smaller numbers using -ica and -ka (the
derivation is not regular, forms must be remembered):
1 → jedinica
2 → dvojka
3 → trojka
4 → četvorka
5 → petica
6 → šestica
7 → sedmica
8 → osmica
9 → devetka
10 → desetka
They mean e.g. ‘digit two’, or colloquially, something with the number on it, e.g. a
playing card, bus or tram – depending on the context:
Čekat ću šesticuA. (colloq.) I’ll wait for a number 6 tram.
However nouns derived from 1, 3 and 4 have special meanings as well:
jedinica unit
trojka three-person team
četvorka four-person team
(English sometimes uses a noun for the three-person team, taken from Russian:
troika. You see it’s almost identical to Croatian.)
For two-person teams (and other two-item groups), the common word is par pair.
The fourth type are nouns for ‘x-year-olds’ (i.e. boys/girls, men/women, but
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 90 Number-like Words
492 / 600

occasionally other animals, even some products). They are derived from the
‘compounding forms’ with appended godišnji by further appending -njak (m) and -
njakinja (f). As with the most other male/female pairs, the male form is also
generic/default:
ČetverogodišnjaciN vole trčati. Four-year-olds like to run. (i.e. Four-year-old kids)
The fifth type are compound adjectives and adverbs derived with -struk, standing for
multiplicity:
Multiplicity adjectives
jednostruk
one-fold, single-layer
dvostruk
dupli (colloq.)
double
trostruk
triple
četverostruk
fourfold
peterostruk
5-fold
šesterostruk
6-fold
...
...
deseterostruk
10-fold
...
...
dvadeseterostruk
20-fold
stostruk
100-fold
mnogostruk
višestruk
multiple, manifold
As you can see, they are derived from numbers in a specific way – from
‘compounding forms’, but for numbers 5 and over, there’s extra -ero- inserted
between the ‘compounding form’ and the suffix -struk. While all these words are
really used, some, like jedanaesterostruk 11-fold are very rare. All these words are
adjectives, for example:
Razgovarali smo s trostrukim prvacima EuropeI. We talked to three-time European
champions. (lit. ‘triple champions of Europe’)
The adjectives mnogostruk and višestruk are very common.
All these adjectives, in neuter form, are used as adverbs too, so you can tell how
many times something is better:
Novi mobitelN je dvostruko boljiN. The new cellphone is twice better.
Novi mobitelN je duplo boljiN. (colloq., the same meaning)
Instead of dvostruk, the colloquial word dupli is very common in speech.

91 Taboo Words and Expressions
This chapter uses words and expressions
some people might consider offensive.
There are several words that are often heard, but they are considered taboo outside
younger people, when communication with their friends; they refer to sexual organs
and sex. The most important verb is:
jebati (jebe) fuсk
Take care: this verb is considered extremely impolite and vulgar in most
circumstances. This verb is actually rarely used in its literal meaning.
Its pass. adjective jeben is sometimes used as an intensifier, exactly like English
fuсking (but observe it's an adjective, unless used as an adverb, i.e. you have to
change its case, gender etc.):
Taj mobitelN je jebeno skupN. That mobile phone is fuсking expensive.
There are two quite common phrases with this verb, something like ‘emoticon-
words’ (sometimes seen in abbreviation in colloquial writing, e.g. on Internet
forums):
jebo te / jebote (abbr. jbt) = amazement
jebi ga / jebiga (abbr. jbg) = resignation
The most common verb pair derived from this verb is:
zajebavati («) ~ zajebati (zajebe) screw up
This verb is considered much less vulgar than the verb it's derived from, and you can
even hear it in less formal meetings at work.
With an optional object in A, this verb corresponds to English make mistake, spoil:
Zajebao sam. I've screwed up.
However, it's more common to use this pair with se². There are two meanings then.
First, it's make a mistake, such that affects the subject. Next, the impf. verb with se²
has the additional meaning screw around.
This is the most important impolite/vulgar noun:
kuraс (kurс-) penis, diсk
Besides its obvious meaning, it's often used in a number of very colloquial (but
considered nevertheless vulgar!) expressions with completely unexpected meanings:
boljeti (boli,...) + A + kuraс (kurс-) don't give a fuсk
This, of course, literally means someone's diсk hurts, but it's a metaphor. For
example:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 91 Taboo Words and Expressions
494 / 600

3m/n
ići
p
Boli gaA kuraсN. (vulgar!) He doesn't give a fuсk.
Since this is a metaphor, you'll often hear women using that expression too for
themselves.
Next, kuraс (kurс-) can be used as a metaphorical destination or location, which
describes that something is failing completely, or is in a very bad shape, kind of
similar to English hell, but considered much more vulgar:
SveN ide u kuraсA. (vulgar!) Everything is going to hell.
IvanN je u kurсuDL. (vulgar!) Ivan is in a very bad shape.
Since the word kuraс (kurс-) is quite a taboo, it's often replaced in such
metaphorical locations and destinations with banana (I hope you get a shape-based
metaphor):
DržavaN je u bananiDL. (colloq.) The country is in a very bad shape.
The statement is no longer considered vulgar, merely colloquial, so you can hear it
on TV.
Then, it's used in very colloquial communication as a replacement for thing.
(the rest is coming soon)
• Something Possibly Interesting
Although all words derived from jebati (jebe) fuсk are taboo in some degree, you
will hear a pop song playing in large supermarkets on Sunday morning with
zajebavat clearly audible, and nobody will get offended. Editing songs and movies is
seen in Croatia as destroying integrity of a piece of art, and censorship is virtually
never done.
The choice of songs played in Croatian supermarkets is very wide – from current
Croatian and international hits to alternative all-time favorites like Love Will Tear Us
Apart. Unfortunately, I've never heard iieee.

93 Fine Points of Verb Aspect
I’ve introduced the verb aspect many chapters ago, and explained some details in
later chapters. This chapter will wrap up all the missing parts.
First, some impf. verbs have special perf. verbs that are sometimes called
‘delimitative’. They are hard to exactly translate to English, but the idea is there was
some action or state for some time, or space, not less.
For example, you have to go to work and work there for 8 hours. You can simply
say:
Radio sam osam satiG. I worked for eight hours.
However, you call also stress that you’ve fulfilled your duty for that day, by using a
derived perfective verb odraditi («); nothing else is changed:
Odradio sam osam satiG. I worked for eight hours. (focus on the time)
This verb sometimes corresponds to English work off or put in (hours), but there’s no
single English construction which has the exact meaning.
Such verbs always start with od- or ot- and are especially used when you fulfill a
duty, or what you did is taken off from a bigger requirement (e.g. you have to work
40 hours a week, you did 8 today, 32 to go).
Such verbs are an exception from the general rule that you can’t specify how long
with a perfective verb. In fact, with many such verbs, you have to specify the
duration, because this is the whole point of such verbs.
Another common such verb is:
odspavati («) perf. sleep for a time
For example, you can say:
Odspavala sam deset satiG. I slept for ten hours. (focus on the time)
The time doesn’t have to be precise, you can say that you slept for a few hours.

99 Aorist Tense and Other Marginal Features
There are features in Croatian that you will see used from time to time. You don't
need them in everyday life, but some people use them, and you'll see them in
literature (but they are rare even in books).
First, there are several rarely used verb tenses.
The aorist tense is traditionally a past tense, but today it's usually used for events
that have happened moments ago, or are about to happen right now. It's usually
formed for perfective verbs, but it can be used with impf. verbs as well.
The aorist tense is a single word, usually formed from the infinitive. For verbs ending
in -ti, the ending is replaced with the following personal endings:
person
sing.
plur.
1st
-h
-smo
2nd
-
-ste
3rd
-
-še
I'll use abbreviations like aor-1, aor-3pl for various aorist forms, in the same way as
for the present tense forms. Here are forms for several verbs (pres-3 and past forms
are not shown, as they're not important for forming the aorist if verbs have -ti in
inf):
naučiti perf. learn → aor-1 naučih
pozvati perf. call, invite → aor-1 pozvah
uzeti perf. take → aor-1 uzeh
vidjeti see → aor-1 vidjeh
Observe that it's not important if the verb is ‘regular’ or not: only the inf ending
matters.
For 2nd and 3rd person in singular, the ending is ‘empty’, so we get nauči and uze.
Verbs with inf ending in -sti and -ći insert a vowel before the aorist endings, -o- in
aor-1 and plural, and -e- in aor-23 (the form common to the 2nd and 3rd person):
person
sing.
plur.
1st
-oh
-osmo
2nd
-e
-oste
3rd
-e
-oše
For such verbs, aorist forms aren't derived from inf. If they have past-m in -ao, it's
removed, and aorist forms are derived from it; otherwise, they are derived from
pres-3, after discarding the final vowel (which is always -e for such verbs):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 99 Aorist Tense and Other Marginal Features
497 / 600

pojesti (pojede, pojeo) perf. eat → aor-1 pojedoh
reći (reče, rekao, rekla) perf. say → aor-1 rekoh
Verbs on -ći that have past-m in -kao or -gao shift the final consonant in aor-23 to
the consonant used in pres-3:
aor-1 rekoh (past-m rekao)
aor-23 reče (pres-3 reče)
Verbs derived from ići don't fit into this scheme: their aorist forms are always
derived from pres-3 (but they're quite irregular anyway):
naći (nađe, našao, našla) perf. find → aor-1 nađoh
otići (ode, otišao, otišla) perf. leave → aor-1 odoh
The aorist forms are normally stressed like forms they're derived from: if they are
derived from inf, on the same syllable as inf; if from pres-3, like it, etc.
However, in the standard stress scheme, aor-23 is always stressed on the first
syllable, regardless of stress of other forms:
aor-1
pojedoh
aor-23
pojede
aor-1pl
pojedosmo
...
The use of aorist is very rare in western parts of Croatia; in more eastern regions, it
can be heard in storytelling and expressing immediate action, e.g.:
Ja odoh. I'm leaving now.
Another past form (similar to the plusquamperfect tense) is the past conditional. It's
like conditional, but has an extra past form of the verb biti (je² +), in the same
gender and number as the other past form:
Gledala bih film. I would watch the movie. (fem. speaking)
Bila bih gledala film. I would have watched the movie.
This form was used to express intentions and opportunities in the past, but today it's
optional, and almost everybody uses just the common conditional.
Then, there's yet another past tense: the imperfect tense. As its name says, it's
formed from impf. verbs. It's so rare that I don't recall its endings. I think I've never
used it in my life. If you are really want to learn its endings, look into Wikipedia.
Similar to present adverbs derived from verbs, there are also past adverbs. They
correspond to English having seen it, she decided to.... They are normally formed
from the past-f form of the verb, replacing the final -la with -vši:
see vidjela → vidjevši
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 99 Aorist Tense and Other Marginal Features
498 / 600

eat (perf.) pojela → pojevši
For verbs where past-m form has an additional -a- in comparison to the past-f form,
it's derived from the past-m form, replacing -o with -vši:
can mogao m, mogla f → mogavši
grow up (perf.) odrastao m, odrasla f → odrastavši
They are very rare in speech, and rarely used in writing:
Vidjevši da neće uspjeti, odustala je. Having seen she wasn't going to succeed, she
gave up.
This meaning is usually expressed with kad when or nakon after instead of this rare
form.
However, the past adverb bivši, derived from the verb biti (je² +) be is often used,
but it's true adjective, with the meaning former, ex:
Vidjela je bivšeg muža. She saw her ex-husband.
As in English, the adjective bivši is used colloquially on its own, meaning ex-
husband/boyfriend, or ex-wife/girlfriend, depending on the gender, but it still
changes like an adjective.
There's an interesting feature that was historically much more common: use of
indefinite adjectives. So far, I've explained only so-called definite adjectives, which
are usually used.
However, most adjectives also had indefinite forms. They could have different stress
and case endings. I won't go into details of stress, but the endings in singular are:
gender
N
A
DL
G
I
neuter
-o
(-e)
= N
-u
-a
-om
(-em)
masc.
(not p/a) dict.
= N
masc.
(p/a)
dict.
-a
As you can see, these look exactly like the noun endings.
Standard Croatian still insists on use of indefinite adjectives. They should be used
with indefinite nouns, i.e. when you would use the indefinite article in English:
Vidim crna konja. A see a black horse. (very rare in use)
Then, some adjectives, according to Standard Croatian, have only indefinite forms,
regardless of definiteness, and that includes all possessives in -ov or -ev, including
njegov his:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / 99 Aorist Tense and Other Marginal Features
499 / 600

Vidim njegova brata. I see his brother. (Standard, but very rare)
Vidim njegovog brata. (this is almost always used)
However, you'll see forms like above in some newspapers, on TV news, and in
poetry.
Then, Standard Croatian insists that numbers 2-4 change according to case. You will
sometimes see in writing DLI forms for numbers 2 and both in feminine gender and
for 3:
number
DLI
obje f both
objema
dvije f two
dvjema
tri three
trima
If numbers change, nouns also change, into DLI-pl. For example:
Posjet dvjema farmama A visit to two farms (rare)
(If you check Google™, u dvije is about 30 times more frequent than u dvjema.)
Other forms – including masc. gender – exist in grammar books, but are very rare in
use. You will sometimes see the forms above used for G as well.

A1 Nouns and Adjectives
Here's a summary of case forms for nouns and adjectives. Some cases are marked
with an asterisk (*) meaning there is an explanation below the table.
This is the pattern for nouns in singular. The endings -a, -o, -e from nominative are
replaced with other case endings, except where it's indicated that an ending is added
to the nominative form (N +):
noun type (N)
A
DL
I
G
-a (≈ fem.)
-u
*-i -om
-e
neut. (≈ -o, -e)
= N
-u
N + m
-a
not
in
-a
masc. not p/a
= N
-u
-om
(-em)
-a
masc. p/a
-a
fem.
= N
-i
-i
-i
The five rows above are declension types — groups of nouns having the same
endings. Since three of them are very similar (neuter and masc.), Croatian
declension is often described having three classes (e.g. I, II and III in some books).
Which group a noun belongs to is based on its gender and nominative ending:
all nouns in -a change in the same way (almost all are feminine, few are
masculine, e.g. tata Dad)
all neuter nouns change in the same way (they all end in -o or -e, but converse
doesn't hold: e.g. some nouns in -o are masculine, and don't belong to this
group)
all masculine nouns that don't end in -a (they usually end in a consonant)
belong to one of two groups, distinguished by their meaning
all feminine nouns that don't end in -a (they usually end in a consonant) belong
to the last group
Certain feminine nouns, ending in either -ka or -ga, end in DL in -ci and -zi,
respectively:
Amerika America → Americi
knjiga book → knjizi
The ending -em in the instrumental case is attached to nouns that end in a Croatian-
specific letter, e.g.:
mrav ant → mravom
konj horse → konjem
There are endings for adjectives:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A1 Nouns and Adjec!ves

gender
N
A
DL
I
G
fem.

-o (-e) = N
-om
(-em) -im
-og
(-eg)
masc. not p/a
dict.
= N
masc. p/a
-og
(-eg)
The default, dictionary form, as listed in dictionaries, usually has no endings, and is
indicated with dict. in the table. It can have an optional -i, and some adjectives have
always -i in masc. N, and they are listed so in dictionaries.
As for nouns, alternate endings that contain e instead of o in masc. and neut.
genders are attached to adjectives ending on a Croatian-specific letter:
nov new → novom
loš bad → lošem
The e-endings also apply to all comparatives, even if they don't end in a Croatian-
specific letter (e.g. širi wider).
Pay attention that alternative endings don't exist for the feminine gender.
The p/a in tables above stands for people and animals.
These are the endings for nouns in plural. The DL and I cases are identical in plural.
There's an additional complexity for masculine nouns, see remarks below:
noun type (N)
N-pl
A-pl
DLI-pl
G-pl
-a (≈ fem.)
-e
= N
-ama
*-a
neut. (≈ -o, -e) -a
= N
-ima
-a
end in
cons.
masc.
*-i
*-e
N + ma
*-a
fem.
-i
= N
N + ma
*-i
Most short (one-syllable) masc. nouns ending on a consonant have either ov or ev
inserted before the endings listed above. For some masc. nouns there's a consonant
alternation in N and DLI.
Details are described in 29 Plural of Masculine Nouns and Adjectives.
The genitive case in plural has many exceptions that get rather -i instead of -a.
Additionally, some nouns get lengthened by inserting an additional a or by using the
nominative form instead of their case-base:

Details are described in 44 Genitive Plural.
There are endings for adjectives in plural; forms for DLI and G are the same for all
genders:
gender
N-pl
A-pl
DLI-pl
G-pl
fem.
-e
= N
-im
-ih
neut.
-a
= N
masc.
-i
-e
Adjectives that end in -j in N masc. sing. cannot get an optional -i. All such adjectives
have specific meanings, e.g. taj (t-) this.
Possessive adjectives moj my, tvoj your and svoj have double forms in masc. (m)
and neuter genders in singular:
gender
N
A
DL

neut.
moje
= N
mojem(u)
mom(e)
mojeg(a)
mog(a)
mojim
m
not p/a
moj
p/a
= G
When an adjective is used as a noun or pronoun, it gets an additional -a in DLI-pl:
Na mladim ljudima svijet ostaje. The world is left to the young people.
Na mladima svijet ostaje. (the same meaning)

A3 Verbs
The dictionary form of verbs is infinitive. For a great majority of verbs, past forms
can be simply derived from the infinitive. Another very important form is the 3rd
pers. present singular (pres-3), the form to derive all other present forms from
(except for three irregular verbs).
Based on their endings in infinitive and pres-3, verb are divided into verb classes.
Various textbooks use different divisions. The division presented here is useful for
someone learning Croatian as a foreign language.
Present tense forms
All forms of the present tense have always the same endings (except for three
irregular verbs) – only the pres-3pl depends on the vowel pres-3 ends in:
pres-1
-a-m
-i-m
-e-m
pres-2
-a-š
-i-š
-e-š
pres-3
-a
-i
-e
pres-1pl
-a-mo
-i-mo
-e-mo
pres-2pl
-a-te
-i-te
-e-te
pres-3pl
-aju
-e
-u
Two verbs have (fully regular) present forms only:
(bude) perf. be, get, become
(veli) say
While (bude) is one of most important verbs in Croatian, the verb (veli) is often used
only in certain regions.
Aorist forms
The aorist tense is not frequently used. It's a past tense, sometimes used for events
that are about to happen right now. Usually it's formed for perfective verbs, but it
can be used with imperfective verbs as well. Its forms are:
aor-1
-h
-o-h
aor-23
-
-e
aor-1pl
-smo
-o-smo
aor-2pl
-ste
-o-ste
aor-3pl
-še
-o-še
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A3 Verbs
504 / 600

The endings with a vowel (-o-h, etc.) are used only with verbs that have infinitives
ending in -sti or -ći. For all other verbs, the aorist forms are simply formed from the
infinitive by discarding -ti and adding aorist endings:
inf
aor-1
naučiti perf. learn
naučih
uzeti perf. take
uzeh
pojesti perf. eat
pojedoh
For more information about forming the aorist tense for verbs in -sti or -ći, check
With possible sound shifts in infinitive and present below.
Simple verb classes
These are the easiest verb classes:
  inf
pres-3
past-m
a
-a-ti
-a
-a-o
i
-i-ti
-i
-i-o
n
-nu-ti
-n-e
-nu-o
ova/uje
-ova-ti
-uj-e
-ova-o
Two out of four classes are completely determined by their infinitive form: all verbs
with infinitives in -nuti belong to the n-verbs, and all verbs with infinitives in -ovati
belong to ova/uje-verbs.
Unfortunately, it doesn't hold for verbs ending in -ati or -iti: they are not all a-verbs
or i-verbs.
A great majority of verbs belong to these four verb classes. Past forms are simply
obtained from the infinitive. Unprefixed a-verbs are more or less all imperfective, as
almost all ova/uje-verbs. Virtually all n-verbs are perfective, except for the following
verbs:
brinuti worry
čeznuti yearn
ginuti perish, die
tonuti sink
trnuti numb
trunuti rot
venuti wither
The a-verbs are the default class of verbs: all new verbs that are adapted into
Croatian (mostly colloquially) are adapted as a-verbs:
četati chat (over Internet)
printati print (from a PC)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A3 Verbs
505 / 600

(It seems that in Serbia ova/uje is the default verb class.)
Unpredictable classes, without shifts
A bit more difficult classes are unpredictable, without sound shifts. You basically
have to remember both infinitive and pres-3 form; however, there are no sound
shifts. There are 7 classes in this group, divided into 2 subgroups. The first four are:
  inf
pres-3
past-m
ava/aje
-ava-ti
-aj-e
-ava-o
eva/uje
-eva-ti
-uj-e
-eva-o
iva/uje
-iva-ti
-uj-e
-iva-o
uva/uje
-uva-ti
-uj-e
-uva-o
They all have -ati in the infinitive and are overall similar to a-verbs, except for the
present forms. Three classes (ava/aje, eva/uje, uva/uje) out of the 4 above contain
only a handful of of verbs. Common ones are:
davati (daje) give
-znavati (-znaje)
carevati (caruje) rule as an emperor
kraljevati (kraljuje) rule as a king
bljuvati (bljuje) vomit
pljuvati (pljuje) spit
All verbs listed are imperfective. Of course, verbs derived by prefixing those listed
above belong to the same class, but some are perfective. Often used are ones
derived from davati (daje), e.g. do-davati (do-daje). The "verb" -znavati (-znaje) is
not used on its own, only verbs derived from it by prefixing are used, e.g. po-znavati
(po-znaje).
Unfortunately, verbs ending in -ivati can be either a-verbs – e.g. plivati, pozivati – or
iva/uje-verbs – e.g. dokazivati (dokazuje), etc. There are many iva/uje-verbs – too
much to list here.
The next three classes are a bit more complicated, as two of them have a
(predictable) alternation in the past forms. It's interesting that for some of them,
Standard forms are different from forms used in speech and casual writing most of
the time:
  inf
pres-3
past-m
past-f
a/i
-a-ti
-i
-a-o
-a-la
je/i
-je-ti
-i
-i-o
-je-la
je/ije
-je-ti
-ij-e
-i-o
-je-la
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A3 Verbs
506 / 600

Only a limited number of verbs belong to the a/i-verbs. Some of them have general,
quite basic meanings:
bježati run away
bojati paint (wall, fence) *
bojati se² be afraid
brojati count *
čučati squat
držati hold
ležati lay
klečati kneel
trčati run
spati sleep
stajati (stoji) stand
-stojati
strujati stream *
(Only infinitives are listed, pres-3 forms end in -i!) The verb stajati (stoji) stand is
irregular. This does not apply to verb derived from it, which have regular forms from
-stojati. The verb spati (spi) sleep is quite archaic, but still used in some regions
(however, verbs derived from it are common). Besides it, all a/i-verb feature
Croatian-specific consonants.
The rest of a/i-verbs in common use stand for various sounds (again, I list only
infinitives):
bečati cry (baby)
blejati bleat
brujati hum
cvrčati chirr
hučati boom
ječati cry, shrill
pištati squeak, beep
pljuštati rain heavily, shower
režati growl
šuštati rustle, murmur
vrištati scream
zujati buzz *
zvečati twang
zviždati whistle
zvučati sound
All a/i-verbs listed here are imperfective, and verbs derived from by prefixing are
also a/i-verbs, but perfective, e.g. dotrčati (dotrči), zaspati (zaspi)...
As a rule, a/i-verbs have the stress fixed on the first syllable in the present tense, i.e.
the stress doesn't shift to negation in the standard stress scheme:
bježati (bježi) run away
. . .
vrištati (vrišti) scream
. . .
The only exception is the verb spati (spi) sleep.
Four a/i-verbs above are marked with an asterisk (*). They also exist as plain i-verbs,
in fact, Standard Croatian insists on them being just plain i-verbs, although a/i
versions prevail in use:

mostly used
Std. Cro.
bojati (boji)

brojati (broji)
brojiti
strujati (struji) strujiti
zujati (zuji)
zujiti
(Google™ search of the .hr domain will show you the a/i-verb forms of these four
verbs are 3-4 times more common than the i-verb forms.)
All verbs that end in infinitive in -jeti belong to the je/i-verbs, except for the
following common verbs, which belong to the je/ije-verbs:
dospjeti (dospije, dospio, dospjela) perf. end up
razumjeti (razumije, razumio, razumjela) understand
smjeti (smije, smio, smjela) be allowed
uspjeti (uspije, uspio, uspjela) perf. succeed
However, many verbs that in Standard Croatian belong to the je/i-verbs are
reshaped as plain i-verbs in colloquial communication, even in newspapers. This
does not affect their present forms, only the infinitive and past forms. The following
verbs are seldom seen with -je- in infinitive and past, -i- forms prevail even in
newspapers (only infinitives are listed for sake of brevity, you can work out other
forms):
gnjiljeti rot
hlapjeti evaporate
starjeti age, grow old
strepjeti fear, quail
šumjeti whirr, hum
tamnjeti darken
(For example, Google™ gives 1250 hits for hlapiti on the .hr domain, but just 87 for
hlapjeti.) Therefore, don't be surprised that Standard Croatian dictionaries list only
forms starjeti, starjeli, but you hear are read just stariti and starili all the time. Of
course, this applies to all verbs derived by prefixing from the verbs above, e.g.
instead of ostarjeti you will mostly see just ostariti.
For the following common verbs, i-forms prevail in casual communication, while
je/i-forms prevail in written communication, newspapers, etc. (again, only infinitives
are listed):
gorjeti burn
grmjeti thunder
smrdjeti stink
štedjeti save (money)
šutjeti be quiet
trpjeti suffer
vrtjeti spin, turn
visjeti hang
vrvjeti swarm
žudjeti yearn
With a possible sound shift in present
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A3 Verbs
508 / 600

This is a class (or two classes, if you like it) that contains a lot of verbs. Its
characteristic is -ati in the infinitive, and e in the pres-3, with a possible sound shift.
The shift does not happen if the consonants before -ati are Croatian-specific
(usually j) or r:
  inf
pres-3
past-m
a/*e
-ja-ti
-j-e
-ja-o
-sa-ti
etc.
-š-e
etc.
-sa-o
etc.
Common verbs that fall into this class without a sound shift are:
brijati (brije) shave
češati (češe) scratch
derati (dere) tear
grijati (grije) heat
kašljati (kašlje) cough
lajati (laje) bark
orati (ore) till
penjati (penje) se² climb
sijati (sije) sow
smijati (smije) se² laugh
stajati (staje) stop, stand
stenjati (stenje) groan
trajati (traje) last
There are many common verbs with a sound shift. Here are verbs with the shift k or
c → č, e.g. skakati (skače) – only infinitives are listed for brevity:
hrkati snore
micati move
nicati sprout
plakati cry, shed tears
klicati shout, cheer
-ricati 
skakati jump
srkati sip (while eating)
urlikati scream
ticati touch
vikati yell
žvakati chew
The following verbs have change h or s → š, e.g. pisati (piše):
brisati wipe, clear
kihati sneeze
klesati chisel
kresati trim
jahati ride (animal)
mahati wave
mirisati («) smell
njihati sway, wobble
pisati write
puhati blow
sisati suck
The following verbs have change g or z → ž, e.g. rezati (reže):
kazati say, tell
klizati slide, skate
lagati lie, tell lies
lizati lick
mazati spread (on bread, skin)
pomagati help

This class is the simplest one historically, there's just -ti in infinitive and -je in pres-3:
  inf
pres-3
past-m
vowel-root
-ti
-j-e
-o
Only a limited number of verbs fall into this class:
biti (bije) beat
čuti (čuje) hear
kriti (krije) hide
piti (pije) drink
šiti (šije) sew
viti (vije) wave
The verb biti (bije) is rare in Croatia nowadays, but verbs derived from it – e.g. ubiti
(ubije) perf. kill – are common. The same holds for viti (vije). One more verb – šiti
(šije) – is archaic, šivati is much more frequent in meaning sew – but verbs derived
from it are not.
Additionally, two perfective verbs also fall into this class:
obuti (obuje) perf. put on (shoes)
umiti (umije) perf. wash (face)
With possible sound shifts in infinitive and present
This set of classes is basically the same as vowel-root, but they historically didn't
have a vowel before -ti in infinitive, so all kinds of sound assimilations happened in
the infinitive as well as in the present! Verbs belonging to this class often have
different consonants in all three main forms (infinitive, present, past). Most verbs in
this group have -ao in past-m.
It's possible to group verbs based on their (historic) final consonants. Following
classes don't have major alternations; they characteristically have -sti in the
infinitive, and their historic final consonant is revealed in present forms:

pres-3
past-m

Except for d/t-root verbs, only a handful of verbs fall into these classes. They are:
grepsti (grebe, grebao, grebla) scratch
gristi (grize, grizao, grizla) bite
musti (muze, muzao, muzla) milk
rasti (raste, rastao, rasla) grow
tresti (trese, tresao, tresla) shake, shiver
vesti (veze, vezao, vezla) embroider
-vesti (-veze, -vezao, -vezla)
The second -vesti (etc.) is a base many verbs are derived from, with the basic
meaning drive, e.g. odvesti (etc.) drive away. The verb grepsti (etc.) is rare, more
common is variant grebati (grebe). Of course, verbs are derived from the other
verbs listed above too, e.g. odrasti (etc.).
The following verbs belong to the d/t-root verbs:
bosti (bode, bo / boo, bola) stab, prod
jesti (jede, jeo, jela) eat
krasti (krade, krao, krala) steal
presti (prede, preo, prela) spin (yarn); purr
-vesti (-vede, -veo, -vela)
cvasti (cvate, cvao, cvala) blossom
mesti (mete, meo, mela) sweep
plesti (plete, pleo, plela) knit
Again, many verbs are derived from them, and the base -vesti (etc.) is used only to
derive verbs from, with the basic meaning lead.
The following class has major alternations:
  inf
pres-3
past-m
past-f
k/g-root
-ći
-č-e
-k-a-o
-k-la
This class is called k/g-root for historical reasons – there are no g-root verbs in
common use today. All alternations in various forms are shown here, with vući pull
as an example (again, the original k is seen in past-m and pres-3pl):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A3 Verbs

Such verbs are (only infinitives are listed for brevity):
obući perf. wear (clothes)
peći bake
reći perf. say
sjeći (siječe) cut
teći flow
tući beat
vući pull
Of course, there are also verbs derived from them. The verb sjeći has ije instead of
je in present forms.
Verbs in all these classes, from s-root to k/g-root have a rightward stress shift in the
present tense (in the Standard scheme) if they have at least three syllables:
odrasti (odraste)
ispeći (ispeče)
obući (obuče)
All these classes have the aor-1 in -oh, with their historic final consonants:
  inf
 
aor-1
d/t-root
pojesti
pres-3 pojede
pojed-oh
k/g-root
reći
past-m rekao
rek-oh
In aor-23, the consonant before the ending -e changes like in pres forms:
rekoh aor-1 → reče aor-23
With vowel alternation
These classes have their pres-3 different from inf/past not by change of consonants,
but vowels. They are further divided into three subclasses. The first one has
infinitive on -ati; it contains the following common verbs:
brati (bere) pick (fruits)
klati (kolje) slaughter
prati (pere) wash
srati (sere) shit (impolite!)
slati (šalje) send
zvati (zove) call
All these verbs are imperfective, verbs derived from them by prefixing are all
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A3 Verbs
512 / 600

perfective; both have have pass. adj. ending in -an (e.g. pozvan invited).
The next class has infinitives in -eti and -uti:
kleti (kune) curse
mljeti (melje) mill
žeti (žanje) rip, harvest
naduti (nadme) perf. bloat
oteti (otme) perf. hijack
uzeti (uzme) perf. take
The following roots also fall into this class; they are used to derive several important
verbs, all perfective:
-četi (-čne):
  početi (počne) perf. begin
  začeti (začne) perf. conceive
-peti (-pne):
  napeti (napne) perf. wind up
  popeti (popne) se² perf. climb
  raspeti (raspne) perf. crucify
  zapeti (zapne) perf. stumble
-suti (-spe):
  nasuti (naspe) perf. cover
  rasuti (raspe) perf. dissipate
The verbs from this class have pass. adj. obtained just by removing -i from the
infinitive (e.g. počet, napet, rasut, otet). This all also holds for verbs derived from
them by prefixing.
Finally, these two verbs are today quite archaic, but verbs derived from them are
common:
mrijeti (mre, mro) die
strijeti (stre, stro) spread
The second verb has another possible infinitive form: strti. These verbs are
imperfective; verbs derived from them by prefixing (e.g. u-mrijeti) are perfective,
and still belong to this class. To get impf. pairs of the prefixed verbs, use verbs
ending on -irati (-ire), e.g. um-irati (um-ire).
With inserted n in present
Certain verbs have present like n-verbs, but have infinitives without n, leading to all
possible sound shifts in infinitive and past forms. All such verbs are perfective.
This is the only verb in this class without sound shifts (and all verbs derived from it,
most of them very frequent!):
stati (stane) perf. stop
The following verbs behave as d/t-root in the past and infinitive:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A3 Verbs
513 / 600

pasti (padne, pao) perf. fall
sjesti (sjedne, sjeo) perf. sit
sresti (sretne, sreo) perf. encounter
The following verbs behave as k/g-root in the past and infinitive, and some of them
also appear as regular n-verbs:
-bjeći (-bjegne, -bjegao, -bjegla):
  izbjeći (izbjegne, izbjegao, izbjegla) perf. avoid
  pobjeći (pobjegne, pobjegao, pobjegla) perf. run away
leći (legne, legao, legla) perf. lie (down)
pomoći (pomogne, pomogao, pomogla) perf. help
stići (stigne, stigao, stigla) perf. arrive (on time)
dići (digne, digao, digla) perf. raise
  also dignuti (digne)
nići (nikne, nikao, nikla) perf. sprout
  also niknuti (nikne)
pući (pukne, pukao, pukla) perf. break, burst
  also puknuti (pukne)
taći (takne, takao, takla) perf. touch
  also taknuti (takne)
The root -bjeći is not used on its own, it's used to derive verbs, listed above.
Of course, all this applies also to verbs derived by prefixing from the above verbs,
e.g. po-taknuti / po-taći.
Irregular past
These verbs have past, inf and pres-3 quite different, but forms of the present tense
are normally derived from their pres-3. They are:
ići (ide, išao, išla) go
otići (ode, otišao, otišla) perf. leave
-ći (-đe, -šao, -šla)
-nijeti (-nesem, -nio, -nijela)
From the root -ći (etc.) perfective verbs of motion and naći (etc.) are derived; from -
nijeti (etc.), perfective verbs derived from bring, e.g. od-nijeti (od-nesem, od-nio,
od-nijela) perf. take away.
Irregular present
There are three verbs with specific forms in the present tense, their inf and past
forms are kind of expected. They are be, will and can:

A5 Word Order
The word order consists of two 'components':
mandatory order
non-mandatory order
Words that have mandatory order cannot be tweaked to emphasize something or
carry some information; words with non-mandatory order can be.
Non-mandatory order
The default order in sentences like Ana is watching TV is the same as in English
(SVO):
Ana gleda televiziju.
In sentences of type X is PLACE, there are two equally used word orders:
when PLACE is first, it's about PLACE and a something new (X) was introduced;
when X is first, it's about X, which is something already known.
This roughly corresponds to definiteness:
Pismo je na stolu. The letter is on the table.
Na stolu je pismo. A letter is on the table. / There's a letter on the table.
This also holds for the verb nalazi se² is found, is placed.
The same holds for sentences of type subject + verb (SV). The subject comes first if
it's something known, and comes after the verb if it's a new thing introduced:
Film počinje. ≈ The movie is starting.
Počinje film. ≈ A movie is starting.
However, the word order can be changed as well to emphasize something.
In sentences where somebody experiences something from the environment (cold,
heat, boredom) or pain, the experiencer comes first, despite not being the subject:
Ani je hladno. Ana is cold.
Anu boli noga. Ana's leg hurts.
Locations and directions usually come after verbs:
Ana ide na posao. Ana is going to work.
Živimo u Zagrebu. We live in Zagreb.
Adverbs usually come before verbs:
Ana često gleda televiziju. Ana often watches TV.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A5 Word Order
516 / 600

Ana sutra ide na posao. Ana is going to work tomorrow.
Danas idem u kino. I'm going to cinema today.
The default order of nouns with adjectives is possessive adjective - adjective - noun:
tvoja plava košulja your blue shirt
moja ljubav my love
In poetry and songs, the order can be changed:
tvoja košulja plava
ljubav moja
In the vocative case, the default order of nouns and adjectives is reversed:
ljubavi moja! o my love!
The default order or nouns with genitive attribute is noun - noun in G; it's very rarely
tweaked in poetry and songs:
kraj filma end of the movie
With counting, the most common order is possessive adjective - number - adjective -
noun:
moje dvije crvene jabuke my two red apples
Mandatory order: enclitics
All second-position words come always in predefined order, in one block:
Order of second-position words
li²
bih², bi², bismo², biste² (conditional verb)
sam², si², smo², ste², su² (all except je²)
ću², ćeš², će², ćemo², ćete²
mi², ti²,... (pronouns in DL)
me², te²,... (pronouns in A and G)
se²
je² (usually left out if se² is present)
Before second-position words, there's one or more words in the "first position".
Words like i¨, ni¨ and a¨ (which all translate as and), prepositions (e.g. u¨, na¨, pod¨,
etc.) and the negative particle ne¨ don't "count", and cannot fill the first position on
their own:
Gladan sam. I'm hungry.
I ja sam gladan. I'm hungry too.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A5 Word Order
517 / 600

Two or more words that count, if they form a "phrase", can together occupy the
first position:
Moj prijatelj je ovdje. My friend is here.
These "phrases" are absolutely never split:
Hold the 1st position: never split
preposition + word
U sobi je hladno. 
  It's cold in the room.
ne¨ + verb
Ne bojim se.
  I'm not afraid.
These "phrases", where one noun is described by another, are very rarely split:
Hold the 1st position: very rarely split
noun + za¨ + noun in A
Četka za kosu je u ladici. 
  The hairbrush is in the drawer.
noun + na¨ + noun in A
Igračke na baterije su jeftine. 
  Battery-powered toys are cheap.
noun + od¨ + noun in G
Sok od naranče je u frižideru. 
  The orange juice is in the fridge.
noun + noun in G
Kraj filma je glup. 
  The end of the movie is stupid.
These "phrases" are very rarely split in speech, but you can see them split in formal
writing:
Hold the 1st position: split in formal writing
adjective(s) + noun
Moj stari prijatelj je ovdje. 
  My old friend is here.
preposition + 
adjective(s) + noun
U mojoj sobi je hladno. 
  It's cold in my room.
names
Ivana Horvat je ovdje.
  Ivana Horvat is here.
time expressions
Godina dana je prošla.
  A year passed.
Standard Croatian manuals often suggest breaking down such phrases and placing
the second-position words mechanically; this is very rare in speech (except on Public
Radio and TV):
Moj je prijatelj ovdje. (formal)
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A5 Word Order
518 / 600

U mojoj je sobi hladno. (formal)
Names are rarely split even in formal writing, but you can see it sometimes:
Ivana je Horvat ovdje. (very rare)
These "phrases" can hold the 1st position, but are sometimes split even in everyday
speech:
Hold the 1st position: splitting is optional
intensity adverb + adverb
Jako dugo je čekala.
  She waited for a very long time.
number + noun
Troje ljudi te čeka.
  Three people are waiting for you.
quantity + noun
Puno ljudi te čeka.
  A lot people are waiting for you.
baš absolutely
skoro almost
+
adverb
Skoro uvijek je hladno.
  It's cold almost always.
pronoun/
adjective
Baš svi su ovdje.
  Absolutely everybody is here.
Other combinations cannot form such "phrases". For example, opet again + verb is
not such a phrase, and it cannot hold the 1st position:
Opet se igra. He/she is playing again.
Word order in clauses
Clauses have their own second position; if they start with a conjunction (e.g. jer in
the following example), any second-position words come right after it:
Trava¹ je² mokra [jer¹ je² padala kiša]. The grass is wet because it has rained.
Sometimes, short time adverbs – such as sad(a) now, još still and već already – are
placed immediately after jer, second position words come after the adverb. For
example:
Ne želim knjiguA [jer¹ već¹ sam ju² pročitao]. I don’t want the book [because I’ve
already read it].
The same can happen with stressed pronouns (e.g. meni).
This quite rare.

A7 Stress (u/c)
This chapter uses specific stress symbols,
different than in the rest of Easy Croatian.
I will give you an overview of stress in Croatian, both Standard Croatian, non-
standard and in closely related languages. Everything that follows applies to
Standard Croatian and Standard Bosnian and Standard Serbian unless otherwise is
explicitly stated.
General Issues
First, in the Standard Croatian, each vowel can be either short or long. There can be
more than one long vowel in one word. I will mark the vowels as:
Vowel length
short vowel
a
long vowel
ā
This holds also for "vocalic" r: there's long r̄ ; however I will mark it as ŕ, since just a
line over r is, unfortunately, not rendered right in some browsers and mobile
phones.
The stress can be either falling or rising. The falling stress has a tone that's audibly
first high and then falling and staying low. Since the stressed vowel can be either
short or long, there are 4 combinations – the 4 classic "accents" as described in the
19th century:
  short vowel
  long vowel
falling
stress
          ri -   ba
          sūn   -   ce
rising
stress
          vo - da
          rū     -     ka
I have introduced here the following, special, non-standard markings:
if only one vowel is underlined, it's the stressed vowel with the falling
intonation;
if two vowels are underlined, one after another, the first of them is the
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A7 Stress (u/c)
520 / 600

stressed vowel with the rising intonation;
as a special case, if no vowels are underlined, the first vowel is stressed with
the falling intonation (you'll see the reason a bit later).
(There are also standard stress markings in Croatian. However, these markings are
not really transparent, so in certain books and linguistic works, alternative marks are
often used.)
Now, most textbooks (including the schoolbooks in Croatia) mention two classic
rules that restrict the place of stress:
#1 the falling intonation can appear only on the first syllable;
#2 the rising intonation cannot appear on the last syllable (therefore it cannot
appear at all in one-syllable words).
Now, the restriction #2 is actually obvious from my notation: you have to underline
two vowels, therefore, you need a word with at least two vowels! There's no way to
set a rising stress on the last vowel – only the first vowel you underlined will be
stressed.
However, the restriction #1 is not obvious, and it's actually not always respected in
real life, even in areas where people use stress very close to the standard at home
(enter non-initial falling tones into Google™).
This all so far is only the introduction to real issues. The main feature of stress in
Standard Croatian is that it changes in various forms of one word. Moreover, the
vowel length changes in some forms! For example, the word lonac pot has all
possible alternations (rising vs. falling, short vs. long vowel):
sing.
plur.
N
lonac
lōnci
G
lōnca
lonācā
On the other hand, there are words that have the same stress in all forms. To make
it even more complex, stress sometimes shift to prepositions.
Noun Stress
However, there's an underlying system, bizarre but regular. Let's first visit the noun
stress: nouns are basically divided into three groups. Let's first see how the a-nouns
(nouns ending in -a in N) behave:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A7 Stress (u/c)
521 / 600

"A"
"B"
"C"
N
riba
žena
voda
DL
ribi
ženi
vodi
G
ribē
ženē
vodē
A
u-
ribu 
ribu
u-
ženu 
ženu
u-
vodu 
vodu
V
ribo
ženo
vodo
NA-pl
ribe
žene
vode
We see one thing all nouns have in common: the vocative case has the "automatic"
falling stress – no vowels are underlined. Another thing that's not obvious from the
usual spelling – the case ending in G is a long e.
The nouns in the group "B" are boring: the stress stays on the same syllable and is
same in all forms (except in the vocative, but that's a special form anyway).
The group "A" gets interesting when an unstressed preposition (e.g. u) is placed
before the noun: the stress "spreads" to it, i.e. moves one syllable to the left, but
gets the rising intonation.
This stress shift we still see in such nouns is called Neoštokavian stress shift. It's the
origin of the rising intonation in the Standard Croatian: whenever (well... almost
whenever) there was another syllable before the stressed syllable with the falling
intonation, the stress moved left, and changed the intonation. It also happened
centuries ago to nouns like žena. There are still regions in Croatia where that noun
keeps the older stress, žena (we are sure that stress is older because such nouns in
Russian have the stress at the "old" position as well).
This is why a rising stress cannot appear on the last syllable – there have to be one
syllable after it, one that had the original (falling) stress. We can simply show what
has happened and what still happens:
Neoštokavian stress shift
centuries ago
žena → žena
we see today
po + ribu → po-ribu
Such stresses are called 'new' (this is relative: they are centuries old), hence the neo-
in Neoštokavian.
This shift happens only to falling stresses. They were transformed almost always
when they were not on the first syllable – this is the reason for the classic rule #1.
Now, we examine the nouns in the group "C". They are completely unlike "A" or "B"
nouns: their stress varies according to noun case. In the accusative case, if there's
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A7 Stress (u/c)
522 / 600

an unstressed preposition before the noun, the stress again shifts to it, but it's still
falling. In fact, it shifts as leftward as it can:
vodu
u-vodu
i-u-vodu
Such shift is the reason for my "special case" notation – when no vowels are
underlined, as in A and N-pl of "C" nouns – there's a falling intonation stress on the
very first syllable, including all unstressed words before the noun that are
pronounced together with it.
There's no way to tell which nouns are in the group "C" just by looking at them in the
nominative – they must be remembered. Textbooks say there's about 60 such a-
nouns. The common ones are:
daska plank
grāna branch
grēda wooden beam
igla needle
kosa hair (on scalp)
metla broom
ovca sheep
pčela bee
pēta heel
rosa dew
srijēda Wednesday
strijēla arrow
sŕna fem. roe deer
stijēna rock
strāna side
vōjska army
zora dawn
zīma winter
zvijēzda star
The nouns above have the strange "automatic" falling stress only in A. However, a
couple of common nouns can have such stress in DL as well:
dūša soul
glāva head
noga leg
rūka arm/hand
voda water
zemlja ground, country, Earth

A8 Dialects
This chapter uses specific stress symbols,
different than in the rest of Easy Croatian.
(This chapter is under construction.)
I'll give a brief overview of dialects in Croatia and neighboring countries.
Croatia belongs to the South Slavic language area, and to the wider Slavic area. Both
these areas are essentially dialect continua, that is, areas where any dialect is similar
to the dialect next to it, which is similar to the one next to it, and so on: difference
between dialects increases with distance, and there are very few sharp dialect
borders.
Many features of South Slavic dialects change roughly in the northwest-southeast
direction, represented by the arrow in this map:
(The arrow should go, and does go further into Macedonia and Bulgaria, but I will
concentrate on dialects in Croatia and countries next to it.)
Going in the direction of the arrow (i.e. to the south-east), features change in this
way:
• There are fewer noun forms (that is, different case endings). In Slovenia, nouns
have singular, dual and plural forms, and 6 cases with different endings in plural. In
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A8 Dialects
524 / 600

the area around Niš, Serbia, there is only singular and plural, and only two cases (N
and A). In Macedonia, nouns have no cases! This doesn't apply to the vocative
case, though.
• There are more verb tenses in use. In the western parts of Croatia, the aorist tense
is very rarely used. It doesn't exist at all in Slovenia. In Serbia, it's used every day in
speech. When you reach Macedonia, there are 9 tenses.
• Infinitives are less used and finally disappear in South of Serbia, where only da +
present is used.
• Vocatives are more often used – in western parts of Croatia, vocatives are rare, N
is used when calling someone. In Bosnia and Serbia, they are frequently used.
• There are more Greek and Turkish loan words further you go to the south-east.
There are couple of forms that are specific for ‘west’ and ‘east’:
 
‘west’
‘east’
you can
moreš
možeš
four men/boys
četvero
četvoro
Each feature splits the area at a different line. Standard Croatian has the ‘eastern’
možeš, but the ‘western’ četvero.
Furthermore, there's something interesting: most dialectal variation is in the
northwest. In the central and southeastern areas, there's less dialects on the same
land area. (That's due to history.) It's obvious from this simplified and not-too-
accurate dialect map, showing the dialects in villages in middle 20th century (click on
the image to enlarge):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A8 Dialects
525 / 600

Dialects are marked with the following two-letter abbreviations, here grouped into
traditional dialect groups (the usual term in Croatian is narječje):
‘Slovene’: CR - Carinthian, ST - Styrian, PA - Pannonian, UC - Upper Carniolan, LC -
Lower Carniolan, RV - Rovte, LI - Littoral;
‘Kajkavian’: ZM - Zagorje-Međimurje, TP - Turopolje-Posavina, KP - Križevci-
Podravina, PR - Prigorje;
‘Čakavian’: NČ - Northwestern Čakavian, CČ - Central Čakavian, SČ - Southeastern
Čakavian;
‘Štokavian’: SL - Slavonian, WI - Western Ikavian, HK - Herzegovina-Krajina (East
Herzegovinian), EB - East Bosnian, ŠV - Šumadija-Vojvodina, SM - Smederevo-Vršac,
ZS - Zeta-Sandžak, KR - Kosovo-Resava;
‘Torlak’: PM - Prizren-South Morava, TL - Timok-Lužnica.
There are other ways to divide dialects: for example, the classification of ‘Čakavian’
dialects shown here is after Dutch linguist Willem Vermeer; you'll find other ways to
classify them in many books. Some dialects shown here together are usually shown
separately – even if they are quite alike neighboring ones – for traditional (and
political) reasons (e.g. Lower Carniolan dialects in Croatia are usually shown
separately as ‘goranski’, etc.
The grouping of dialects into ‘Kajkavian’, ‘Čakavian’ and ‘Štokavian’ is usually
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A8 Dialects
526 / 600

presented as something fundamental. However, it's not really so: for example,
Northwestern Čakavian dialects have a lot of similarities with the Littoral dialects in
Slovenia; ‘Kajkavian’ Zagorje-Međimurje dialects have many similarities with
Pannonian dialects in Slovenia; ‘Torlak’ dialects are often grouped with ‘Štokavian’,
but they have many similarities with dialects in Macedonia and Bulgaria as well;
there's no sharp border between Southeastern Čakavian and ‘Štokavian’ Western
Ikavian; ‘Štokavian’ Slavonian dialects have similarities with ‘Čakavian’ dialects, etc.
The Origin of Dialects
Western South Slavic Dialects differ in many ways, one of them is development of
old vowels. Western South Slavic, some 1000 years ago, had the following vowels
(the situation was different in Eastern South Slavic, i.e. today Macedonia and
Bulgaria), and all of them could be either short or long:
i                   u
ě     ə     ö
e ë    o 
a
  l   r
To mark long vowels, in descriptions of old, reconstructed forms, and in brief
descriptions of various dialects, I’ll just write them double, e.g. aa or ee. For
instance sun was sllnce and hand was rööka.
Developments of the old vowels ě and ə – often called yat and yer – are most
obvious to the majority of speakers. Actually, ‘Ijekavian’, ‘Ikavian’ and ‘Ekavian’ are
just different developments of the vowel ě (yat).
The vowels ë and ö were nasal, like in today French or Portuguese.
There were also two specific consonants, usually labelled as d' and t'. They were
palatal (softened) d and t. The verb doći (dođe) was earlier dojti (dojde); in some
dialects, jt and jd have later changed.
(I'm using slightly specific symbols here; usually, in specialized literature, ę and ǫ are
used instead of my ë and ö. Unfortunately, they are not displayed properly on some
mobile phones and e-book readers. Also, ḷ and ṛ are usually used instead of l and r.
Neither symbols are compatible with the IPA notation).
Then, we need marks for various types of stress. I’ll use the following marks for
stress and tones within one syllable:
a
short, stressed
aa
long stressed vowel with a falling tone
aa
long stressed vowel with a rising/flat tone
The tone I mark as aa is also called ‘neoacute’; it doesn’t exist in Standard Croatian.
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A8 Dialects
527 / 600

And finally, I’ll use the following marks for two-syllable tones, where the stressed
syllable has another syllable with the high tone that follows it:
a...a
short stressed
+ a high tone following it
aa...a
long stressed
This can be summarized simply: the first underscored vowel is stressed, the
underscores mark high tones.
If you are going to read any dialectological works, you’ll see the standard ‘accent
marks’. Unfortunately, they are not rendered well on some mobile phones and e-
book readers, they are difficult to distinguish at small font sizes, and, finally, they are
quite counter-intuitive. Here's how my marks translate to the standard ones (the
diacritics are also shown in brackets):
aa = ā (–)
a = ȁ (\\)
aa = ȃ (^) 
aa = ã (~)
a...a = à...a (\)
aa...a = á...a (/)
Therefore, what I write as e.g. öö is in most linguistic works written as ǫ with-a-
tilde-above.
Stress systems in various dialects have the origin in the old system, reconstructed for
the old West South Slavic, for the period od some 1000 years ago, where there were
at least 2 tones on the syllables. The stress could have been on any syllable, and
unstressed syllables could be also short or long. The reconstructed forms of some
words are:
mlěěko milk
rööka hand
větər wind
kljuuč key (G kljuuča)
sestra sister (G-pl sestəər)
žena woman, wife (A ženö)
(It's possible to reconstruct even earlier forms – in many cases, thousands years
earlier – but they aren't important here.)
‘Kajkavian’ (Zagorje-Međimurje)
An example ‘Kajkavian’ dialect is the speech of Konjščina, with a detailed description
by Vedrana Gudek, available online.
The first impression anyone has about ‘Kajkavian’ are specific vowels. While there
are only 5 vowels in e.g. Zagreb, the traditional speech of Konjščina has many more:

long/diphtongs

ε
u
 
o
a
 
ii
ie   ee 
 
εε
uu
uo   ou
oo
aa
The vowel ε – a kind of ‘open e’, like in English bad or German ä – is the
characteristic vowel for ‘Kajkavian’. Unfortunately, it’s usually written just as e:
there's no proper orthography for it (dialectologists usually use ȩ, which is not visible
on all devices, or sometimes æ).
Vowels ie, uo, ou are diphtongs, similar to English ow in low, how, but the i's and u's
in them are, unlike in English, pronounced very quickly, they are very short, so I could
have written them also as ie, uo, ou.
Unfortunately, long vowels ii, εε are too usually written just with i and e. Here are a
couple of words with various vowels:
dietε child (djete, usually spelled dijete)
mεεse meat (meso)
rouka hand (ruka)
suonce sun (sunce)
(For comparison, forms spoken in Zagreb are given in brackets).
In ‘Kajkavian’ (and in dialects in Slovenia) there's one important constraint: normally,
only stressed vowels can be long, i.e. there are no unstressed long vowels, while
stressed vowels can be either long or short. Since the vowel length and stress often
changes according to the word form (i.e. gender, case), this produces many
alternations:
dober (m) vs. duobra (f) good
rouka (N) vs. rukami (I-pl) hand
These are specific developments of old vowels and consonants in this dialect (other
‘Kajkavian’ dialects have very similar developments):

ö

Many ‘Kajkavian’ dialects (but not all) have -e instead of -o in all neuter nouns and
adjectives in neuter gender, i.e. sεεle village vs. std. selo.
When compared with the forms reconstructed for the old language – some 1000
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A8 Dialects
529 / 600

years ago – in most ‘Kajkavian’ dialects (but not all) the stress has shifted from the
very end of the word, becoming the ‘neoacute’ on the preceding syllable;
sometimes, the syllable that gets the stress will be lenghtened:
rööka → rouka hand
žena → žεεna woman, wife
viino → viino wine
The old jd and jt are mostly unchanged in ‘Kajkavian’, while t' changed into č, and in
most dialects d' into j.
There's no ć sound – only č, which is pronounced a bit ‘softer’ than in the Standard
Croatian. Consonants at the end of words become ‘devoiced’, i.e. d is pronounced
as t, b as p, g as k, z as s, etc. For instance, the z in mraz frost is actually pronounced
as s, while the pronunciation of genitive mraza is as z, since the consonant is not
final.
The present tense verb plural endings in this dialect are more regular than in
Standard Croatian; the ending for the 1st pers. plural is quite specific:
sing.

A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin
Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin are separate standard languages quite similar to
the Standard Croatian (some people consider them ‘variants’ of a single language). I
will summarize the most important differences.
You should keep in mind that there are regions in Croatia where some ‘Serbian’
words are used, and some ‘Croatian’ words can be found in Serbia as well. Of
course, Bosnian and Montenegrin are somewhere in the middle. Furthermore, we
can talk about ‘Croatian’ and ‘Serbian’ only if we discuss the standardized languages.
If we take into the account how people actually speak, the situation is much more
complex.
Spelling
The major difference is that Serbian and Montenegrin use another alphabet –
Cyrillic. However, each letter of Croatian Latin corresponds to one letter of Serbian
Cyrillic.
Actually, in Serbia today the Cyrillic alphabet is mostly used in official and
ceremonial uses. Majority of newspapers are published in the ‘Serbian Latin’ script
(identical to ‘Croatian Latin’). Web sites published in Cyrillic have usually a ‘LAT’
button somewhere. For instance, Politika daily has pages both in Cyrillic and Latin
(check CYR and LAT links on top), but B92 is in Latin only. Even the web site of
Serbian government has links ћирилица Cyrillic and latinica Latin on the top (Cyrillic
is chosen by default). Statistics show that about 1/6 of text on Serbian web sites is
written in the Cyrillic script.
In Montenegro, the Cyrillic alphabet is even less used. The web site of Montenegrin
government has the two links on top, but the Latin script is displayed as default.
Most web pages, even official ones, are in Latin script only.
Besides using Cyrillic script sometimes, there are few differences in spelling (both in
Serbian/Montenegrin Latin and Cyrillic). The first one is spelling of foreign names.
Serbian and Montenegrin usually respell them using approximated pronunciation:
original
  Serbian spelling
New York
Njujork
Њујорк
George Bush
Džordž Buš
Џорџ Буш
Chicago
Čikago
Чикаго
The second difference is spelling of the future tense. When an infinitive in -t is
immediately followed by an auxiliary ću², ćeš²... it’s spelled together, and the
infinitive-final -t is discarded, with possible sound mutations:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin
531 / 600

Croatian
      Serbian
pisat ću
pisaću
писаћу
jest ću
ješću
јешћу
reći ću
reći ću
рећи ћу
This is, however, merely a spelling convention: the words ću², ćeš² are second-
position words; therefore, Serbian words like pisaću are limited to the 1st position
in a sentence! They are usually listed as separate verb forms in Serbian grammars.
Ekavian ‘Pronunciation’
As I have already mentioned, there are three common ‘pronunciations’: Ijekavian,
Ikavian and Ekavian (there are more in various dialects, but these three prevail in
public). The name is misleading, since the difference is visible in spelling as well. The
basic difference is: where Standard Croatian has Ijekavian mlijeko, Ikavian has
mliko and Ekavian mleko for milk.
People usually associate Ekavian (mleko, pesma) and not Ijekavian (mlijeko,
pjesma) with Serbian, but it’s not really true, since Serbs use both as standard: most
Serbs outside of Serbia (e.g. Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro) use Ijekavian, and
Serbs in most of Serbia, including Belgrade, use only Ekavian. You can find both in
Serbian newspapers, but Ekavian clearly dominates. (The Serbian Standard is much
less strict than Croatian, there is a bigger choice of ‘acceptable’ variants.)
If you find a ‘dictionary of differences’ listing bijeli as ‘Croatian’ vs. beli as ‘Serbian’
you can immediately conclude it’s oversimplifying things.
There’s a tradition of playing down differences between Ekavian and Ijekavian: most
people, especially in Serbia, are used to hear and read both (but they can write and
speak only Ekavian). However, Ekavian forms are not completely trivial – they
cannot be completely obtained from (Standard Croatian) Ijekavian forms, and
Ijekavian forms cannot be obtained at all from Ekavian. For example, there are some
words where Ekavian has e, in comparison to Ijekavian i, like in these common
verbs:
verb
Ijekavian
Ekavian
heat
grijati (grije)
grejati (greje)
laugh
smijati (smije) se²
smejati (smeje) se²
hate
mrziti
mrzeti (mrzi)
sit
sjediti
sedeti (sedi)
be worth
vrijediti
vredeti (vredi)
These differences are sometimes surprising to native speakers as well: very few
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin
532 / 600

people in Croatia would guess the forms mrzeti and vredeti. Different verbs have to
be learned: the verb brijati (brije) shave has the same form in both ‘pronunciations’,
while grijati (grije) heat doesn’t. The verb sjediti shows the expected je vs. e in the
1st syllable, besides the unexpected i vs. e in the second one (the same holds for
vrijediti). Therefore, Ekavian forms of these verbs turn out to be more complicated.
However, the verb vidjeti and similar ones, including razumjeti, are much simpler in
Ekavian: their past forms are always regular, and verbs like razumjeti are plain verbs
in Ekavian, all forms regularly derived from the inf:
verb
Ijekavian
Ekavian
want
htjeti (hoće +, htio, htjela)
hteti (hoće +)
see
vidjeti (vidi, vidio, vidjela)
videti (vidi)
understand
razumjeti (razumije,...)
razumeti
may
smjeti (smije, smio, smijela) smeti
The Ekavian verbs razumeti and smeti have a specific ending in pres-3pl: -eju, which
is different from Ijekavian or Ikavian.
Sequences -je- in endings of verbal adjectives are not subject to these differences.
In all ‘pronunciations’, words voljen loved, primljen received etc. have the same
form.
The same applies to verbal nouns in -je; the difference in sjećanje vs. sećanje (both
meaning memory) is only in the 1st syllable; the final -je, which forms the gerund, is
not affected.
There are more words with non-trivial correspondences:
word
Ijekavian
Ekavian
part
dio (dijel-) deo (del-)
last year
lani
lane
lazy
lijen
lenj
When -je comes after a vowel which is not i (e.g. dvoje two people, jaje egg) the
forms are the same in Ekavian, Ijekavian and Ikavian. Of course, the same applies to
verbal forms such as pije he/she drinks nije he/she/it is not etc. Ekavian forms have
to be learned if you want to know them.
I will list Serbian words in both Ijekavian and Ekavian forms in this chapter.
Other partially regular differences
A major difference is loss of h in native words in Serbian (both Ekavian and
Ijekavian; however, it was restored at the beginning of words in standard Serbian). It
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin
533 / 600

has been replaced by either v or j:
term
Croatian
Serbian
deaf
gluh
gluv
dry
suh
suv
fly (insect)
muha
muva
cook (verb) kuhati
kuvati
son’s wife
snaha
snaja
In nouns ending in -ol, Serbian (both Ekavian and Ijekavian) had lost final -l, which is
restored whenever any ending is added. It also happened to -r in nouns and adverbs
ending in -er:
term
Croatian
Serbian
salt
sol f
so (sol-) f
table
stol
sto (stol-) m
ox
vol
vo (vol-) m
evening
večer f
veče (večer- f)
yesterday
jučer
juče
also
također
takođe
This change didn’t happen in bol pain.
The noun veče is considered neuter in N and A, and feminine when it gets any
ending, which is an occasional source of confusion for native speakers.
There are a bit simplified forms or pronouns; however, these forms are colloquially
used in Croatia as well:
term
Croatian
Serbian
who
tko
ko
someone
netko
neko
what
što
šta
In some words there’s su in Croatian vs. sa in Serbian, while in others there’s no
difference; common examples are:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin
534 / 600

term
Croatian
Serbian
cooperation
suradnja
saradnja
consent
suglasnost f
saglasnost f
conflict
              sukob
contents
              sadržaj
As you can see, such words often correspond to English words with co- or con-, but
there’s no real rule which words have the difference, and which don’t.

Especially, terms related to cooking, food, and standard house items show
numerous differences; these terms are often completely unknown outside their
'territory':

However, in real life, the variation in culinary terms is much greater, especially
within Croatia. Some ‘Croatian’ terms like riža and mrkva are also used in Serbia,
especially in some parts, and sometimes a distinction is made between mrkva and
šargarepa.
There are numerous differences in scientific terms, especially chemistry and biology:

vodik
vodonik

Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin

However, prison cell is just ćelija in both Croatian and Serbian. Croatian uses obitelj
f for human family, while Serbian uses porodica, and both usually use just porodica
for families in biology (sets of closely related species).
There are also different terms in math, and generally school:
term
Croatian
Serbian
triangle
trokut
trougao (trougl-)
rule (to draw lines)
ravnalo
lenjir
straight line
pravac (pravc-)

lecture, class in school
sat

class (group of students) razred
odjeljenje
odeljenje
However, notice that razred in both Croatia and Serbia means grade in school (e.g.
prvi razred first grade).
Some words have only a slightly different form due to different adaptation of
foreign words (this table includes only characteristic words showing ways words
differ):
term

The form kaseta is standard in Croatian as well, but it’s very rare in real use.
Some words adapted from Greek have k- in Croatian, and h- in Serbian; another,
less common difference in such words is -b- vs -v-, and -c- vs -k-:

There are more different names, these are just the most common; the difference
applies to derived adjectives and names of inhabitants, of course. Additionally,
there’s a difference in adjectives derived from places ending in -iški:
term

Serbian
Parisian

Words related to government, having the suffix -kracija in Croatian, have -kratija in
Serbian:
term
Croatian
Serbian
bureucracy
birokracija
birokratija
democracy

demokratija
There are terms which correspond to two words in Croatia – an ‘international’ one,
and a word made from Slavic roots (or borrowed from Czech in the 19th century) –
which are used interchangeably, or one is formal and the other colloquial, or there’s
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin
539 / 600

a small difference in meaning, while only the ‘international’ word in used in Serbian.
Common pairs are:
term
Croatian
Serbian & Croatian
library
knjižnica
biblioteka
machine
stroj
mašina
music
glazba
muzika
system
sustav
sistem
For example, in Croatia, only knjižnica is used for public libraries, while biblioteka
can mean any book collection, e.g. in someone’s home.
In Serbian, suffixes -ka and -kinja are more common to derive feminine nouns, while
Croatian prefers -ica; again, in some terms there’s no difference:
term
Croatian
Serbian
university student (f) studentica
studentkinja
doctor (f)
doktorica
doktorka
teacher (f)
          učiteljica
mathematician (f)
          matematičarka
Forms studentica and doktorica are accepted as standard in Serbian as well, but are
much less common than the alternative forms.
There are some specific adjectives as well; again, some are only slightly different:
term

Vocabulary differences in verbs
Verbs ending in -isati (-iše) are very characteristic of Serbia and most of Bosnia; they
usually correspond to Croatian verbs in -irati («). They are all adaptations of foreign
words. Common ones are:
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin

(The thin vertical line, as usual, divides the constant part on the left of it from the
variable part on the right.) They also have stress on different syllables.
However, it’s completely wrong to think that all Croatian verbs in -irati correspond
to Serbian verbs in this way. In fact, there are many verbs in -irati used in Serbia as
well, such as:
analizirati («) analyze
diplomirati («) graduate (on univ.)
kopirati («) copy
kreirati («) create
maskirati («) mask
parkirati («) park (a car)
planirati («) plan
studirati («) study (on univ.)
šokirati («) shock
trenirati («) train
varirati («) vary
etc.
Also, some Croatian -irati verbs correspond to Serbian ones in -ovati (-uje).
Common ones are:

            Serbian
improvise

Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / A9 Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin

When such verbs have -cirati in Croatian, they have -kovati in Serbian:
verb

            Serbian
disinfect, sanitize

Occasionally, there’s a non-trivial correspondence to Croatian -irati verbs:
verb

Many recently adapted verbs – mostly colloquial – often have just -ati in Croatia vs -
ovati (-uje) in Serbia:

lajkati
lajk ovati (-uje)
surf

There are few more verbs are used a bit differently in Serbian.
The verb smjeti (smije, smio, smjela) may – in Ekavian form smeti – has an
additional meaning in Serbia: dare.
The verb umjeti (umije, umio, umjela) know how – in Ekavian form umeti – is quite
common in Serbia:
Umijem da plivam! I know how to swim. (Ijekavian)
Umem da plivam! (the same, Ekavian)

Grammar and other differences
Adverbs puno/jako vs. mnogo are characteristic in meaning a lot, very. Of course,
vrlo can be used as well, but it’s not used in speech much. The use of these adverbs
is different in Croatian and Serbian:
Puno hvala! Thanks a lot. (mostly Croatian)
Mnogo hvala! Thanks a lot. (Serbian, sometimes Croatian)
Jako sam umorna. I’m very tired. (mostly Croatian)
Mnogo sam umorna. I’m very tired. (Serbian)
Vrlo sam umorna. I’m very tired. (both languages, more formal)
Observe that mnogo is normally used in both Croatian and Serbian meaning much
before comparatives: mnogo veći much bigger. This is a subtle difference.
There some often-used nicknames for men in Serbia ending in -a: Pera (from Petar),
Vlada (from Vladimir and similar), Brana (from Branislav), etc., all behaving as any
name ending in -a. They are quite rare in Croatia, where forms Pero, Vlado, etc. are
preferred.
A famous difference is preference for da + present instead of infinitives in Serbia.
Using infinitives in Serbia is not ungrammatical, but they are simply rarely used
(especially in speech); these results are from Google™, in thousands (try yourself
similar expressions):

As usual, Bosnia (which includes Ijekavian Serbian in parts of Bosnia) is somewhere
in between.
Montenegrin
Montengrin uses more or less the same vocabulary and spelling conventions as
Serbian, but only the Ijekavian variant. It uses few specific forms, like nijesmo vs.
Croatian/Serbian nismo we aren’t. Words having sequences dj in Croatian often
have đ in Montenegrin:

Recently the Montenegrin alphabet introduced two additional letters: ś and ź (there
are Cyrillic versions as well) for specific consonants heard in speech there – but they
are rarely used in real life.
It has been observed that Montenegrin public media have recently started to use
more Croatian forms than before.
Bosnian
Bosnian (or: Bosniak, there’s a dispute over name – there are disputes about almost
everything) uses only Latin script and Ijekavian. Two spelling differences (e.g.
Njujork and imaću) are used sometimes in Bosnian, but it seems that Croatian
versions occasionally prevail (New York, imat ću). Standard Bosnian sometimes
freely mixes Croatian and Serbian terms, so both tisuća and hiljada 1000 seem
acceptable.
Since Bosnian is a standard used by Bosniaks which are predominantly Muslim, there
are lot of oriental and Islamic terms. Sound h is always retained, even when not in
Croatian (one example is lahko easy vs Croatian lako; of course, lahko exists in
some dialects in Croatia too, but it’s not standard). There are some specific terms,
e.g. daidža uncle (Croatian ujak).
Bosnia-Herzegovina is today officially tri-lingual, as evidenced by this warning on a
box of cigarettes that displays three identical sentences (the first one is just in
Cyrillic; I have taken a photo of an actual box):

These are common male names ending in -o or -e; when they get any case ending,
the final vowel is removed (e.g. Marko → A Marka):
Darko
Hrvoje
Jadranko    
Karlo
Leo
Marko *   
Mateo *
Matko
Mirko
Roko
Silvije
Slavko    
Vlatko
Zlatko
Žarko
Željko
The following male names are common in Dubrovnik and the surrounding area; they
change as Marko:
Đivo    
Niko
Pavo    
Stijepo    
Vlaho
These are common male names ending in -io; when they get any case ending, it's
attached to -ij- (e.g. Mario → A Marija):
Antonio    
Dario

These are common male names ending in -a. They change as any noun in -a:
Andrija

Luka
Matija    
Nikola *
Saša
Some of these names, e.g. Borna, Ivica and Saša as sometimes used as female

Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / L1 Common Names
546 / 600

L2 Countries and Nationalities
(under construction; some stress marks and data missing)
This is a list of often used country and region names, in Croatian, together with
associated adjectives, and names of inhabitants (both male and female
The first line contains the English name of a region/country, the Croatian name, and
if the name is an really an adjective, there's a mark (adj.); otherwise, adjective is
listed after an arrow; then there are names for inhabitants, first male, then female,
separated by a tilde.
Although the names of inhabitants are unpredictable, there are couple of common
patterns. Nouns for many inhabitants follow the ‘ac/ka scheme’:
Amerikanac (Amerikanc-) ~ Amerikanka
The part before -ac, -c- and -ka stays the same (but observe the stress shift left in
feminine, in the standard stress scheme!) so there's no need to list all forms over
and over; I'll instead just write – in the usual way:
Amerikan ac (-c-) ~ -ka
There's a scheme that's a small variation to the previous, the ‘ac/kinja scheme’:
Danac (Danc-) ~ Dankinja
It applies only to short names (one syllable before -ac), and there's no stress shift.
I'll write just:
Dan ac (-c-) ~ -kinja
There's yet another common scheme for nouns, where male noun is always
shortened in plural forms, the ‘in/ka scheme’:
Kanađanin (N-pl Kanađani) ~ Kanađanka
Observe that the stress is the same in male and female noun. I'll write just:
Kanađan in (N-pl -i) ~ -ka
Regardless of the scheme, the endings, there's a rule for all nouns for male
inhabitants: they always have plural with just -i, regardless of number of syllables:
Hrvat Croat → Hrvati
Rus Russian → Rusi
This means that consonant shifts in masculine N-pl apply as well:
Čeh Czech → Česi
Grk Greek → Grci
Furthermore, certain names of male inhabitants have specific forms (listed below)
and are marked by an asterisk (*).
Some countries have more than one name for inhabitants in use; the more common
is listed first.

Križevci m pl.
Prelog
Županja
Since Križevci and Vinkovci would have two consonants before the G-pl ending -a,
they are split by another a:
Križevci → iz Križevaca
Vinkovci → iz Vinkovaca
The following names consist of an adjective + noun:
Beli Manastir
Donja Stubica
Donji Miholj ac (-c-)
Duga Resa
Dugo Selo
Grubišno Polje
Hrvatska Kostajnica
Mali Lošinj
Mursko Središće
Nova Gradiška
Novi Marof
Slavonski Brod
Stari Grad
Sveta Nedelja
Varaždinske Toplice f pl.
Velika Gorica
There are four specific names:
Biograd na Moru – only the 1st word changes
Ivanić-Grad – only the last part changes
Novi Vinodolski – contains two adjectives
Sveti Ivan Zelina – contains an adjective and two nouns
These names are often shortened to just Biograd, Ivanić, Novi and Zelina, and
change normally (Novi like an adjective).
Warning. Some towns have names that deviate from Standard Croatian, e.g. it’s
rather Sveta Nedelja instead of Nedjelja.
These major cities in Europe have Croatian names different than English ones:
Atena Athens
Beč Vienna
Beograd Belgrade
Budimpešta Budapest
Bukurešt Bucharest
Kijev Kiev
Napulj Naples
Prag Prague
Rim Rome
Solun Salonica
Trst Trieste
Venecija Venice
Several German, Italian, Polish and Russian cities have names closer to native ones
than in English:
Keln Cologne
Milano Milan
Minhen Munich
Moskva Moscow
Torino Turin
Varšava Warsaw
Some major cities in Europe have slightly specific pronunciation in Croatian:
Berlin
London
Madrid
Pariz
Adjectives are normally derived from cities and towns (except ones that are already
adjectives) by adding -ski. However, some cities have irregular forms or there are
consonant alternations:
Beč → bečki
Pariz → pariški

Core Dictionary
A small, 'core' dictionary is included.
Each item contains a base word, and one or more derived words:
brod m ship
· brodski rel adj.
— base word
— derived word
Each word is defined with its form (here: brod), type (here: m) and meaning (here:
ship). The types are abbreviated as follows:
m
noun, masculine gender (not people/animals)
mª
noun, masculine gender (people/animals)
f
noun, feminine gender
n
noun, neuter gender
adj.
adjective
pass. adj.
passive adjective
adv.
adverb
impf.
verb, imperfective
perf.
verb, perfective
v.p.
verb pair: an imperfective and a perfective verb
v.t.
verb triplet: an imperfective and 2 perfective verbs
Both nouns and adjectives with specific case-bases have them immediately after
their nominative form.
Nouns with non-obvious forms are listed with them. If a noun uses the preposition
na¨ in a obvious way (e.g. not on table), it's marked in the following way:
l/a
physical location/destination
act.
used metaphorically, as activity (e.g. na kavi)
met.
meteorological conditions (e.g. na suncu)
Terms with gender pairs (mª and f) are listed in a way that the generic noun comes
first. For example, prijatelj mª stands for both masculine and generic friend; the
same holds for lav mª lion; for a group of friends of mixed sex, you would use
prijatelji; for a group of lions, lavovi, unless all are females.
However, generic names for cat and fox are mačka f and lisica f; you would use
masculine terms only for those cats and foxes you're sure they are masculine; for a
mixed group of cats, you would use mačke. Therefore, feminine nouns are listed
first for cat and fox.
It's assumed that two-syllable masc. nouns that have one-syllable case-base get just
an -i in N-pl, as all masc. nouns with more than one syllable do:
kupac (kupc-) mª customer, buyer → N-pl kupci
When it's not the case, the N-pl is listed (and all plural forms follow from it):
Easy Croa!an (rev. 47b) / Core Dic!onary
554 / 600

češalj (češlj-) m (N-pl češljevi)
Adjectives (except for passive and relational adjectives) are assumed to have regular
comparatives (with -iji). If it's not so, the comparative is listed, if there's no
comparative, it's again marked as (no comp.)
Verbs are listed with their arguments. Besides standard abbreviations (i.e. A =
accusative, etc.) there are the following ones:
CC
content clause
DC
desire clause
INF
another verb in infinitive
Certain entries have a link to a chapter (or more chapters) with examples and usage
notes, marked with §.
After that, there are regional and other variations, in curly braces {...}. They use the
following abbreviations:
B
parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina
colloq.
colloquial in most of Croatia
E
Ekavian (used in Serbia)
HL
h-less: Serbia, parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, colloquially parts of Croatia
I

M
